Preface 


W ELCOME TO THE EIGHTH EDITION OF JANSON’S CLASSIC TEXTBOOK, 

officially renamed Janson’s History of Art in its seventh edition to 
reflect its relationship to the book that introduced generations of stu¬ 
dents to art history. For many of us who teach introductory courses in 
the history of art, the name Janson is synonymous with the subject matter we present. 


When Pearson/Prentice Hall first published the History of Art in 
1962, John F. Kennedy occupied the White House, and Andy 
Warhol was an emerging artist. Janson offered his readers a strong 
focus on Western art, an important consideration of technique 
and style, and a clear point of view. The History of Art , said 
Janson, was not just a stringing together of historically significant 
objects, but the writing of a story about their interconnections— 
a history of styles and of stylistic change. Janson s text focused on 
the visual and technical characteristics of the objects he discussed, 
often in extraordinarily eloquent language. Janson s History of Art 
helped to establish the canon of art history for many generations 
of scholars. 

Although revised to remain current with new discoveries and 
scholarship, this new edition continues to follow Janson s lead in 
important ways: It is limited to the Western tradition, with a 
chapter on Islamic art and its relationship to Western art. It keeps 
the focus of the discussion on the object, its manufacture, and its 
visual character. It considers the contribution of the artist as an 
important part of the analysis. This edition maintains an organi¬ 
zation along the lines established by Janson, with separate 
chapters on the Northern European Renaissance, the Italian 
Renaissance, the High Renaissance, and Baroque art, with stylis¬ 
tic divisions for key periods of the modern era. Also embedded in 
this edition is the narrative of how art has changed over time in 
the cultures that Europe has claimed as its patrimony. 


WHAT’S NEW IN 
JANSON’S HISTORY OF ART ? 

“The history of art is too vast a field for anyone to encompass 
all of it with equal competence.” 

H. W. JANSON, from the Preface to the first edition of History of Art 

Janson’s History of Art in its eighth edition is once again the 
product of careful revision by a team of scholars with different 
specialties, bringing a readily recognized knowledge and depth 
to the discussions of works of art. We incorporate new inter¬ 
pretations such as the reidentification of the “Porticus Aemilia” 
as Romes Navalia, or ship-shed (p. 186); new documentary 
evidence, such as that pertaining to Uccello s Battle of San 
Romano (p. 538); and new interpretive approaches, such as the 
importance of nationalism in the development of Romanticism 
(Chapter 24). 

Organization and Contextual Emphasis 

Most chapters integrate the media into chronological discussions 
instead of discussing them in isolation from one another, which 
reflected the more formalistic approach used in earlier editions. 
Even though we draw connections among works of art, as Janson 
did, we emphasize the patronage and function of works of art and 


the historical circumstances in which they were created. We 
explore how works of art have been used to shore up political or 
social power. 

Interpreting Cultures 

Western art history encompasses a great many distinct chronolog¬ 
ical and cultural periods, which we wish to treat as distinct enti¬ 
ties. So we present Etruscan art as evidence for Etruscan culture, 
not as a precursor of Roman or a follower of Greek art. 
Recognizing the limits of our knowledge about certain periods of 
history, we examine how art historians draw conclusions from 
works of art. The boxes called The Art Historian's Lens allow stu¬ 
dents to see how the discipline works. They give students a better 
understanding of the methods art historians use to develop art- 
historical arguments. Primary Sources , a distinguishing feature of 
Janson for many editions, have been incorporated throughout the 
chapters to support the analysis provided and to further inform 
students about the cultures discussed, and additional documents 
can be found in the online resource, MyArtsLab. (See p. xix for 
more detail.) 

Women in the History of Art 

Women continue to be given greater visibility as artists, as patrons, 
and as an audience for works of art. Inspired by contemporary 
approaches to art history, we also address the representation of 
women as expressions of specific cultural notions of femininity or 
as symbols. 

Objects, Media, and Techniques 

Many new objects have been incorporated into this edition to 
reflect the continuous changes in the discipline. The mediums we 
discuss are broad in scope and include not only modern art forms 
such as installations and earth art, but also the so-called minor arts 
of earlier periods—such as tapestries, metalwork, and porcelain. 
Discussions in the Materials and Techniques boxes illuminate this 
dimension of art history. 

The Images 

Along with the new objects that have been introduced, every 
reproduction in the book has been reexamined for excellence in 
quality, and when not meeting our standards has been replaced. 
Whenever possible we obtain our photography directly from the 
holding institutions to ensure that we have the most accurate and 
authoritative illustrations. Every image that could be obtained in 
color has been acquired. To further assist both students and teach¬ 
ers, we have sought permission for electronic educational use so 
that instructors who adopt Janson’s History of Art will have access 
to an extraordinary archive of high-quality (over 300 dpi) digital 
images for classroom use. (See p. xix for more detail on the 
Prentice Hall Digital Art Library.) 


New Map and Timelines 

A new map program has been created to both orient students to 
the locations mentioned in each chapter and to better tell the story 
of the chapter narrative. Readers now can see the extent of the 
Eastern and Western Roman Empires, as well as the range of the 
Justinian’s rule (p. 236). They can trace the migration routes of 
tribes during early medieval times (p. 314) and the Dutch trade 
routes of the seventeenth century (p. 702). This enriching new fea¬ 
ture provides an avenue for greater understanding of the impact 
of politics, society, and geography on the art of each period. End 
of chapter timelines recap in summary fashion the art and events 
of the chapter, as well as showing key contemporaneous works 
from previous chapters (for example, pp. 345 and 759). 

Chaper by Chaper Revisions 

The following list includes the major highlights of this new edition: 

CHAPTER 1 : PREHISTORIC ART 

Expands upon the methods scholars (both art historians and 
anthropologists) use to understand artwork, including, for 
instance, feminist interpretations. Includes new monuments such 
as Skara Brae and Mezhirich. A new box explains dating techniques. 

CHAPTER 2: ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN ART 

This chapter is expanded to include a discussion of Jerusalem. 

CHAPTER 3: EGYPTIAN ART 

Now includes a tomb painting from the pre-Dynastic age, and a 
discussion of jewelry. A new box names the major Egyptian gods. 

CHAPTER 4: AEGEAN ART 

Improved images and a reconstruction of Mycenae enhance the 
discussion of Aegean art. 

CHAPTER 5: GREEK ART 

This chapter is tightened to allow space for longer discussion of 
Greek sanctuaries, and the inclusion of Hellenistic works outside 
of the Greek mainland, such as the Pharos at Alexandria. The 
issue of homosexuality in fifth-century Athens is addressed, as 
well as womens roles in life and art. A new box deals with the 
issue of repatriation of works of art such as the Elgin marbles. 

CHAPTER 6: ETRUSCAN ART 

The range of artworks is increased to include, for instance, terra¬ 
cotta revetments and terra-cotta portraits. 

CHAPTER 7: ROMAN ART 

This chapter includes new interpretations such as the reidentifi¬ 
cation of the “Porticus Aemilia” as Romes Navalia or ship-shed. 
It also has been tightened to allow space for more Republican 
works (such as the terra cotta pediment from Via di San Gregorio 
and the Praeneste mosaic) and a wider discussion of life in 
Pompeii. There is some rearrangement of art works to improve 
the chronological flow. 


PREFACE XV 


CHAPTER 8: EARLY CHRISTIAN 
AND BYZANTINE ART 

A new section on early Jewish art is added, including three images 
of early synagogue wall paintings and mosaics (Dura Europos and 
Hammath Tiberias). Coverage of Late Byzantine art is increased, 
as is discussion of liturgical and social history. 

CHAPTER 9: ISLAMIC ART 

The relationship of Islamic art to early Jewish and Christian 
medieval art is accentuated. 

CHAPTER 1 0: EARLY MEDIEVAL ART 

Includes an expanded discussion and reorganization of Viking art, 
which is now placed later in the chapter. 

CHAPTER 1 1 : ROMANESQUE ART 

Coverage of secular architecture is broadened to include the 
bridge at Puente la Reina on the pilgrimage route to Santiago 
de Compostela and a new section on the crusades and castle 
architecture. 

CHAPTER 1 2: GOTHIC ART 

This chapter is tightened to allow space for added focus on secu¬ 
lar objects and buildings with the inclusion of a Guillaume de 
Machaut manuscript illumination and Westminster Hall from the 
royal palace in London. There is also expanded discussion of 
courtly art and royal iconography in later Gothic monuments. 

CHAPTER 1 3: ART IN THIRTEENTH- 
AND FOURTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 

Organization now places less emphasis on religious architecture. 
Sienas Palazzo Pubblico is added. There is a more focused discus¬ 
sion of Tuscany, and a briefer treatment of Northern Italy and 
Venice. Images of key works of art, including Nicola and 
Giovanni Pisano and the Arena chapel are improved. Two maps 
in the chapter outline Italian trade routes and the spread of the 
plague in the 1340s. 

CHAPTER 1 4: ARTISTIC INNOVATIONS IN 
FIFTEENTH-CENTURY NORTHERN EUROPE 

Discussion of the Tres Riches Heures du Due de Berry is enlarged, 
and reproductions contrasting aristocratic “labors” and the 
images of peasants are added. Treatment of works by Van Eyck, 
Van der Weyden and Bosch is revised and sharpened. A new map 
of centers of production and trade routes in Northern Europe 
illustrates the variety of media produced in the region. 

CHAPTER 1 5: THE EARLY RENAISSANCE 
IN FIFTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 

Reorganized for better flow and student comprehension, this 
chapter now begins with the Baptistery competition illustrating 
reliefs by both Ghiberti and Brunelleschi. It then looks at archi¬ 
tectural projects by Brunelleschi and Alberti in Florence as a 
group, considering their patronage and function as well as their 
form. New art illustrates Brunelleschis innovations at the 
Duomo, while his work at San Lorenzo is expanded to include the 


Old Sacristy. Section on domestic life has been revised, but it still 
offers a contextualized discussion of works such as Donatello s 
David , Uccellos Battle of San Romano and Botticellis Birth of 
Venus. This section now includes the Strozzi cassone at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Verrocchio s 
Lady with a Bunch of Flowers. The discussion of Renaissance style 
throughout Italy is revised for greater clarity. 

CHAPTER 16: THE HIGH RENAISSANCE 
IN ITALY, 1 495-1 520 

A discussion of the portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci is now included, 
permitting a revised discussion of the Mona Lisa. The section on 
the Stanza della Segnatura is revamped to focus on The School of 
Athens. Treatment of Giorgione and Titian is reorganized and 
revised to reflect current discussions of attribution and collabora¬ 
tion. A new Titian portrait, Man with a Blue Sleeve , is included. 

CHAPTER 17: THE LATE RENAISSANCE AND 
MANNERISM IN SI XTEEN TH-CEN TU RY ITALY 

Florence in the sixteenth century is reorganized and refreshed 
with new images, including a view of the architectural context for 
Pontormo s Piet a. Michelangelo s New Sacristy is treated in terms 
of architecture as well as sculpture. Ducal Palaces of the Uffizi 
and the Pitti and of the Boboli Gardens receives a new focus. 
Cellinis Saltceller of Francis I is discussed in its Florentine 
context. Treatment of II Gesu is revamped. New images enliven 
the Northern Italian art section and Sofonisba Anguissola s Self 
Portrait is compared to Parmigianino s. There is a revised con¬ 
sideration of Palladio, and a new Titian, The Rape of Euro pa , 
exemplifies the artist s work for elite patrons. 

CHAPTER 18: RENAISSANCE AND 
REFORMATION IN SI XTEEN TH-CEN TU RY 
NORTHERN EUROPE 

Discussion of France, as well as Spain, is revised and images are 
improved. Includes new images and discussions of Cranach and 
Baldung: Cranach s Judgment of Paris in New York replaces 
another version of this theme, while Baldung is represented by his 
woodcut of The Bewitched Groom of 1544. The discussion of 
Holbein is enlivened by consideration of his Jean de Dinteville 
and Georges de Selve (“The Ambassadors”), allowing examination 
of him as an allegorist as well as a portraitist. Gossaert is now 
represented by the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516, while a new 
Patinir, the triptych of The Penitence of Saint Jerome , represents 
the landscape specialty of that region. 

CHAPTER 1 9: THE BAROQUE IN ITALY 
AND SPAIN 

Chapter content benefits from insights gained through recent 
exhibitions and from the inclusion of new architectural image 
components. New illustrations better expand understanding of 
the Roman Baroque and the role of the Virgin in Spanish art, 
including a view of the Piazza Navonna that shows Bernini s Four 
Rivers Fountain and as well as Borromini s church of S. Agnese, a 
cut-away of Borromini s complex star-hexagon shaped church, 


XVI PREFACE 


S. Ivo, and one of Murillo’s many depictions of the Immaculate 
Conception (St. Petersburg). 

CHAPTER 20: THE BAROQUE 
IN THE NETHERLANDS 

The importance of trade, trade routes and interest in the exotic is 
explored in this chapter. Gender issues—and the relationship 
between men and women—and local, folk traditions (religious 
and secular) play a role here in the exploration of the visual cul¬ 
ture and social history. New images include: Peter Paul Rubens’ 
The Raising of the Cross —the entire open altarpiece; Peter Paul 
Rubens’ Four Studies of the Head of a Negro; Jacob Jordaens’ The 
King Drinks; Judith Leyster’s The Proposition; Rembrandt van 
Rijn’s Bathsheba with King David's Letter , and Vermeer’s Officer 
and Laughing Girl. 

CHAPTER 21: THE BAROQUE IN FRANCE 
AND ENGLAND 

New scholarship from the Poussin and Nature: Arcadian Visions 
exhibition in 2008 informs a more developed discussion of this 
artist’s work. A fuller discussion of the role of the 1668 Fire of 
London and the re-building of St. Paul’s Cathedral, in addition to a 
three-dimensional reconstruction of St. Paul’s and a modern recon¬ 
struction of Sir Christopher Wren’s plan of the city of London 
drawn just days after the fire, expands the coverage of this architect. 

CHAPTER 22: THE ROCOCO 

Expresses in greater depth the concept of the Rococo, the role of 
Madame da Pompadour and the expansion of the Rococo style in 
Germany. New images include Francois Boucher’s Portrait of 
Madame de Pompadour (Munich); Jean-Simeon Chardin’s The 
Brioche (the Dessert) and Egid Quirin Asam’s interior and altar of 
the Benedictine Church at Rohr. Sections of this chapter are reor¬ 
ganized to accommodate the removal of Marie-Louise Elisabeth 
Vigee-Lebrun, Sir Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua 
Reynolds to Chapter 23. 

CHAPTER 23: ART IN THE AGE OF 
THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 

Slightly restructured, the chapter keeps Neoclassicism and early 
Romanticism separated, thus making them more clearly defined. 
Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and Vigee-Lebrun are 
placed here and into the context of Neoclassicism and 
Romanticism. Antonio Canova also is moved to this chapter to 
emphasize his importance in the development of Neoclassicism. 
Image changes include Joseph Wright’s more clearly Romantic 
The Old Man and Death; Ledoux’s Custom House with the 
entrance to the Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans; as well as the addition 
of Canova s tomb of Archduchess Maria Christina. 

CHAPTER 24: ART IN THE AGE OF 
ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 

This chapter is tightened and has several new images. William 
Blake is now represented by Elohim Creating Adam and Corot by 
Souvenir de Montre fontaine (Oise). Frederick Church’s Twilight in 


the Wilderness is added. The discussion of architecture is changed 
by placing the Empire style at the very end, thus keeping the 
Neoclassical revival together. 

CHAPTER 25: THE AGE OF POSITIVISM: 
REALISM, IMPRESSIONISM, AND THE 
PRE-RAPHAELITES, 1 848-1 885 

Includes a number of image changes to better focus discussions. 
These include: Monet’s Gare St. Lazare; Rossetti’s Proserpine; 
Nadar’s portrait Edouard Manet; and Le Gray’s Brig on the Water. 

CHAPTER 26: PROGRESS AND ITS 
DISCONTENTS: POST-IMPRESSIONISM, 
SYMBOLISM, AND ART NOUVEAU, 

1 880-1 905 

Now incorporates discussions of vernacular, or amateur, photog¬ 
raphy, represented by Henri Lartigue’s Avenue du Bois de Bologne; 
Woman with Furs , and the advent of film, represented by Thomas 
Edison’s New Brooklyn to New York via Brooklyn Bridge. 

CHAPTER 27: TOWARD ABSTRACTION: 

THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 

Discussion of the formal and stylistic developments between 1904 
and 1914 that culminated in abstractionism is tightened and the 
number of images reduced. 

CHAPTER 28: ART BETWEEN THE WARS 

More compact discussion structured around the impact of World 
War I and the need to create utopias and uncover higher realities, 
especially as seen in Surrealism. 

CHAPTER 29: POSTWAR TO POSTMODERN, 

1 945-1 980 

Polke is placed here from Chapter 30, thus putting him within the 
context of an artist influenced by Pop Art. David Hammons is 
moved to Chapter 30. Betye Saar’s Shield of Quality adds a 
woman to the discussion of African-American artists. 

CHAPTER 30: THE POSTMODERN ERA: 

ART SINCE 1 980 

Architecture is reduced, and fine art is expanded. Neo- 
Expressionism benefits from the addition of Julian Schnabel’s The 
Exile. The multi-culturalism of the period receives greater 
emphasis, especially feminism. Barbara Kruger is placed in a more 
feminist context with inclusion of a new image, Untitled (We 
Won't Play Nature to Your Culture). The discussion of African- 
American identity is broadened by the placement of David 
Hammons here, and by the addition of Kara Walker’s Insurrection 
(Our Tools Were Rudimentary , Yet We Pressed On). Fred Wilson’s 
Mining the Museum is also included. The discussion of Gonzalez- 
Torres now stresses his involvement with the AIDS crisis. The 
importance of large-scale photography for the period is rein¬ 
forced by the addition of Andreas Gursky’s Shanghai. The truly 
global nature of contemporary art is strengthened by the addition 
of El Antsui’s Dzesi II.

Introduction 


W HY IN 1 962 DID ANDY WARHOL MAKE A PAINTING ENTITLED 

Gold Marilyn Monroe (fig. 1.1)? This almost 7-foot-high canvas was 
produced shortly after the death of the Hollywood screen star and 
sex symbol. It was not commissioned and obviously Monroe never 
“sat” for it, an activity that we generally associate with portraiture. Instead, Warhol 


worked from a press photograph, a still from the 1953 movie 
Niagara , which he cropped to his liking and then transferred onto 
canvas using silkscreen. This process involves mechanically trans¬ 
ferring the photograph onto a mesh screen, or in this case several 
screens, one for each color, and pressing printing ink through 
them onto canvas. Warhol then surrounded Marilyn s head with a 
field of broadly brushed gold paint. 

Warhol s painting is not a conventional portrait of Monroe but 
rather a pastiche of the public image of the film star as propagated 
by the mass media. Warhol imitates the sloppy, gritty look and 
feel of color newspaper reproductions of the period, when the 
colors were often misregistered, aligning imperfectly with the 
image, and the colors themselves were “off,” meaning not quite 
right. The Marilyn we are looking at is the impersonal celebrity of 
the media, the commodity being pushed by the film industry. She 
is supposedly glamorous, with her lush red lipstick and bright 
blond hair, but instead she appears pathetically tacky because of 
the grimy black ink and the garish color of her blond hair as it 
becomes bright yellow and her flesh tone turns pink. Her person¬ 
ality is impenetrable, reduced to a sad, lifeless public smile. 
Prompted by Monroe s suicide, Gold Marilyn Monroe presents 
the real Marilyn—a depressed, often miserable person, who, in

this textureless, detailless, unnaturalistic image, is becoming a blur 
fading into memory. Warhol has brilliantly expressed the indiffer¬ 
ence of the mass media, whose objective is to promote celebrities 
by saturating a thirsty public with their likenesses but which tells 
us nothing meaningful about them and shows no concern for them. 
Monroe s image is used simply to sell a product, much as the allur¬ 
ing and often jazzy packaging of Brillo soap pads or Campbell s 
soup cans is designed to make a product alluring without telling 
us anything about the product itself. The packaging is just camou¬ 
flage. As a sentimental touch, Warhol floats Marilyn s head in a 
sea of gold paint, embedding her in an eternal realm previously 
reserved for use in icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary, which 
immerse these religious figures in a spiritual aura of golden, heav¬ 
enly light (see fig. 13.22). But Warhols revered Marilyn is sadly 
dwarfed by her celestial gold surrounding, adding to the tragic 
sense of this powerful portrait, which trenchantly comments on the 
enormous gulf existing between public image and private reality. 

If we turn the clock back some 200 years and look at a portrait 
by the Boston painter John Singleton Copley, we again see an 
image of a woman (fig. 1.2). But, made as it was in a different time 
and context, the story surrounding the painting is entirely differ¬ 
ent. The sitter is Freelove Olney Scott, and she is presented as a 
refined-looking woman, born, we would guess, into an aristo¬ 
cratic family, used to servants and power. As a matter of fact, we 
have come to accept Copleys portraits of colonial Bostonians, 
such as Mrs. Joseph Scott, as accurate depictions of their subjects

and lifestyles. But many, like Mrs. Scott, were not what they 
appear to be. So, who was Mrs. Scott? Let’s take a closer look at 
the context in which the painting was made. 

Copley is recognized as the first great American painter. 
Working in Boston from about 1754 to 1774, he became the most 
sought-after portraitist of the period. Copley easily outstripped 
the meager competition, most of whom actually earned their living 
painting signs and coaches. After all, no successful British artist 
had any reason to come to America. The economically struggling 
colonies were not a strong market for art. Only occasionally was 
a portrait commissioned, and typically, artists were treated like 
craftsmen rather than intellectuals. Like most colonial portraitists, 
Copley was largely self-taught, learning his trade by looking at 
black-and-white prints of paintings by the European masters. 

As we can see in Mrs. Joseph Scott , Copley was a master of 
painting textures, which is all the more astonishing when we 
remember that he had no one to teach him the tricks of the 
painter’s trade. His pictorial illusions are so convincing, we think 
we are looking at real silk, ribbons, lace, pearls, skin, hair, and 
marble, quite the opposite of Warhol’s artificial Marilyn. Copley’s 
contemporaries also marveled at his sleight of hand. No other 
colonial painter attained such a level of realism. 

But is Copley just a “face painter,” as portraitists were deroga- 
torily called at the time, offering mere resemblances of his sitters 
and their expensive accoutrements? Is this painting just a means 
to replicate the likeness of an individual in an era before the 
advent of photography? The answer to both questions is a 


resounding “no.” Copleys job was not just to make a faithful 
image of Mrs. Scott, but to portray her as a woman of impeccable 
character, limitless wealth, and aristocratic status. The flowers she 
holds are a symbol of fertility faithfulness, and feminine grace, 
indicating that she is a good mother and wife, and a charming 
woman. Her expensive dress was imported from London, as was 
her necklace. Copley undoubtedly copied her pose from one of 
the prints he had of portraits of British or French royalty 

Not only is Mrs. Scotts pose borrowed, but most likely her 
clothing is as well, for her necklace appears on three other women 
in Copley portraits. In other words, it was a studio prop, as the 
dress may have been too. In fact, except for Mrs. Scotts face, the 
entire painting is a fiction designed to aggrandize the wife of a 
newly wealthy Boston merchant who had made his fortune selling 
provisions to the occupying British army. The Scotts were nouveau- 
riche commoners, not titled aristocrats. By the middle of the eigh¬ 
teenth century rich Bostonians wanted to distinguish themselves 
from the multitude, and so, after a century of trying to escape their 
British roots, from which many had fled to secure religious free¬ 
dom, they now sought to imitate the British aristocracy, even to the 
point of taking tea in the afternoon and owning English Spaniels, 
a breed that in England only aristocrats were permitted to own. 

Joseph Scott commissioned this painting of his wife, as well as 
a portrait of himself, not just to record their features, but to show 
off the family’s wealth. The pictures were extremely expensive 
and therefore status symbols, much as a Rolls-Royce or a Tiffany 
diamond ring are today The portraits were displayed in the 


XXII INTRODUCTION 



public spaces of their house so that they could be readily seen by 
visitors. Most likely they hung on either side of the mantel in the 
living room, or in the entrance hall. They were not intended as 
intimate affectionate resemblances destined for the bedroom. If 
patrons wanted cherished images of their loved ones, they would 
commission miniature portraits, which captured the likeness of 
the sitter in amazing detail and were often so small they could be 
encased in a locket that a woman would wear on a chain around 
her neck, or a gentleman would place in the inner breastpocket of 
his coat, close to the heart. 

Warhol and Copley worked in very different times, a fact that 
has tremendous effect on the look and meaning of their portraits. 
Their paintings were made to serve very different purposes, and 
consequently they tell very different stories. And because art always 
serves a purpose, it is impossible for an artist to make a work that 
does not represent a point of view and tell a story, sometimes 
many stories. As we will see, great artists tell great and powerful 
stories. We shall find that an important key to unraveling these 
stories is understanding the context in which the work was made. 


THE POWER OF ART AND 
THE IMPACT OF CONTEXT 

In a sense, art is a form of propaganda, for it represents an indi¬ 
vidual s or groups point of view, and this view is often presented 
as truth or fact. For centuries, art was used by church and state to 
propagate their importance, superiority, and greatness. The Alba 
Madonna (fig. 1.3), for example, was designed to proclaim the 
idealized, perfect state of existence attainable through 
Catholicism in sixteenth-century Italy, while the Arch of Titus 
(fig. 1.4) was erected to reinforce in the public s mind the military 
prowess of the first-century Roman emperor. Even landscape

paintings and still lifes of fruit, dead game, and flowers made in 
the seventeenth century are loaded with moral messages, and are 
far from simple attempts to capture the splendor and many moods 
of nature or show off the painter s finesse at creating a convincing 
illusionistic image. 

Epitomizing the power of art is its ability to evoke entire 
historical periods. The words “ancient Egypt” will conjure up in 
most people s minds images of the pyramids, the Sphinx, and flat 
stiff figures lined up sideways across the face of stone (fig. 1.5).

American Gothic (fig. 1.6), which has led us to believe that humor¬ 
less, austere, hardworking farmers dominated the American 
hinterlands at the time. The painting has virtually become an 
emblem of rural America for the period. 

American Gothic has also become a source of much sarcastic 
humor for later generations, which have adapted the famous 
pitchfork-bearing farmer and his sour-faced daughter for all kinds 
of agendas unrelated to the artist s original message. Works of art 
are often later appropriated to serve purposes quite different from 
those initially intended, with context heavily influencing the 
meaning of a work. The reaction of some New Yorkers to The 
Holy Virgin Mary (fig. 1.7) by Chris Ofili reflects the power of art 
to provoke and spark debate, even outrage. The work appeared in 
an exhibition titled Sensation: Young British Artists from the 
Saatchi Collection , presented at the Brooklyn Museum in late 
1999. Ofili, who is a Briton of African descent, made an enormous 
picture of a black Virgin Mary using tiny dots of paint, glitter, map 
pins, and collaged images of genitalia from popular magazines. 
Instead of hanging on the wall, this enormous painting rested on 
two large wads of elephant dung, which had been a signature 
feature of the artists large canvases since 1991. Elephant dung is 
held sacred in some African cultures, and for Ofili, a devout 
Catholic who periodically attends Mass, the picture was a 
modernization of the traditional presentation of the elemental 
sacredness of the Virgin, with the so-called pornographic images 
intended to suggest both procreation and hovering naked angels. 
While intentionally provocative, the picture was not conceived as 
an attack on the Catholic religion. 


Many art historians, critics, and other viewers found the 
picture remarkably beautiful—glittering and shimmering with a 
delicate, ephemeral otherworldy aura. Many, especially Catholics, 
however, were repulsed by Ofili s homage to the Virgin and were 
infuriated. Instead of viewing the work through Ofili s eyes, they 
placed the painting within the context of their own experience and 
beliefs. Consequently, they interpreted the dung and graphic 
imagery—and perhaps even the black Virgin, although this was 
never mentioned—as sacrilegious. Within days of the opening of 
the exhibition, the painting had to be placed behind a large 
Plexiglas barrier. One artist hurled horse manure at the facade of 
the Brooklyn Museum, claiming, “I was expressing myself 
creatively,” a defense often offered for Ofili. Another museum 
visitor sneaked behind the Plexiglas barrier and smeared the 
Virgin with white paint in order to cover her up. The biggest 
attack came from New Yorks mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, a 
Catholic, who was so outraged that he tried, unsuccessfully, to 
stop city funding for the museum. The public outrage at Ofili s 
work is just part of a long tradition that probably goes back to the 
beginning of image making. Art has consistently provoked anger, 
just as it has inspired pride, admiration, love, and respect, and the 
reason is simple: Art is never an empty container but rather a 
vessel loaded with meaning, subject to multiple interpretations, 
and always representing someone’s point of view.

XXIV INTRODUCTION 







Because the context for looking at art constantly changes, our 
interpretations and insights into art and entire periods evolve as 
well. For example, when the first edition of this book was 
published in 1962, women artists were not included, which was 
typical for textbooks at the time. America, like most of the world, 
was male-dominated and history was male-centric. Historically, 
women were expected to be wives and mothers, and to stay in the 
home and not have careers. They were not supposed to become 
artists, and the few known exceptions were not taken seriously by 
historians, who were mostly male. The feminist movement, 
beginning in the mid-1960s, overturned this restrictive perception 
of women. As a result, in the last 40 years, art historians—many 
of them female—have “rediscovered” countless women artists who 
had attained a degree of success in their day. Many of them were 
outstanding artists, held in high esteem during their lifetimes, 
despite the enormous struggle to overcome powerful social and 
even family resistance against women becoming professional artists. 

One of these “lost” women artists is the seventeenth-century 
Dutch painter Judith Leyster, a follower, if not a student, of the 
famed Frans Hals. Over the subsequent centuries, Leysters 
paintings were either attributed to other artists, including 
Hals and Gerrit van Honthorst, or they were labeled “artist 
unknown.” At the end of the nineteenth century, however, 
Leyster was rediscovered in her own right through an analysis 
of her signature, documents, and style, and her paintings were 
gradually restored to her name. It was only with the feminist 
movement that she was elevated from a minor figure to one of the 
more accomplished painters of her generation, one important 
enough to be included in basic histories of art. The feminist move¬ 
ment provided a new context for evaluating art, one that had an 
interest in rather than a denial of womens achievements and a 
study of issues relating to gender and how they appear in the arts. 

A work like Leysters Self-Portrait (fig. 1.8) is especially 
fascinating from this point of view. Its size and date (ca. 1633) 
suggest that this may have been the painting the artist submitted 
as her presentation piece for admission into the local painters’ 
guild, the Guild of St. Luke of Haarlem. Women were not 
generally encouraged to join the guild, which was a male preserve 
that reinforced the professional status of men. Nor did women 
artists generally take on students. Leyster bucked both traditions, 
however, as she carved out a career for herself in a man’s world. In 
her self-portrait, she presents herself as an artist armed with many 
brushes, suggesting her deft control of the medium—an idea that 
the presentation picture itself was meant to demonstrate. On the 
easel is a segment of a genre scene of which several variations are 
known. We must remember that at this time artists rarely showed 
themselves working at their easels, toiling with their hands: They 
wanted to separate themselves from mere artisans and laborers, 
presenting themselves as intellectuals belonging to a higher class. 
As a woman defying male expectations, however, Leyster needed 
to declare clearly that she was indeed an artist. But she cleverly 
elevates her status by not dressing as an artist would when 
painting. Instead, she appears as her patrons do in their portraits, 
well-dressed and well-off. Her mouth is open, in what is called a

“speaking likeness” portrait, giving her a casual but self-assured 
animated quality, as she appears to converse on equal terms with 
a visitor, or with us. Leyster, along with Artemisia Gentileschi 
and Marie-Louise-Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun, who also appear in 
this book, was included in a major 1976 exhibition titled Women 
Artists 1550-1950 , which was shown in Los Angeles and 
Brooklyn, and played a major role in establishing the importance 
of women artists. 

WHAT IS ART? 

Ask most people “What is art?,” and they will respond with the 
words “an oil painting” or “a marble or bronze sculpture.” Their 
principal criterion is that the object be beautiful—whatever that 
may be—although generally they will probably define this as the 
degree to which a painting or sculpture is real looking or adheres 
to their notion of naturalism. Technical finesse or craft is viewed 
as the highest attribute of art making, capable of inspiring awe and 
reverence. Epitomizing these values is Greek and Roman sculp¬ 
ture, such as the fourth-century BCE sculpture the Apoxyomenos 
(Scraper) (fig. 1.9), which for centuries was considered the high 
point of fine art. To debunk the myth that art is only about tech¬ 
nique and begin to get at what it is really about, we return to 
Warhol s Gold Marilyn Monroe. The painting is rich with stories, 
one of which is how it poses questions about the meaning of art, 


INTRODUCTION XXV 



how it functions, and how it takes on value, both financial and 
aesthetic. Warhol even begs the question of the significance of 
technical finesse in art making, an issue raised by the fact that he 
wants to give us the impression that he may not have even 
touched this painting himself. We have already seen how he 
appropriated someone elses photograph of Monroe, not even 
taking his own. Warhol then instructed his assistants to make the 
screens for the printing process. They may also have prepared the 
canvas, screened the image with the colors Warhol selected, and 
even painted the gold to Warhol s specifications. 

By using assistants to make his work, Warhol is telling us that 
art is not necessarily about the artist s technical finesse, but about 
communicating an idea using visual language. The measuring stick 
for quality in art is the quality of the statement being made, or its 
philosophy, as well as the quality of the technical means for 
making this statement, even if not executed by the artist. Looking 
at Gold Marilyn Monroe in the flesh at New Yorks Museum 
of Modern Art is a powerful, even unforgettable experience. 
Standing in front of this large canvas, we cannot help but feel the

empty glory of America s most famous symbol of female sexual¬ 
ity and stardom. Because the artist s vision, and not his touch, is 
the relevant issue for the production of this particular work, it is 
of no consequence that Warhol makes it seem as though he never 
laid a hand on the canvas except to sign the back. We shall see 
shortly, however, that the artist s touch is indeed often critical to 
the success of a work of art, which is especially true for art made 
before 1900. 

Warhol openly declared that his art was not about his techni¬ 
cal ability when he named his midtown Manhattan studio “The 
Factory. ” By doing so, he told us that art was a commodity, and 
that he was manufacturing a product, even a mass-produced one. 
The factory churned out over a thousand paintings and prints of 
Marilyn based on the same publicity still. All Warhol appeared 
to do for the most part was sign them, his signature reinforcing 
the importance people placed on the idea of the artist s signature 
itself being an essential part of the work. Ironically, most Old 
Master paintings, dating from the fourteenth through the 
eighteenth centuries, are not signed; and despite giving the public 
the impression that he had little involvement in his work, Warhol 
was a workaholic and very hands-on in the production of his art. 

Moreover, artists have been using assistants to help make their 
pictures for centuries. Peter Paul Rubens, an Antwerp painter 
working in the first half of the seventeenth century and one of the 
most famous artists of his day, had an enormous workshop that 
cranked out many of his paintings, especially the larger works. 
His assistants often specialized in particular elements such as 
flowers, animals, or clothing, for example, and many went on to 
become successful artists in their own right. Rubens would design 
the painting, and then assistants, trained in his style, would 
execute individual parts. Rubens would then come in at the end 
and pull the painting together as needed. The price the client was 
willing to pay often determined how much Rubens himself par¬ 
ticipated in the actual painting of the picture: Many of his works 
were indeed made entirely by him, and therefore commanded the 
highest prices. Rubens s brilliant flashy brushwork was in many 
respects critical to the making of the picture. Not only was his 
handling of paint considered superior to that of his assistants, the 
very identity of his paintings—their very life, so to speak—was 
linked to his unique genius in applying paint to canvas, almost as 
much as it was to the dynamism of his dramatic compositions. 
His brushwork complemented his subject matter. The two went 
hand in hand. 

Warhol was not the first artist to make art that intentionally 
raised the issue of what art is and how it functions. This distinc¬ 
tion belongs to the humorous and brilliant Parisian Marcel 
Duchamp, one of the most influential artists of the twentieth 
century. In 1919, Duchamp took a postcard reproduction of 
Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa , which hangs in the Louvre 
Museum in Paris, and drew a moustache on the sitter s face (fig. 
1.10). Below he wrote the letters, “L.H.O.O.Q.,” which when 
pronounced in French is elle a chaud an cul , or “Shes got the 
hots.” Duchamp was poking fun at the publics fascination with 
the mysterious smile on the Mona Lisa, which had intrigued

viewers for centuries and eluded suitable explanation. Duchamp 
irreverently provided one: She is sexually aroused. With the child¬ 
ish gesture of affixing a moustache to the image, Duchamp also 
attacked bourgeois reverence for Old Master painting, as well as 
the age-old ideal of oil painting representing the pinnacle of art. 

Art, Duchamp is saying, can be made by merely drawing on a 
mass-produced reproduction. Artists can use any imaginable 
medium in any way in order to express themselves: not just oil 
on canvas or cast bronze or chiseled marble sculpture He is 
announcing that art is about ideas that are made visually, and not 
necessarily about craft. In this deceptively whimsical work, which 
is actually rich in ideas, Duchamp is telling us that art is anything 
someone wants to call art—which is not the same as saying it is 
good art. Furthermore, he is proclaiming that art can be small, 
since Mona Lisa (L.H.O.O.Q.) is a fraction of the size of its 
source, the Mona Lisa. By appropriating Leonardo s famous pic¬ 
ture and interpreting it very differently from traditional readings 
(see pages 564-66), Duchamp suggests that the meaning of art is 
not fixed forever by the artist, that it can change and be reassigned 
by viewers, writers, collectors, and museum curators, who may 
use it for their own purposes. Lastly, and this is certainly one of 
Duchamp s many wonderful contributions to art, he is telling us 
that art can be fun, that it can defy conventional notions of beauty, 


and while intellectually engaging us in a most serious manner, it 
can also provide us with a smile, if not a good belly laugh. Many 
historians today consider Mona Lisa (L.H.O .O .Q) as important 
as Leonardo s Mona Lisa , and put the two artists on the same 
plane of importance. 

ART AND AESTHETICS: THE ISSUE 
OF BEAUTY 

Mona Lisa (L.H.O.O.Q.) also raised the issue of aesthetics, which 
is the study of theories surrounding art, including the definition of 
beauty and the meaning and purpose of art. Duchamp selected the 
Mona Lisa for appropriation for many reasons, one of them no 
doubt being that many people considered it the greatest and there¬ 
fore the most beautiful painting ever made. Certainly, it was one 
of the most famous paintings in the world, if not the most famous. 
In 1919, most of those who held such a view had probably never 
seen it and only knew if from reproductions, probably no better 
than the one Duchamp used in Mona Lisa (L.H.O.O.Q.). And 
yet, they would describe the original painting as beautiful, but not 
Duchamp s comical version. 

Duchamp called altered found objects such as Mona Lisa 
(L.H.O.O.Q.) “readymades” (for other examples, see Bicycle 
Wheel , fig. 27.29, and Fountain , fig. 28.2), and he was adamant that 
these works had no aesthetic value whatsoever. They were not to 
be considered beautiful; they were aesthetically neutral. What 
interested Duchamp were the ideas that these objects embodied 
once they were declared art. 

Despite his claim, Duchamp s readymades can be perceived as 
beautiful, in ways, of course that are quite different from 
Leonardos Mona Lisa , but beautiful all the same. Mona Lisa 
(L.H.O.O.Q.) has an aura about it, an aura of wit and ideas that 
are specific to Duchamp. As a result, this slightly altered cheap 
color postcard is a compelling work of art. The qualities that 
attract us to it, which we can describe as its beauty could not be 
further from those of Leonardo s Mona Lisa , which have more to 
do with composition, color, and paint handling. Ultimately 
beauty in many respects, can be equated with quality, which to a 
large degree hinges on the power of the statement, not some 
pre-conceived notion of visual beauty 

Beauty is not just a pretty colorful picture or a perfectly 
formed, harmonious nude marble figure such as the Apoxymenos. 
Beauty resides as well in content and how successfully this con¬ 
tent is made visual. This book is intended to suggest the many 
complex ways that quality, and thus beauty manifests itself in art. 
Some of the greatest paintings are grotesque, depicting horrific 
scenes that many people do not find acceptable, but they are 
nonetheless beautiful—scenes such as beheadings, crucifixions 
(fig. 1.11), death and despair, emotional distress, and the brutal 
massacre of innocent women and children. Like Duchamp s Mona 
Lisa (L.H.O.O.Q.\ these works possess an aura that makes them 
riveting, despite the repulsiveness of their subject matter. They 
have quality, and to those who recognize and feel this quality, this

makes them beautiful. Others will continue to be repulsed and 
offended by them, or at best fail to find them interesting. 

ILLUSIONISM AND MEANING IN ART 

The Roman historian Pliny tells the story about the competition 
between the Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius to see who 
could make the most realistic work. Zeuxis painted grapes so real 
that birds tried to eat them. But it was Parrhasius who won the 
competition when he made a painting of a curtain covering a 
painting. So realistic was the work that Zeuxis asked him to pull 
back the curtain covering his painting only to discover that he was 
already looking at the painting. 

Pliny s story is interesting, because despite a recurring empha¬ 
sis on illusionism in art, the ability to create illusionistic effects 
and “fool the eye” is generally not what determines quality in art, 
and if it were, thousands of relatively unknown artists today 
would be considered geniuses. As we just discussed, quality in art 
comes from ideas and execution. Just being clever and fooling the 
eye is not enough. 

A look at the sculpture of twentieth-century artist Duane 
Hanson shows us how illusionism can be put in the service of 
meaning to create a powerful work of art. Hanson s 1995 sculpture 
Man on a Mower (fig. 1.12) is a work that is too often appreciated 
only for its illusionistic qualities, while the real content goes 
unnoticed. Yet, it is the content, not the illusionism itself, that 
makes this sculpture so powerful. Hanson began making his 
sculptures in the late 1960s, casting his figures in polyester resin, 
and then meticulously painting them. He then dressed them in 


real clothing, used real accessories (including wigs and artificial 
eyeballs), and placed them with real bits of furniture. Most viewers 
are startled to discover his sculptures are not real people, and many 
have tried to interact with his characters, which include museum 
guards, tourists, shoppers, house painters, and sunbathers. 

But Hanson s art is about more than just a visual sleight of 
hand. He is also a realist and a moralist, and his art is filled with 
tragic social commentary By “realist,” we mean that his sculpture 
is not limited to attractive, beautiful, and ennobling people, 
objects, and situations, but instead focuses on the base, crude, and 
unseemly. In Man on a Mower , which, with the exception of the 
lawnmower and aluminum can, is painted cast bronze, we see an 
overweight man clutching a diet soda. He dwarfs the riding 
mower he sits on. His T-shirt, baseball hat, pants, and sneakers are 
soiled. He is ordinary, and the entire sculpture is remarkably prosaic. 

Man on a Mower is a tragic work. We see disillusionment in the 
mans eyes as he blankly stares off into space. The diet soda he 
holds suggests that he is trying to lose weight but is losing the bat¬ 
tle. Cutting grass is another metaphor for a losing battle, since the 
grass is going to grow back. This work also represents the banality 
of human existence. What is life about? The monotony of cutting 
grass. In this last work, made when he knew he was dying of 
cancer, Hanson captured what he perceived to be the emptiness 
of human existence and contemporary life in the modern world. 
The illusionism of the sculpture makes this aura of alienation and 
lack of spirituality all the more palpable. This man is us, and this is 
our life, too. He embodies no poetry, nobility, or heroism. Our 
twentieth-century Man on a Mower has no fine causes or beliefs to 
run to as he confronts the down-to-earth reality of life and death.

XXVIII INTRODUCTION 








CAN A MECHANICAL PROCESS BE 
ART? PHOTOGRAPHY 


The first edition of this book did not include photography, 
reflecting on attitude dating back to the introduction of photog¬ 
raphy in 1839 that the medium, because it was largely a mechani¬ 
cal process, was not an art form, or certainly not one that had the 
same merit as painting and sculpture. Within the last 25 years, 
however, photography has been vindicated. Along with video and 
film, it has been elevated to the status of one of the most impor¬ 
tant artistic mediums, perhaps even outstripping painting. 
Pictures from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that had 
interested only a handful of photography insiders suddenly 
became intensely sought-after, with many museums rushing to 
establish photography departments and amass significant collec¬ 
tions. In other words, it took well over 125 years for people to 
understand photography and develop an eye for the special qual¬ 
ities and beauties of the medium, which are so radically different 
from those of the traditional twin peaks of the visual arts, paint¬ 
ing and sculpture. 

We need only look at a 1972 photograph titled Albuquerque 
(fig. 1.13) by Lee Friedlander to see how photography operates as 
an artistic medium. In his black-and-white print, called a gelatin 
silver print since the pre-exposed paper surface consists of silver 
in a gelatin solution, Friedlander portrays a modern America 
which, he suggests, has been rendered vacuous and lifeless by 
modernity and twentieth-century technology. How does he make 
such a statement? The picture obviously has a haunting empti¬ 
ness, for it contains no people and is instead filled with strange 
vacant spaces of walkway and street that appear between the 
numerous objects, such as a fire hydrant, street signs, and traffic 
light, that pop up everywhere. A hard, eerie geometry prevails, as 
seen in the strong verticals of poles, buildings, and wall. 
Cylinders, rectangles, and circles can be found throughout the 
composition, even in the background apartment building and the 
brick driveway in the foreground. 

Despite the stillness and sense of absence, the picture is busy 
and restless. The vertical elements create a vibrant staccato 
rhythm, which is reinforced by the asymmetrical composition 
lacking a focus or center, and by the powerful intersecting 
diagonals of the street and foreground wall. Friedlander crafted 
his composition so carefully he gets the shadow of the hydrant to 
parallel the street. Disturbing features appear everywhere. There 
is a lopsided telephone pole, suggesting collapse. And there is the 
pole for a street sign, the top of which has been cropped, that 
visually cuts a dog in two while casting a mysterious shadow on a 
nearby wall. The fire hydrant appears to be mounted incorrectly, 
sticking too far out of the ground. The car on the right has been 
brutally cropped and appears to have a light pole sprouting from 
its hood. The entire picture is dominated by technology and syn¬ 
thetic, industrial, or mass-produced objects. Nature has been 
cemented over, reduced to a few straggly trees in the middle 
ground and distance and the thriving weeds surrounding the 



1.13 Lee Friedlander, Albuquerque. 1972. Gelatin silver print, 

11 xl4" (27.9 x 35.6 cm) 

hydrant. In this brilliant print, Friedlander powerfully suggests 
that technology, mass-produced products, and a fast fragmented 
lifestyle are spawning alienation and a disconnection with nature. 
Friedlander also suggests that modernization is also making 
America homogeneous—if it were not for the title, we would 
have no idea that this photograph was taken in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico. 

Friedlander did not just find this composition. He very care¬ 
fully made it. He not only wanted a certainly quality of light for 
his picture, but probably even waited for the sun to cast shadows 
that aligned perfectly with the street. When framing the composi¬ 
tion, he meticulously incorporated a fragment of the utility cover 
in the lower left foreground, while axing a portion of the car on 
the right. Nor did the geometry of the picture just happen. He 
made it happen. Instead of a soft focus that would create an 
atmospheric blurry picture, he used a deep focus that produces a 
sharp crisp image filled with detail, allowing, for example, the 
individual rectangular bricks in the pavement to be clearly seen. 
The strong white tones of the vertical rectangles of the apartment 
building, the foreground wall, and the utility box blocking the car 
on the left edge of the picture were most likely carefully worked 
up in the darkroom, as was the rectangular columned doorway on 
the house. Friedlander has exposed the ugliness of modern 
America in this hard, cold, dry image, and because of the power 
of its message has made an extraordinarily beautiful work of art, 
the kind of image that has elevated photography into the pan¬ 
theon of art. 

HOW ARCHITECTURE TELLS STORIES 

An art form that is basically abstract and functional might be seen 
as a poor candidate for telling stories, conveying messages, and 
disseminating propaganda. And yet it can. We see Gianlorenzo 
Bernini doing it in 1657 when he was asked by Pope Alexander 
XVII to design a large open space, or piazza, in front of St. Peter s 


INTRODUCTION XXIX 











Cathedral in Rome. Bernini s solution was to create a plaza that 
was defined by a colonnade, or row of columns, resembling arms 
that appear to embrace visitors maternally, welcoming them into 
the bosom of the church (fig. LI 4). He thus anthropomorphized 
the building by emphasizing the identification of the church with 
the Virgin Mary. At the same time, the French architect Claude 
Perrault was commissioned to design the facade of Louis XIV s 
palace, the Louvre in Paris (fig. LI5). To proclaim the kings 
grandeur, he made the ground floor, where the day-to-day busi¬ 
ness of the court was carried out, a squat podium. In contrast, the 
second floor, where the royal quarters were located and Louis 
would have held court, was much higher and grander and served 
as the main floor, clearly supported by the worker-bee floor. 
Perrault articulated this elevated second story with a design that 
recalled Roman temples, thus associating Louis XIV with impe¬ 
rial Rome and worldly power. The severe geometry and symme¬ 
try of the building reflect the regimented order and tight control 
of Louis XIV s reign. 

At first glance, it seems hard to project any story onto Frank 
Lloyd Wrights Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (fig. 1.16), a 
museum that, when it was built between 1956 and 1959, was 
largely dedicated to abstract art. Located on upper Fifth Avenue 
in New York and overlooking Central Park, the building resem¬ 
bled for many a flying saucer; it was certainly radically different 
from the surrounding residential apartment buildings, and for 
that matter, almost anything built anywhere up to that time. But 
if we had to guess, we would probably first divine that the build¬ 
ing might be a museum, for the exterior resembles a work of art— 
a giant nonobjective sculpture. Made of reinforced concrete, the 
building even seems as though it were made from an enormous 
mold that formed its continuous upward spiral, which from any 
one side appears to consist of enormous, weighty, massive hori¬ 
zontal bands. There is no mistaking this structure for an apart¬ 
ment complex or office building. 

Wright conceived the Guggenheim in 1945-46, when he 
received the commission, and his personal goal was to create an 
organic structure that deviated from the conventional static rec¬ 
tangular box filled with conventional rectangular rooms. The 
building is designed around a spiral ramp (fig. 1.17), which is 
meant to evoke a spiral shell, and this ramp is what defines the 
design of the exterior. Wright also thought of the interior as a 
ceramic vase, for it is closed at the bottom, widens as it rises, and 
is “open” at the top since it is capped by a spectacular light-filled, 
cone-shaped glass roof. Essentially, the museum is a single ramp- 
lined space, although there are a handful of galleries off the ramp 
and separate spaces for offices, auditorium, and bookstore, for 
example. Wright expected visitors to take an elevator to the top of 
the ramp, and then slowly amble down its 3 percent gradient, 
gently pulled along by gravity. Because the ramp was relatively 
narrow, viewers could not stand too far back from the art, which 
seemed to float on the curved walls, enhancing the fluid effect of 
Wright s curved, organic design. As a result, visitors were forced 
into a more intimate relationship with the art. At the same time, 
however, they could look back across the open space of the room 


to see where they had gone, comparing the work in front of them 
to a segment of the exhibition presented on a sweeping distant arc, 
Or they could look ahead as well, to get a preview of where they 
were going. 

Not only do visitors see the art, they also see other visitors, 
sometimes just as distant specks, winding their way down the 
ramp. The building has a sense of continuity and mobility that 
Wright viewed as an organic experience, analogous to traveling 
along the continuous winding paths of the adjacent Central Park, 
which was designed in the nineteenth century to capture and 
preserve nature in the encroaching urban environment. Wright s 
enormous “room” reflects nature not only in its spiral shell 
design, but also in the organic concave and convex forms that can 
be seen from the top of ramp and that reflect the subtle eternal 
movement of nature. Wright even placed a lozenge-shaped pool 
on the ground floor, directly opposite the light entering from the 
skylight above, the two architectural touches reinforcing a sense 
of nature. Art historians have also likened the sense of constant

movement in Wrights seemingly endless ramp—which most 
people now ascend rather than descend because exhibitions begin 
at the foot of the ramp—to the American frontier, the ramp 
embodying “the expansive, directionless response of the fron¬ 
tiersman to limitless space,” as expressed by James Fenimore 
Cooper s Natty Bumppo, Fierman Melville s whaling chase, Mark 
Twain s Mississippi, and Walt Whitman s Open Road. Far-fetched 
as this may sound, we must remember that Wright was born in 
the Midwest in the nineteenth century, when it was still rural, and 
beginning with his earliest mature buildings, his designs, such as 
the Robie Fiouse (see fig. 26.39), were meant to capture the vast 
spread of the plains and were carefully integrated into the land. 

If Wrights austere, abstract sculptural design for both the 
exterior and interior undermines his attempt to evoke nature, 
the building still retains a sense of open space and continuous 


movement. Unlike any other museum, the Guggenheim has a 
sense of communal spirit, for here everyone is united in one large 
room and traveling the same path. 

EXPERIENCING ART 

You will be astonished when you see first-hand much of the art in 
this book. No matter how accurate the reproductions here, or in 
any other text, they are no more than stand-ins for the actual 
objects. We hope you will visit some of the museums where the 
originals are displayed. But keep in mind that looking at art, 
absorbing its full impact, takes time and repeated visits. In many 
respects, looking at art is no different than reading a book or 
watching a film—it requires extensive, detailed looking, a careful 
reading of the image or object, perhaps even a questioning of why 
every motif, mark, or color is used. Ideally, the museum will help 
you understand the art. Often, there are introductory text panels 
that tell you why the art has been presented as it is and what it is 
about, and ideally there will be labels for individual works that 
provide further information. Major temporary exhibitions gener¬ 
ally have a catalog, which adds further information and some¬ 
times another layer of interpretation. But text panels, labels, and 
catalogues generally reflect one person s reading of the art: Keep 
in mind there are usually many other ways to approach or think 
about it. 

Art museums are relatively new. Before the nineteenth century 
art was not made to be viewed in museums, so when you are look¬ 
ing at work in a museum, you are often viewing it out of the 
original context in which it was meant to be seen. Much work can 
still be seen in its original context—churches, cathedrals, 
chateaux, public piazzas, and archaeological sites. Ultimately, 
however, art can be found everywhere—in commercial galleries, 
corporate lobbies and offices, places of worship, and private 
homes. It is displayed in public spaces, from subway stations and 
bus stops to public plazas and civic buildings such as libraries, 
performing arts centers, and city halls. University and college 
buildings are often filled with art, and the buildings themselves 
are art. The chair you are sitting in and the house or building you 
are reading this book in are also works of art—maybe not great 
art, but art all the same, as Duchamp explained. Even the clothing 
you are wearing is in a sense art, and for you it is a way to make 
a personal statement. Everywhere you find art, it is telling you 
something, and supporting a point of view. 

Art is not a luxury, as many people would have us believe, but 
an integral part of daily life. It has a major impact on us, even 
when we are not aware of it, for we feel better about ourselves 
when we are in environments that are visually enriching and excit¬ 
ing. Most important, art stimulates us to think. Even when it 
provokes and outrages us, it broadens our experience by making 
us question our values, attitudes, and worldview This book is an 
introduction to this fascinating field that is so intertwined with 
our lives. After reading it, you will find that the world will no 
longer look the same. 


INTRODUCTION XXXI 










Prehistoric Art 



W HEN MODERN HUMANS FIRST ENCOUNTERED PREHISTORIC 

cave paintings in the 1870s, they literally could not believe their 
eyes. Although the evidence indicated that the site at Altamira in 
Spain dated to around 13,000 bce, the paintings had been executed 
with such skill and sensitivity that historians initially considered them forgeries 


(see fig 1.1). Since then, some 200 similar sites have been discov¬ 
ered all over the world. As recently as 1994, the discovery of a 
cave in southeastern France (see fig. 1.2) brought hundreds more 
paintings to light and pushed back the date of prehistoric painting 
even further, to approximately 30,000 bce. Carved objects have 
been discovered that are equally old. 

These earliest forms of art raise more questions than they 
answer: Why did prehistoric humans spend their time and energy 
making art? What functions did these visual representations 
serve? What do the images mean? Art historians often use con¬ 
temporaneous written texts to supplement their understandings 
of art; prehistoric art, however, dates to a time before writing, for 
which works of art are among our only evidence. Art historians 
therefore deploy scientific and anthropological methods in their 
attempts to interpret them. Archaeologists report new finds with 
regularity, so the study of prehistoric art continues to develop and 
refine its interpretations and conclusions. 

Fully modern humans have lived on the earth for over 100,000 
years. At first they crafted tools out of stone and fragments of 
bone. About 40,000 years ago, they also began to make detailed 
representations of forms found in nature. What inspired this 
change? Some scholars suppose that image making and symbolic 

Detail of figure 1.8, Hall of the Bulls , Lascaux Cave, Dordogne, France 


language are the result of the new structure of the brain associated 
with homo sapiens sapiens. Art emerges at about the time that fully 
modern humans moved out of Africa and into Europe, Asia, and 
Australia, encountering—and eventually displacing—the earlier 
Neanderthals (homo neanderthalensis) of western Eurasia. On 
each of these continents, there is evidence of representational art¬ 
work or of body decoration contemporary with homo sapiens 
sapiens. Tens of thousands of works survive from this time before 
history, the bulk of which have been discovered in Europe. Many 
are breathtakingly accomplished. 

The skill with which the earliest datable objects are executed 
may have been the product of a lengthy and lost period of experi¬ 
mentation in the techniques of carving and painting, so the 
practice of art making may be much older than the surviving 
objects. All the same, some scholars argue that a neurological 
mutation related to the structure of the brain opened up the 
capacity for abstract thought, and that symbolic language and 
representational art were a sudden development in human evolu¬ 
tion. Whatever led to the ability to create art, whether a gradual 
evolutionary process, or a sudden mutation, it had an enormous 
impact on the emergence of human culture, including the making 
of naturalistic images. Such works force us to reevaluate many of 
our assumptions about art and the creative process, and raise fun¬ 
damental questions, not least of which is why human beings make 
art at all.

PREHISTORIC ART

CHAPTER 




PALEOLITHIC ART 

Upper Paleolithic painting, drawing, and sculpture appeared over 
a wide swath of Eurasia, Africa, and Australia at roughly the same 
time, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago (map 1.1 and 
Informing Art , page 9). This time span falls in the Pleistocene era, 
more commonly known as the Ice Age, when glaciers (the 
extended polar ice caps) covered much of the northern hemi¬ 
sphere. The Lower and Middle Paleolithic periods extend back as 
far as 2 million years ago, when earlier species of the homo genera 
lived. These cultures crafted stone tools, which they sometimes 
decorated with abstract patterns. The end of the most recent Ice 
Age corresponded with the movement of fully modern humans 
out of Africa and into Europe, newly habitable as the warming 
climate caused the glaciers to recede. 


Prehistoric paintings first came to light in 1878 in a cave 
named Altamira, in the village of Santillana del Mar in northern 
Spain. As Count Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola scoured the 
ground for flints and animal bones, his 12-year-old daughter, 
Maria, spied bison, painted in bold black outline and filled with 
bright earth colors (fig. 1 . 1 ), on the ceiling of the cave. There, and 
in other more recently discovered caves, painted and engraved 
images predominantly depict animals. The greatest variety known 
is in the vast cave complex of Chauvet, near Vallon-Pont-d’Arc in 
southeastern France, named after one of the spelunkers who dis¬ 
covered it in 1994. Here, the 427 animal representations found to 
date depict 17 species, including lions, bears, and aurochs (prehis¬ 
toric oxen), in black or red outlines (fig. 1 . 2 ), and are sometimes 
polychromatic (containing several colors). Abstract shapes may 
accompany the animals, or appear alone, such as those depicted

next to the Chinese Horse at Lascaux in the Dordogne region of 
France (fig. 1.3). Scholars have interpreted these as weapons, 
traps, and even insects. Human hands occasionally feature on the 
cave walls, stamped in paint or, more usually, in negative 


silhouette (see Materials and Techniques , page 5). In rare instances, 
images depict human or partly human forms. At Chauvet, for 
instance, archaeologists identified the lower half of a woman 
painted on a projection of rock. At Les Trois Freres, a site in the 
French Pyrenees, a human body depicted with its interior muscles 
and anatomy supports an animal head with antlers. At Lascaux, a 
male stick figure with a birdlike head lies between a woolly 
rhinoceros and a disemboweled bison, with a bird-headed stick or 
staff nearby (fig. 1.4). 

On first assessing the Altamira paintings toward the end of the 
nineteenth century, experts declared them too advanced to be 
authentic and dismissed them as a hoax. Indeed, though cave art 
may represent the dawn of art as we know it, it is often highly 
sophisticated. Like their counterparts at Chauvet and elsewhere, 
the bison of Altamira were painted from memory, yet their forms 
demonstrate the painters’ acute powers of observation and skill in 
translating memory into image. Standing at rest, or bellowing or 
rolling on the ground, the bison behave in these paintings as they 
do in the wild. The painters’ careful execution enhances the 
appearance of nature: Subtle shading (modeling) expresses the 
volume of a bison’s belly or a lioness’s head, and the forward con¬ 
tour of an animal’s far leg is often rendered with a lighter hue to 
suggest distance. 

Initially, scholars assigned relative dates to cave paintings by 
using stylistic analysis, dating them according to their degree of 
naturalism, that is, how closely the image resembled the subject

THE ANCIENT WORLD 





Cave Painting 

P aleolithic cave artists used a wide variety of techniques to achieve 
the images that have survived. Often working far from cave 
entrances, they illuminated the darkness using lamps carved out of 
stone and filled with fat or marrow. Archaeologists have found several 
of these lamps at Lascaux and elsewhere. Sometimes, when the area 
of rock to be painted was high above ground level, they may have built 
scaffolds of wood, which they stabilized against the wall by driving the 
poles into the limestone surface. 

They prepared the surface by scraping the limestone with stone 
tools, bringing out its chalky whiteness as a background. They then 
engraved some images onto the wall, with a finger if the limestone was 
soft enough, or with a sharp flint. Sometimes they combined this tech¬ 
nique with the application of color. They created black using vegetal 
charcoal and perhaps charred bones. Ocher, a natural iron ore, pro¬ 
vided a range of vivid reds, browns, and yellows. For drawing—out¬ 
lines of animals, for instance—they deployed charcoal and ocher in 
chunks, like a crayon; to generate paint, they ground the minerals into 
powder on a large flat stone. By heating them to extremely high tem¬ 
peratures, they could also vary the shades of red and yellow. They 
could then blow these mineral powders through tubes of animal bone 
or reed against a hand held up with fingers splayed to the rock surface 
to make hand silhouettes. 

To fill in animal or human outlines with paint, they mixed the pow¬ 
ders with blenders, which consisted of cave water, saliva, egg white, 
vegetal or animal fat, or blood; they then applied the colors to the 
limestone surface, using pads of moss or fur, and brushes made of 
fur, feather, or chewed stick. Some scholars understand, by experi¬ 
mentation, that pigment was often chewed up in the mouth and then 
blown or spat directly onto the walls to form images. In some cases, 
like the Spotted Horse of Pech-Merle or at Chauvet, artists applied 
paint in dots, leading to what some scholars describe as a “pointilliste” 
effect. They achieved this by covering the palm with ocher before

pressing it against the limestone. Analysis of these marks has yielded 
rich results: Not only can archaeologists identify individual artists by 
their handprint, but they have even been able to determine that 
women and adolescents were at work as well as men. 



in nature. As art historians at that time considered naturalism the 
most advanced form of representation, the more naturalistic the 
image, the more evolved and, therefore, the more recent it was 
considered to be. Radiocarbon dating has since exposed the flaws 
in this approach, however (see Informing Art , page 17). Judged to 
be more recent in the overall sequence on account of their 
remarkable naturalism, some of the paintings at Chauvet in fact 
proved to be among the earliest on record, dating to about 32,000 
years ago. It is thus a mistake to assume that naturalism was a 
Paleolithic artists—or any artists—inevitable or only goal. A 
consistent use of conventions in depicting individual species 
(bulls at Lascaux shown in profile but with frontal horns, for 
instance) defies nature; these are not optical images, showing an 
animal as one would actually see it, but composite ones, offering 
many of the details that go toward making up the animal por¬ 
trayed, though not necessarily in anatomically accurate positions. 
As the “stick man” at Lascaux may illustrate, artists may have 
judged their success by standards quite removed from naturalism. 


Interpreting Prehistoric Painting 

As majestic as these paintings can be, they are also profoundly 
enigmatic: What purpose did they serve? The simplest view, that 
they were merely decorative—“art for arts sake”—is highly 
unlikely. Most of the existing paintings and engravings are readily 
accessible, while many more that once embellished caves that 
open directly to the outside have probably perished. But some, at 
Lascaux and elsewhere, lie deep inside extended cave systems, 
remote from habitation areas and difficult to reach (fig. 1.5). In 
these cases, the power of the image may have resided in its mak¬ 
ing, rather than in its viewing: the act of painting or incising the 
image may have served some ritual or religious purpose. 

After the images’ initial discovery, scholars turned to 
approaches developed by ethnographers (anthropologists who 
study cultural behavior) to interpret cave paintings and engrav¬ 
ings. Most often, they have attributed the inspiration for these 
works to magico-religious motives. Thus, early humans may have 
perceived an image as equivalent to the animal it represented; to 


CHAPTER 1 PREHISTORIC ART 5 


MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 








create or possess the image was to exert power over its subject, 
which might improve the success of a hunt. Gouge marks on cave 
walls indicate that in some cases spears were cast at the images 
(fig. 1.6). Similarly, artists may have hoped to stimulate fertility in 
the wild—ensuring a continuous food supply—by depicting 
pregnant animals. A magico-religious interpretation might 
explain the choice to make animals appear lifelike, and to control 
them by fixing them within outlines; conversely, human fear of 
falling victim to the same magic may account for the decidedly 
unnaturalistic, abstract quality of the “stick figure” at Lascaux. 

More recent theories concerning shamanism—a belief in a 
parallel spirit world accessed through alternative states of con¬

sciousness—build upon the earlier ethnographic interpretations, 
arguing that an animals “spirit” was evident where a bulge in the 
wall or ceiling suggested its shape, as with the Spotted Horses (see 
fig. 1.6) at Pech-Merle in southwestern France. The artists or 
shaman s power brought that spirit to the surface. Some scholars 
have cast the paintings in a central role in early religion, as images 
for worship. Others focus on a painting s physical context—this 
means examining relationships between figures to determine, in 
the absence of an artificial frame, a ground-line or a landscape, 
whether multiple animal images indicate individual specimens or 
a herd, and whether these images represent a mythical past for 
early communities. Do Lascaux s Rhinoceros , Wounded Man , and 
Bison (see fig. 1.4) constitute separate images or the earliest known 
narrative—the gory tale of a hunt, perhaps, or a shamans 
encounter with his spirit creature? Multiple animal engravings, 
one on top of another, as at Les Trois Freres (fig. 1.7), may have 
recorded animal migrations throughout the passing seasons. 

Assessing physical context also means recognizing that a cave 
15 feet deep is a very different kind of space from another over a 
mile deep, and was possibly used for different purposes. Paintings 
in the spacious Hall of the Bulls at Lascaux and the stick man at 
the same site, located at the bottom of a 16-foot well shaft, may 
have functioned differently. It means factoring in the experiential 
aspects of caves: In order to reach these images, a prehistoric 
viewer had to contend with a precarious path, eerie flickering 
lights, echoing sounds, and the musty smells that permeate sub¬ 
terranean spaces, all of which added texture to the viewing 
process (fig. 1.8). Most important, recent interpretations 
acknowledge that one explanation may not suffice for all times 
and places. For instance, even if sympathetic magic makes sense of 
the Chinese Horse from Lascaux with its distended belly (see fig. 
1.3), it hardly explains the art at Chauvet, where fully 72 percent 
of the animals represented were not hunted, judging by organic 
remains found in the cave.

Paleolithic Carving 

Prehistoric artists also carved and modeled sculptures in a variety 
of materials. At just under a foot high, a carved figure from 
Fiohlenstein-Stadel in Germany (fig. 1.9) represents a standing 
creature, half human and half feline, crafted out of mammoth 
ivory. Although it is now in a poor state of preservation, the cre¬ 
ation of this figure, with rudimentary stone tools, was clearly an 
arduous business. It involved splitting the dried mammoth tusk, 
scraping it into shape, and using a sharp flint blade to incise such 
features as the striations on the arm and the muzzle. Strenuous 
polishing followed, using powdered hematite (an iron ore) as an 
abrasive. Exactly what the figure represents is unclear. Like the 
hybrid figures painted on cave walls (see fig. 1.4), it may represent 
a human dressed as an animal, possibly for hunting purposes. 
Some prehistorians have named these composite creatures 
shamans or “sorcerers,” who could contact the spirit world 
through ritualistic behavior. 

As in cave paintings, animals were frequent subjects for sculp¬ 
ture. A miniature horse from a cave in Vogelherd along the 
Danube River in Germany and a pair of interlocked ibexes, date

to the beginning and end of the Upper Paleolithic era (figs. 1.10 
and 1.11). The horse is one of many portable carvings in woolly 
mammoth ivory created around 28,000 bce. A small hole between 
its front legs suggests that it was a pendant. The ibexes, carved 
from reindeer antler around 13,000 bce, functioned as a spear- 
thrower. Once attached to a spear by the hook at the end of its 
shaft, it allowed a hunter to propel the weapon more effectively. 
The sculptor had an eye for strong outlines and finished the sur¬ 
face with painstaking care, marking the ibexes’ coats with nicks 
from a stone tool and working up a high polish. 

Just as cave artists sometimes transformed bulges in rock 
walls into painted animals, so, deep within a cave at Le Tuc 
d’Audoubert in the French Pyrenees, around 13,000 bce, a sculp¬ 
tor used clay to build up a natural outcropping of rock into two 
bison (fig. 1.12); a calf originally stood by the front legs of the

Telling Time: Labels and Periods 

W hile geologists have developed methods for dividing time based 
on the age of the Earth, historians have used the activity of tool¬ 
making as the defining feature when measuring human time. For the 
era before the written word (prehistory), patterns apparent in stone 
tools serve as the basis for distinguishing different cultures. The Stone 
Age stretches from about 2 million years ago to about 2000 bce. 

Prehistorians divide this broad span of time into the Paleolithic or 
Old Stone Age (from the Greek palaio-, meaning “ancient,” and lithos, 
meaning “stone”), the Mesolithic or Middle ( meso -) Stone Age, and the 
Neolithic or New ( neo -) Stone Age. The Paleolithic era reaches from 
2 million years ago to about 1 0,000 bce and the Mesolithic from about 
1 0,000 to 8000 bce. The Neolithic era spans from about 8000 to about 
2000 bce. At some time during the third millennium bce, humans in 
some parts of the world replaced stone tools with tools made of metal, 
ushering in the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia. 

Specific human cultures reached these phases at different times: 

The beginning of the Neolithic era appears to start earlier in western 
Asia than in Europe, for example. Yet the broad span of the Paleolithic 
era requires further refinement, and excavations of Paleolithic sites 
provide another framework for dividing time. The oldest material is at 
the bottom of an excavation, so scholars call the oldest Paleolithic era 
the Lower Paleolithic (ending about 1 00,000 years ago). The middle 
layers of Paleolithic excavations—thus the Middle Paleolithic era—date 
from 1 00,000 to about 40,000 years ago. The most recent layers in 


such excavations are called the Upper Paleolithic, and date from about 
40,000 to around 8000 bce. 

Archaeologists have used many sites and different types of tools 
and tool-making technologies to identify specific culture groups within 
the Upper Paleolithic period. For example, they name the Aurignacian 
culture for Aurignac, a site in western France. The objects from this 
culture date from about 34,000 to 23,000 bce. The Gravettian culture 
is named for La Gravette, a site in southwestern France, and dates 
from about 28,000 to 22,000 bce. The most recent of these cultures is 
the Magdalenian, named for a site in southwestern France called La 
Magdaleine, with dates ranging from around 1 8,000 to 1 0,000 bce. 
Many of these terms were coined in the nineteenth 
century, when the study of prehistoric culture first took root.

swell and taper to approximate the mass of a real bison. Despite 
the three-dimensional character of the representations (notice the 
fullness of the haunch and shoulder and the shaggy manes), 
the sculptures share conventions with cave paintings: The artist 
rendered them in fairly strict profile, so that they are viewable 
from one side only, but once again the function of the object is 
unclear to us. Among the human footprints found near this group 
are those of a two-year-old child. Along with the baby s hand¬ 
print in a cave at Bedeilhac in France, and the womens handprints 
at Chauvet, these caution us against simply reconstructing 
Paleolithic works of art as the ritual centerpieces of a male- 
dominated hunting society. 

Women were frequent subjects in prehistoric sculpture, espe¬ 
cially in the Gravettian period (see Informing Art , page 9). In fact, 
so far do female images outnumber male images at that time that 
they may be evidence of a matrilineal social structure. In the late 
nineteenth century a group of 12 ivory figurines were found 
together in the Grotte du Pape at Brassempouy in southern 
France. Among them was the Woman from Brassempouy (fig. 
1.13) of about 22,000 bce. The sculpture is almost complete, 
depicting a head and long elegant neck. At a mere D/inches long, 
it rests comfortably in the hand, where it may have been most 
commonly viewed. Also hand-sized is the limestone carving of 
the nude Woman ofWillendorf of Austria, from about 28,000 to 
25,000 bce (fig. 1.14). Discovered in 1908, her figure still bears 
traces of ocher rubbed onto the carved surface. Both figurines are 
highly abstract. Instead of rendering the female form with the 
naturalism found in the representations of animals, the artist 
reduced it to basic shapes. In the case of the Woman from 
Brassempouy , the artist rendered the hair schematically with deep 
vertical gouges and shallow horizontal cross-lines. There is no 
mouth and only the suggestion of a nose; hollowed-out, over¬ 
hanging eye sockets and holes cut on either side of the bridge of 
the nose evoke eyes. The quiet power and energy of the figure 
reside in the dramatic way its meticulously polished surface 
responds to shifting light, suggesting movement and life. 

The abstract quality of the Woman of Willendorf appears to 
stress a potent fertility. This kind of abstraction appears in many 
other figurines as well; indeed, some incomplete figurines depict 
only female genitalia. Facial features are not a priority: schemati¬ 
cally rendered hair covers the entire head. Emphasis rests on the 
figure’s reproductive qualities: Diminutive arms sit on pendulous 
breasts, whose rounded forms are echoed in the extended belly 
and copious buttocks. Genitalia are shown between large thighs. 

The terminology applied to figures like the Woman from 
Brassempouy and the Woman ofWillendorf in the past has com¬ 
plicated our interpretations of them. At the time of the first dis¬ 
covery of such female figurines in the mid-nineteenth century 
scholars named them “Venus” figures: Venus is the Roman goddess 
of love (Aphrodite in the Greek world), whom ancient sculptors 
portrayed as a nude female; nineteenth-century archaeologists 
believed the prehistoric figures to be similar to the Roman god¬ 
dess, in function if not in form. Today we tend to avoid such 
anachronisms in terminology We do not know whether the

Woman ofWillendorf represents a specific woman, or a generic or 
ideal woman. Indeed, she may not represent the idea of woman at 
all, but rather the notion of reproduction or, as some have argued, 
the fertile natural world itself. The emphasis on the reproductive 
features has suggested to many that she may have been a fertility 
object; the intention may have been to ensure a successful birth 
outcome rather than an increase in the number of pregnancies. 
According to one feminist view, the apparently distorted forms of 
figures like this specifically reflect a womans view of her own 
body as she looked down at it. If so, some of the figures may have 
served as obstetric aids, documenting different stages of preg¬ 
nancy to educate women toward healthy births. Moreover, this 
may indicate that at least some of the artists were women. 


Paleolithic Houses 

In the Paleolithic period, people generally built small huts and 
used caves for shelter and ritual purposes. In rare cases, traces of 
dwellings survive. At Mezhirich, in the Ukraine, a local farmer 



1.15 House at Mezhirich, Ukraine. 16,000-10,000 bce. 
Mammoth bone 


discovered a series of oval dwellings with central hearths, dating 
to between 16,000 and 10,000 bce (fig. 1.15). The distinctive fea¬ 
ture of these huts was that they were constructed out of mammoth 
bones: interlocked pelvis bones, jawbones and shoulder blades 
provided a framework, and tusks were set across the top. The 
inhabitants probably covered the frame with animal hides. 
Archaeological evidence shows that inside these huts they 
prepared foods, manufactured tools, and processed skins. Since 
these are cold-weather occupations, archaeologists conclude that 
the structures were seasonal residences for mobile groups, 
who returned to them for months at a time over the course of 
several years. 


NEOLITHIC ART 

Around 10,000 bce, the climate began to warm, and the ice that 
had covered almost a third of the globe started to recede, leaving 
Europe with more or less the geography it has today. New vege¬ 
tation and changing animal populations caused human habits to 
mutate, especially in relation to their environment. In the 
Neolithic period, or New Stone Age, they began to build more 
substantial structures, choosing fixed settlement places on the 
basis of favorable qualities such as a water supply, rather than 
moving seasonally. Instead of hunting and gathering what nature 
supplied, they domesticated animals and plants. This gradual 
change occurred at different moments across the world; in some 
places, hunting and gathering are still the way of life today. 


Settled Societies and Neolithic Art 

The earliest evidence of these adjustments to environmental 
shifts appears in the fertile regions of the eastern Mediterranean 
and Mesopotamia, between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. A 
small settlement developed in the ninth millennium bce by the 
Jordan River at the site of Jericho, of biblical fame, in the present 
West Bank territory. Over time its inhabitants built houses of

sun-baked mud brick on stone foundations. They plastered the 
floors and crafted roofs of branches and earth. Skeletal remains 
indicate that they buried the bodies of their dead beneath the 
floors; they displayed the skulls separately above ground, recon¬ 
structing them with tinted plaster to resemble flesh, and crafting 
eyes of seashell fragments (fig. 1.16). The subtlety of their model¬ 
ing, and the close observation of the interplay between flesh and 
bone, make these works remarkably lifelike, each as individual as 
the skulls they encased. Perhaps these funerary practices reflect a 
concept of an afterlife; at the very least, they suggest a respect for 
the dead or even ancestor worship. Around 7500 bce, the people 
of Jericho, now numbering over 2,000, dug a wide ditch and 
raised a solid stone wall around their town, which by this time 
had expanded to cover some 10 acres. Built with only the simplest 
stone tools, the wall was 5 feet thick and over 13 feet high. Into it 
they set a massive circular tower, perhaps one of several, 28 feet 
tall and 33 feet in diameter at the base, with a staircase inside pro¬ 
viding access to the summit (fig. 1.17). The wall may have func¬ 
tioned as a fortification system against neighboring settlements, 
or as a barrier against rising floodwaters. With its construction, 
monumental architecture was born.

THE ANCIENT WORLD 





At Ain Ghazal, near Amman in Jordan, over 30 fragmentary 
plaster figures, dating to the mid-seventh millennium bce, repre¬ 
sent a starkly different sculptural tradition from the Jericho heads 
(fig. 1.18). Some are only bust-size, but the tallest statues, when 
restored, are 3 feet in height, and constitute the first known large- 
scale sculptures. Conservators have studied the construction 
technique of these figures, and conclude that large size was the 
motivating force behind their design, directly resulting in their 
flat, shallow appearance. These investigations have shown that 
artists applied plaster to bundles of fresh reeds, bound with 
cordage, which they kept horizontal during the assembly process. 
They added the legs separately, then applied paint and added 
cowrie shells for eyes, darkened with bitumen (a black, tarlike 
substance) for pupils. Once the plaster was dry, they stood the 
fragile figures upright and probably added wigs and clothing. 
Like the Jericho heads, the figures may have represented ances¬ 
tors. Alternatively, as some of the bodies are two-headed, they 
may have had a mythical function.

1.19 Reconstruction of £atal Hiiyiik, Turkey 

QATAL HUYUK In Anatolia (modern Turkey), excavations 
since 1961 have revealed a Neolithic town at £atal Hiiyiik, dating 
from about 7500 bce, a thousand years later than Jericho (see map 
1.1). Flourishing through trade in ores—principally obsidian, a 
highly valued glasslike volcanic stone, used to make strong, sharp 
blades—the town developed rapidly through at least 12 successive 
building phases between 6500 and 5700 bce. Its most distinctive 
feature is that it lacked streets, and the mud-brick and timber 
houses had no doors at ground level: Each house stood side by 
side with the next, accessed by ladder through a hole in the roof 
that doubled as a smoke vent (fig. 1.19). The advantages of this 
design were structural—each house buttressing the next—and 
defensive, since any attacker would have to scale the outer walls 
before facing resistance on the rooftops. The design also made 
economic use of available building stone and provided thick- 
walled insulation. The rooms inside accommodated activities 
ranging from working and cooking to sleeping, on platforms 
lining the walls. As at Jericho, burials were beneath the floor. 

In most of the rooms at £atal Hiiyiik, plaster covered the 
walls; often it was painted. Many of the paintings depict animal 
hunts, with small human figures running around disproportion¬ 
ately large bulls or stags. The images have a static quality, quite

unlike the earlier cave paintings that seem to embody motion. 
One unusual painting in an early room appears to depict rows of 
irregular blocklike houses, and probably represents £atal Hiiyiik 
itself (fig. 1.20). Above the town, a bright red feature spotted with 
black and topped with black lines and dots may represent Hasan

Dag, a twin-peaked volcano in view of the town. If archaeologists 
have properly identified this site, the image is the first known 
landscape painting. It may indicate a sense of community in this 
early settlement, with inhabitants specifically identifying them¬ 
selves with place. Some archaeologists speculate that the more 
ornate rooms at (Jatal Hiiyiik functioned as shrines; in some of 
them, bulls 5 horns and plaster breasts may have signified fertility 
(fig. 1.21). 

OVEN-FI RED POTTERY A number of new technologies that 
developed during the Neolithic period collectively suggest the 
beginnings of specialization. As the community could count on a 
regular food supply, some of its members were able to devote time 
to acquiring special skills. These included pottery, weaving, and 
the smelting of copper and lead. Oven-fired pottery is extremely 
durable, and often survives in the form of discarded shards. 
Though absent from early Jericho, a great variety of clay vessels 
painted with abstract forms survive in regions stretching from 
Mesopotamia, where pottery may have originated in the sixth 
millennium bce, to Egypt and Anatolia, where it was discovered 
at (Jatal Hiiyiik (see map 1.1) and other settlements. 
Archaeologists have found pottery from this period in the 
Balkans, and by about 3500 bce the technology of pottery mak¬ 
ing appeared in western Europe.

In Europe, artists also used clay to fashion figurines, such as a

long, thick neck, and sharp edges articulate her corporeality— 
across her breasts, for instance, and at the fold of her pelvis. 
Elbowless arms meet where her hands rest on her raised knee, 
delineating a triangle and enclosing space within the sculptural 
form. This emphasizes the figurines three-dimensionality, 
encouraging a viewer to look at it from several angles, moving 
around it or shifting it in the hand. The abstraction highlights the 
pose; yet, tempting as it may be to interpret this, perhaps as 
coquettishness, we should be cautious about reading meaning into 
it, since gestures can have dramatically different meanings from 
one culture to another. Found in a tomb, the couple may repre¬ 
sent the deceased, or mourners; perhaps they were gifts that had a 
separate purpose before burial. 


Architecture in Europe: Tombs and Rituals 

Neolithic people of western and northern Europe framed their 
dwellings mostly in wood, with walls of wattle (branches woven 
into a frame) and daub (mud or earth dried around the wattle) and 
roofs of thatch, which rarely survive. At Skara Brae, on the island 
of Orkney just off the northern tip of Scotland, is a group of ten 
houses built of stone, dating to between 3100 and 2600 bce. The 
builders sunk them into mounds for protection against the harsh 
weather, and connected them by covered passages. A typical 
house had a square room, with walls of flat unmortared stones 
(fig. 1.23). Driftwood and whalebone supported a roof of turf 
thatch. At the center of the room was a hearth for cooking, and 
the inhabitants built furniture—such as beds and shelving—out of 
large flat stones. 

It was a concern for ceremonial burial and ritual, rather than 
for protection, that inspired Neolithic people of western and 
northern Europe to create monumental architecture. They 
defined spaces for tombs and rituals with huge blocks of stone

known as megaliths. Often they mounted the blocks in a trilithic 
(three-stone) post-and-lintel arrangement (with two upright 
stones supporting a third horizontal capstone) (see fig. 1.25) to 
construct tombs for the dead with one or more chambers. Termed 
dolmen tombs, they were both impressive and durable. At some 
sites, upright megaliths known as menhirs marked out horizontal 
space in distinct ways, and perhaps served as ritual centers. 
Between 4250 and 3750 bce at Menec, in the Carnac region on the 
south coast of Brittany (see map 1.1), over 3,000 megaliths set 
upright at regular intervals in long, straight rows stretch out over 
2 miles (3 km). Typically, the smaller stones of about 3 feet in 
height stand at the eastern end, and, gradually, the height of the 
stones increases, reaching over 13 feet at the western end (fig. 
1.24). Scholars argue that the lines, with their east-west orienta¬ 
tion, gauged the suns position in the sky at different times of the 
year, functioning as a calendar for an agrarian people whose 
sustenance depended on the suns cycle. Quarrying, shaping, 
transporting, and erecting these blocks was an extraordinary feat. 
Quite apart from remarkable engineering expertise, it required a 
highly efficient organization of manpower. The resulting monu¬ 
ment, with its simple repeated forms identical in shape yet diverse 
in size, static yet cast into motion by the suns slow and constant 
passage, has a calm grandeur and majesty that imposes quiet order 
on the open landscape. 


Often, megaliths appear in circles, known as cromlechs. This 
is the prevalent arrangement in Britain, where the best-known 
megalithic structure is Stonehenge, on the Salisbury Plain (figs. 
1.25 and 1.26). What now appears as a unified design is in fact the 
result of at least four construction phases, beginning with a huge 
ditch defining a circle some 330 feet in diameter in the white chalk 
ground, and an embankment of over 6 feet running around the 
inside. A wide stone-lined avenue led from the circle to a pointed 
gray sandstone (sarsen) megalith, known today as the Heel Stone. 
By about 2100 bce, Stonehenge had grown into a horseshoe-shaped 
arrangement of five sarsen triliths, encircled by a ring of upright 
blocks capped with a lintel; between the rings was a circle of smaller 
bluestone blocks. Recent excavations exposed remains of a simi¬ 
lar monument built of wood 2 miles (3 km) away, as well as rem¬ 
nants of a village. Archaeologists believe the structures are related. 

Exactly what Stonehenge—and its nearby counterpart—signi¬ 
fied to those who constructed them is a tantalizing mystery. Many 
prehistorians believe that Stonehenge, like Menec, marked the 
passing of time. Given its monumentality, most also concur that it 
had a ritual function, perhaps associated with burial; its careful 
circular arrangement supports this conjecture, as circles are cen¬ 
tral to rituals in many societies. Indeed, these two qualities led 
medieval observers to believe that King Arthurs magician, 
Merlin, created Stonehenge, and it continues to draw crowds on

Dating Techniques 


O ne of the chief concerns of archaeologists and art historians, 
regardless of the period in which they conduct research, is to be 
able to place works of art in a historical context. This means that dat¬ 
ing an object is of paramount importance. Scholars assign two types 
of date: relative dates and absolutes dates. A relative date indicates 
that one object is older or more recent than another. To determine 
these dates, archaeologists tend to use stratigraphy: An object found 
at a lower layer or stratum of an excavation is normally older than an 
object found above it. The relative chronology of one site can be 
transferred to another site if objects of a similar kind appear at both. 
Pottery is a useful indicator of relative date for most ancient cultures 
because it is so durable that it exists in great profusion, often in an 
uninterrupted sequence. 

Absolute dating assigns a calendar date to an object. In historical 
cultures (those with written documents), written records might pre¬ 
serve a date. For instance, building inscriptions indicate that the 
Athenians constructed the Parthenon between 447 and 432 bce. 
Researchers have developed numerous other methods for establish¬ 


ing absolute dates. These include radiometric dating, which works 
well for dating organic materials up to approximately 40,000 years 
old. Living organisms contain radioactive isotopes (such as carbon- 
1 4) that decay at a known rate after its death. By measuring the level 
of isotopes in organic material, archaeologists can gauge when it 
lived. Though effective, this method requires destroying part of the 
object, and can only establish when an organism died, not when an 
artist turned it into an artifact. 

Some other techniques measure radiation levels. For instance, 
thermoluminescence is an effective dating technique for objects 
containing crystalline materials that have been exposed to high 
temperatures—such as pottery, which has been fired. Fleat releases 
electrons trapped in the object’s crystalline lattice, resulting in 
a “zeroing” radiation moment. Thereafter, electrons accumulate 
again. By measuring the luminescence (light, which is proportional to 
the number of electrons released) of the object during a second 
heating, archaeologists can determine the length of time since the 
zeroing event.

summer solstices. What is certain is that, like Menec, Stonehenge 
represents tremendous organization of labor and engineering 
skill. The largest trilith, at the center of the horseshoe, soars 24 
feet, supporting a lintel 15 feet long and 3 feet thick. The sarsen 
blocks weigh up to 50 tons apiece, and traveled 23 miles (37 km) 
from the Marlborough Downs; the bluestones originated 200 
miles (320 km) away, in the Welsh Preseli mountains. The blocks 
reveal evidence of meticulous stone working. Holes hollowed 
out of the capstones fit snugly over projections on the uprights 
(forming a mortise-and-tenon joint), to make a stable structure. 
Moreover, upright megaliths taper upward, with a central 
bulge, visually implying the weight they bear, and capturing an 
energy that gives life to the stones. The lintels are worked in two 
directions, their faces inclining outward by about 6 inches to 
appear vertical from the ground, while at the same time they curve 
around on the horizontal plane to make a smooth circle. Art his¬ 
torians usually associate this kind of refinement with the 
Parthenon of Classical Athens (see fig. 5.40). 

Prehistoric art raises many questions. While we know humans 
began to express themselves visually during the prehistoric age, 
there are no written records to explain their intentions. Even 
so, by the end of the era, people had established techniques of 
painting, sculpting, and pottery making, and begun to construct 


monumental works of architecture. They developed a strong 
sense of the power of images and spaces: They recognized how to 
produce naturalistic and abstract figures, and how to alter space in 
sophisticated ways.

ROWING AND STORING CROPS AND RAISING ANIMALS FOR FOOD, 

the signature accomplishments of Neolithic peoples, would gradually 
change the course of civilization. Not long before they ceased to follow 
wild animal herds and gather food to survive, people began to form 
settlements. By the end of the Neolithic era, these settlements grew 


beyond the bounds of the village into urban centers. In the fourth 
millennium bee, large-scale urban communities of as many as 
40,000 people began to emerge in Mesopotamia, the land between 
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The development of cities had 
tremendous ramifications for the development of human life and 
for works of art. 

Although today the region of Mesopotamia is largely an arid 
plain, written, archaeological, and artistic evidence indicates that 
at the dawn of civilization lush vegetation covered it. By master¬ 
ing irrigation techniques, populations there exploited the rivers 
and their tributaries to enrich the fertile soil even further. New 
technologies and inventions, including the wheel and the plow, 
and the casting of tools in copper and bronze, increased food pro¬ 
duction and facilitated trade. As communities flourished, they 
grew into city-states with distinct patterns of social organization 
to address the problems of urban life. Specialization of labor and 
trade, mechanisms for the resolution of disputes, and construc¬ 
tion of defensible walls all required a central authority and 
government. 

It was probably the efficient administration that developed in 
response to these needs that generated what may have been the

earliest writing system, beginning around 3400-3200 bce, con¬ 
sisting of pictograms pressed into clay with a stylus to create 
inventories. By around 2900 bce, the Mesopotamians had refined 
the pictograms into a series of wedge-shaped signs known as 
cuneiform (from cuneus , Latin for “wedge”). They used this sys¬ 
tem for administrative accounts and the Sumerian Epic of 
Gilgamesh in the late third millennium bce. Cuneiform writing 
continued through much of the ancient era in the Near East and 
formed a cultural link between diverse groups who established 
power in the region. With the invention of writing, we enter the 
realm of history. 

The geography of Mesopotamia had other profound effects on 
developing civilizations. Unlike the narrow, fertile strip of the 
Nile Valley in Egypt, protected by deserts on either side, where 
urban communities now also began to thrive, Mesopotamia is a 
wide, shallow trough, crisscrossed by the two rivers and their 
tributaries and with few natural defenses. People wanting to 
exploit its fertile soil constantly traversed the region, entering eas¬ 
ily from any direction. Indeed, the history of the ancient Near 
East is a multicultural one; city-states were constantly at war with 
one another and only sometimes united under a single ruler. Still, 
Mesopotamian visual culture retains a surprisingly constant char¬ 
acter. Two dominant themes emerge: Art enabled and reflected 
political power; and Mesopotamians used visual narrative, explor¬ 
ing strategies for telling stories through art.

SUMERIAN ART 

The first major civilization in Mesopotamia was in the southern 
region of Sumer, near the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates 
rivers, where several city-states flourished from before 4000 bce 
(map 2.1) until about 2340 bce. Who the Sumerians were is not 
clear; often scholars can establish linkages between peoples 
through common linguistic traditions, but Sumerian is not related 
to any other known tongue. Archaeological excavations since the 
middle of the nineteenth century have unearthed many clay 
tablets with cuneiform writing including inventories and lists of 
kings, as well as poetry (fig. 2.1). Many of the earliest excavations 
concentrated on Sumerian cities mentioned in the Bible, such as 
Ur (the birthplace of Abraham) and Uruk (the biblical Erech). 
Along with architecture and writing, works of art in the form of 
sculpture, relief, and pottery inform us about Sumerian society. 

For Sumerians, life itself depended on appeasing the gods, 
who controlled natural forces and phenomena such as weather 
and water, the fertility of the land, and the movement of heavenly 
bodies. Each city had a patron deity, to whom residents owed 
both devotion and sustenance. The god’s earthly steward was the 
city’s ruler, who directed an extensive administrative staff based in 
the temple. As the produce of the city’s land belonged to the god, 
the temple staff took charge of supplying farmers with seed, work 
animals, and tools. They built irrigation systems, and stored and 
distributed the harvest. Centralized food production meant that 
much of the population could specialize in other trades. In turn, 
they donated a portion of the fruits of their labor to the temple. 
This system is known as theocratic socialism.

Mud Brick 


M ud brick was made primarily from local clay. Raw clay 
absorbs water, and then cracks after drying. As a bind¬ 
ing agent and to provide elasticity and prevent cracking, 
Sumerian builders would add vegetable matter, such as 
straw, to the clay. By forcing the mud mixture into wooden 
frames, the brick makers obtained uniformly rectangular 
bricks. They then knocked the molded bricks out of the 
frames and placed them in the sun to bake. To erect walls, 
they joined the bricks together with wet clay. One disadvan¬ 
tage of mud brick is that it is not durable. The Sumerians 
would therefore seal important exterior walls with bitumen, 
a tarlike substance, or they would use glazed bricks. 
Sometimes they covered interior walls with plaster. 

Mud brick is not a material that readily excites the imagi¬ 
nation today (in the way that, for instance, marble does), and 
because it is so highly perishable, it has rarely survived from 
ancient times to indicate how Sumerian temples might once 
have looked. However, more recent examples of mud-brick 
architecture like the kasbahs (citadels) south of Morocco’s 
Atlas mountains, at Ait Ben Haddou and elsewhere, reveal 
the extraordinary potential of the material. There, the easy 
pliability of mud brick allows for a dramatic decorative effect 
that is at once man-made and in total harmony with the 
natural colors of the earth. Notice, too, the geometric 
designs echoed in the woodwork of doorways and windows. 
First constructed in the sixteenth century ce, these buildings 
undergo constant maintenance (recently funded by UNESCO) 
to undo the weather’s frequent damage. Naturally, Sumerian 
temples may have looked quite different, but the kasbahs 
serve as a useful reminder that mud-brick construction can 
produce magnificent results.

Temple Architecture: 

Linking Heaven and Earth 

The temple was the city’s architectural focus. Good stone being 
scarce, Sumerians built predominantly with mud brick covered 
with plaster. (See Materials and Techniques , above). 

Scholars distinguish two different types of Sumerian temple. 
“Low” temples sat at ground level. Usually their four corners 
were oriented to the cardinal points of the compass. The temple 
was tripartite: Rooms serving as offices, priests’ quarters, and 
storage areas lined a rectangular main room, or cella, on its two 
long sides. The essential characteristics of “high” temples were 
similar, except that a platform raised the building above ground 
level; these platforms were gradually transformed into squat, 
stepped pyramids known as ziggurats. The names of some 
ziggurats—such as Etemenanki at Babylon (“House temple, 
bond between heaven and earth”)—suggest that they may have 
been links or portals to the heavens, where priest and god could 
commune. 


At approximately 40 to 50 feet high (at Warka and Ur), ziggu¬ 
rats functioned analogously as mountains, which held a sacred 
status for Sumerians. A source of water flowing to the valleys, 
mountains were also a place of refuge during floods, and symbol¬ 
ized the Earth’s generative power. Indeed, Sumerians knew their 
mother goddess as the Lady of the Mountain. Significantly, raised 
platforms made temples more visible. Mesopotamian texts indi¬ 
cate that the act of seeing was paramount: In seeing an object 
and finding it pleasing, a god might act favorably toward those 
who made it. The desired response of a human audience, in turn, 
was wonder. Finally, there was probably a political dimension to 
the high platform: It emphasized and maintained the priests’ 
status by visually expressing their separation from the rest of the 
community. 

Around 3500 bce, the city of Uruk (present-day Warka and 
the biblical Erech) emerged as a center of Sumerian culture, flour¬ 
ishing from trade in its agricultural surplus. One of its temples, 
the White Temple, named for its whitewashed brick surfaces, 
probably honored the sky-god Anu, chief of the Sumerian gods

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 











(fig. 2.2). It sits on a 40-foot mound constructed by filling in the 
ruins of older temples with brickwork, which suggests that the 
site itself was sacred (fig. 2.3). Recessed brickwork articulated its 



2.2 Plan of the White Temple on its ziggurat (after H. Frankfort) 


sloped sides. A system of stairs and ramps led counterclockwise 
around the mound, culminating at an entrance in the temple s 
long north side. This indirect approach is characteristic of 
Mesopotamian temple architecture (in contrast to the direct axial 
approach favored in Egypt), and the winding ascent mirrored a 
visitor s metaphorical ascent into a divine realm. From three sides, 
members of the community could also witness the ceremonial 
ascent of priests and leaders who had exclusive access to the tem¬ 
ple. Enough survives of the superstructure to indicate that thick 
buttressed walls surrounded a central, rectangular hall (cella) 
housing a stepped altar. Along the long sides of the cella were 
smaller rooms, creating an overall tripartite layout typical of the 
earliest temples. 

Uruk was the home of the legendary king Gilgamesh, hero of 
an epic poem that describes his adventures. Gilgamesh purport¬ 
edly carved his tale on a stone marker—which suggests the impor¬ 
tance of narrative in Sumerian culture. The epic credits Gilgamesh 
with building the city walls of Uruk and the Eanna, a temple of 
Inanna (goddess of love and war) or Ishtar. The poem describes 
the temples gleaming walls, built with “kiln-fired brick.” In the 
Eanna precinct, archaeologists found several temples whose walls 
were decorated with colored stone or painted clay cones set into 
plaster to form mosaic patterns. (See Primary Source , page 25.)

The Gilgamesh Epic 

One of the earliest written epics, the Gilgamesh epic survives on 
cuneiform tablets. Although the earliest texts to survive come from 
Akkadian tablets written afier 2150 BCE , the text itself dates to the 
Sumerian era, about 2800 BCE. The surviving parts of the epic recount 
the tale of Gilgamesh, the king ofU ruk, who first battles, then be friends 
the wild man Enkidu. When his friend dies, Gilgamesh goes in search of 
a way to defeat death, but eventually returns to Uruk, accepting his 
own mortality. This excerpt from the beginning of the poem describes 
(with gaps from the sources) Gilgamesh’s accomplishments as king. 

Anu granted him the totality of knowledge of all. 

He saw the Secret, discovered the Hidden, 
he brought information of (the time) before the Flood. 

He went on a distant journey, pushing himself to exhaustion, 
but then was brought to peace. 

He carved on a stone stela all of his toils, 
and built the wall of Uruk-Haven, 

the wall of the sacred Eanna Temple, the holy sanctuary. 


Look at its wall which gleams like copper(?), 

inspect its inner wall, the likes of which no one can equal! 

Take hold of the threshold stone—it dates from ancient times! 
Go close to the Eanna Temple, the residence of Ishtar, 
such as no later king or man ever equaled! 

Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around, 

examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly. 

Is not (even the core of) the brick structure made of kiln-fired 
brick, 

and did not the Seven Sages themselves lay out its plans? 

One square mile is devoted to city, one to palm gardens, one to 
lowlands, the open area(?) of the Ishtar Temple, 
three leagues and the open area(?) of Uruk it (the wall) encloses. 
Find the copper tablet box, 
open the ... of its lock of bronze, 
undo the fastening of its secret opening. 

Take out and read the lapis lazuli tablet 
how Gilgamesh went through every hardship.

Sculpture and Inlay 

The cella of Uruk s White Temple would once have contained a 
cult statue, which is now lost. Yet a female head dating to about 
3100 bce, found in the Eanna sanctuary of Inanna at Uruk, may 
indicate what a cult statue looked like (fig. 2.4). The sculptor 
carved the face of white limestone, and added details in precious

materials: a wig, perhaps of gold or copper, secured by the ridge 
running down the center of the head, and eyes and eyebrows of 
colored materials. Despite the absence of these features, the sculp¬ 
ture has not lost its power to impress: The abstraction of its large 
eyes and dramatic brow contrasts forcefully with the delicate 
modeling of the cheeks. Flat on the back, the head was once 
attached to a body, presumably made of wood, and the full figure 
must have stood near life-size. 

TELL ASMAR A group of sculptures excavated in the 1930s at a 
temple at Tell Asmar illustrates a type of limestone, alabaster, and 
gypsum figures that artists began to make about 500 years after 
the carving of the Uruk head (fig. 2.5). Ranging in height from 
several inches to 2Vi feet, these figures probably originally stood in 
the temple s cella. They were purposely buried near the altar 
along with other objects, perhaps when the temple was rebuilt or 
redecorated. All but one of the figures in this group stand in a 
static pose, with hands clasped between chest and waist level. The 
style is decidedly abstract: On most of the standing male figures, 
horizontal or zigzag ridges define long hair and a full beard; the 
arms hang from wide shoulders; hands are clasped around a cup; 
narrow chests widen to broad waists; and the legs are cylindrical. 
The male figures wear fringed skirts hanging from a belt in a stiff 
cone shape, while the women have full-length drapery. Most 
scholars identify the two larger figures as cult statues of Abu, god 
of vegetation, and his consort. The others figures probably repre¬ 
sent priests, since the fringed skirt is the dress of the priesthood. 
Some statues of this kind from elsewhere are inscribed with the 
name of the god and of the worshiper who dedicated the statue. 

The poses and the costumes represent conventions of 
Sumerian art that later Mesopotamians adopted. Most distinctive 
are the faces, dominated by wide, almost round eyes. Dark inlays

of lapis lazuli and shells set in bitumen accentuate the eyes, as do 
powerful eyebrows that meet over the bridge of the nose. As 
noted above, seeing was a major channel of communication with 
gods, and the sculptures may have been responding to the gods 
awe-inspiring nature with eyes wide open in admiration. Enlarged 
eyes were also a conventional means of warding off evil in 
Mesopotamia, known today as an apotropaic device. Several of 
these statues were in the Iraq Museum, and were looted during 
recent unrest in Baghdad (see The Art Historian's Lens , page 29). 

THE ROYAL CEMETERY AT UR The Sumerian city of Ur in 
southern Mesopotamia first attracted archaeologists because of its 
biblical associations. Its extensive cemetery was well preserved 
under the walls of King Nebuchadnezzar Us later city, and 
Leonard Woolley discovered a wide variety of Sumerian objects 
in excavations there during the 1920s. The cemetery contained 
some 1,840 burials dating between 2600 and 2000 bce. Some 
were humble, but others were substantial subterranean structures 
and contained magnificent offerings, earning them the designation

of “royal graves,” even though it remains uncertain whether 
the deceased were royalty, priests, or members of another elite. 
So-called Death Pits accompanied the wealthiest burials. 
Foremost among them was the Great Death Pit, in which 74 sol¬ 
diers, attendants, and musicians were interred, apparently 
drugged before lying down in the grave as human sacrifices. Even 
in death, the elite maintained the visible trappings of power and 
required the services of their retainers. These finds suggest that 
Sumerians may have believed in an afterlife. 

Among the many kinds of grave goods Woolley found in the 
Royal Cemetery were weapons, jewelry, and vessels. Many of the 
objects display the great skill of Sumerian artists in representing 
nature. A pair of wild goats rearing up on their hind legs against a 
flowering tree probably functioned as stands for offerings to a 
deity. Gold leaf is the dominant material, used for the goat s head, 
legs, and genitals, as well as for the tree and a cylindrical support 
strut rising from the goat s back in the one shown here (fig. 2.6). 
Lapis lazuli on the horns and neck fleece complements the shell 


fragments decorating the body fleece and the ears of copper. The 
base is an intricately crafted pattern of red limestone, shell, and 
lapis lazuli. Images on cylinder seals show that a bowl or saucer 
would have been balanced on the horns and the support cylinder. 
The combination of the goat (sacred to the god Tammuz) and the 
carefully arranged flowers (rosettes sacred to Inanna) suggests 
that the sculpture reflects Sumerian concerns about fertility, both 
of plants and animals. 

Visual Narratives 

Two objects from the Royal Cemetery at Ur offer glimpses of the 
development of visual narrative in Mesopotamia. The Royal 
Standard ofU r, of about 2600 bce, consists of four panels of red 
limestone, shell, and lapis lazuli inlay set in bitumen, originally 
attached to a wooden framework (fig. 2.7). The damaged side pan¬ 
els depicted animal scenes, while the two larger sections show a 
military victory and a celebration or ritual feast, each unfolding in

three superposed registers, or horizontal bands. Reading from 
the bottom, the "war” panel shows charioteers advancing from 
the left, pulled by onagers (wild asses), and riding over enemy 
bodies. In the middle register, infantry soldiers do battle and 
escort prisoners of war, stripped of armor and clothing. At the 
top, soldiers present the prisoners to a central figure, whose 
importance the artist signals through his position and through his 
larger size, a device known as hieratic scale; his head even breaks 
through the register’s frame to emphasize his importance. In the 
"banquet” panel, figures burdened with booty accompany 
onagers and animals for a feast. Their dress identifies them as trav¬ 
elers from northern Sumer and probably Kish, the region later 
known as Akkad. In the top register, the banquet is already under¬ 
way. Seated figures raise their cups to the sound of music from a 
nearby harpist and singer; a larger figure toward the left of the 
scene is presumably a leader or king, perhaps the same figure as 
on the "war” side. Together, the panels represent the dual aspects 
of kingship: the king as warrior, and the king as priest and medi¬ 
ator with the gods. Despite the action in the scenes, the images 
have a static quality, which the figures’ isolation emphasizes (a 
staccato treatment): Their descriptive forms (half frontal, half 


profile) rarely overlap. This, and the contrasting colored materi¬ 
als, give the narrative an easy legibility, even from a distance. 

On excavating the Royal Standard ofU r, Woolley envisioned 
it held aloft on a pole as a military standard, and named it accord¬ 
ingly. In fact, it is unclear how the Sumerians used the object. It 
may have been the sounding-box for a stringed instrument, an 
object that was commonly deposited in burials. In one of the 
cemetery’s most lavish graves, the grave of "Queen” Pu-abi, 
Woolley discovered a lyre decorated with a bull’s head of gold 
gilt and lapis lazuli, dating to ca. 2600 bce (fig. 2.8), comparable 
to the lyre on the Standard. On its sounding-box, a panel of 
shell inlaid in bitumen depicts a male figure in a heraldic 
composition, embracing two human-faced bulls and facing a 
viewer with a frontal glare (fig. 2.9). In the lower registers, animals 
perform human tasks such as carrying foodstuffs and playing 
music. These scenes may have evoked a myth or fable that 
contemporary viewers knew either in written or in oral form, and 
that was perhaps associated with a funerary context. In some 
cultures, fantastic hybrid creatures, such as the bulls or the man 
with a braided, snakelike body in the bottom scene, served an 
apotropaic function.

THE ANCIENT WORLD 














Losses Through Looting 


T he archaeologist’s greatest nemesis is the looter, who pillages 
ancient sites to supply the world’s second largest illicit business: 
the illegal trade in antiquities. The problem is worldwide, but recent 
publicity has focused on Iraq, where thousands of archaeological sites 
still await proper excavation. Looters are often local people, living in 
impoverished conditions but supported and organized by more pow¬ 
erful agents; just as frequently, looters work in organized teams, arriv¬ 
ing on site with jackhammers and bulldozers, wielding weapons to 
overcome whatever meager security there might be. Often employing 
the most sophisticated tools, such as remote-sensing and satellite 
photography, they move quickly and unscrupulously through a site, 
careless of what they destroy in their search for treasure. Loot changes 
hands quickly as it crosses national borders, fetching vast sums on the 
market. Little or none of this fortune returns to local hands. 

Even more is at stake in these transactions than the loss of a 
nation’s heritage. Only a fraction of the value of an archaeological find 
resides in the object itself. Much more significant is what its findspot— 
the place where it was found—can tell archaeologists, who use the 
information to construct a history of the past. An object’s location 
within a city or building reveals how it was used. A figurine, for 
instance, could be a fertility object, doll, or cult image, depending on 
its physical context. The exact level, or stratum, at which archaeolo¬ 
gists find an object discloses when it was in use. On some sites, 
stratigraphy (reading levels/strata) yields very precise dates. If an 


object comes to light far from its place of manufacture, its findspot 
can even document interactions between cultures. 

A 1 970 UNESCO Convention requires member states to prohibit the 
importation of stolen antiquities from other member states, and offers 
help in protecting cultural property that is in jeopardy of pillage. To 
date, 11 5 countries are party to the convention.

Cylinder Seals 

The Mesopotamians also produced vast numbers of cylinder seals, 
which the administration used to seal jars and secure storerooms. 
The seals were cylindrical objects usually made of stone, with a 
hole running through the center from end to end. A sculptor 
carved a design into the curved surface of the seal, so that when 
the owner impressed it in soft clay, a raised, reverse image would 
unfold, repeated as the cylinder rolled along. Great quantities of 
seals and sealings (seal impressions) have survived. Many are of 
modest quality, reflecting their primarily administrative purpose, 


but the finest examples display a wealth of detail and a high level 
of sculptural expertise. With subjects ranging from divine and 
royal scenes to monumental architecture, animals, and daily activ¬ 
ities, the seals provide critical information about Mesopotamian 
existence and values. The sealing illustrated here appears to show 
the feeding of the temple herd, which provided a significant 
portion of the temples wealth (fig. 2.10). The human figures 
distinctive costume and hat may identify him as a priest-king; 
some have seen the large vessels as a reference to sacred offerings, 
and excavators found one such vase, measuring nearly 3 feet in 
height, in the Eanna precinct at Uruk, dating to ca. 3200 bce.

STORI AN ’ 













ART OF AKKAD 


Around 2350 bce, Sumerian city-states began to fight over access 
to water and fertile land. Gradually, their social organization was 
transformed as local “stewards of the god” positioned themselves 
as ruling kings. The more ambitious tried to enlarge their domains 
through conquest. Semitic-speaking people (those who used lan¬ 
guages in the same family as Hebrew and Arabic) from the 
northern region gradually assumed positions of power in the 
south. Although they adopted many features of Sumerian civiliza¬ 
tion, they were less bound to the tradition of the city-state. 
Sargon (meaning “true king”) conquered Sumer, as well as 
northern Syria and Elam (to the northeast of Sumer) in about 
2334 bce (see map 2.1), basing himself in the city of Akkad (a site 
unknown today, but probably to the northwest of Sumer, near 
present-day Baghdad). Akkadian then became the language of 
authority in Mesopotamia. Sargon s ambitions were both imperial

and dynastic. He combined Sumerian and Akkadian deities in a 
new pantheon, hoping to break down the traditional link between 
city-states and their local gods, and thereby to unite the region in 
loyalty to his absolute rule. Under his grandson, Naram-Sin, who 
ruled from 2254 to 2218 bce, the Akkadian Empire stretched 
from Sumer in the south to Elam in the east, and then to Syria in 
the west and Nineveh in the north. 

Sculpture: Power and Narrative 

Akkadian rulers increasingly exploited the visual arts to establish 
and reflect their power. A magnificent copper portrait head found 
in a rubbish heap at Nineveh, dated to between 2250 and 2200 bce 
and sometimes identified as Naram-Sin himself (fig. 2.11), derives 
its extraordinary power from a number of factors: The intended 
view of the portrait was from the front, and this frontality makes 
it appear unchanging and eternal. The abstract treatment of beard 
and hair (which is arranged like a Sumerian king s) contrasts with 
the smooth flesh to give the head a memorable simplicity and 
strong symmetry, which denote control and order. The intricate, 
precise patterning of hair and beard testifies to the metalworker s 
expertise in hollow casting (see Materials and Techniques , page 
128). Furthermore, at a time before many people understood the 
science of metallurgy, the use of cast metal for a portrait demon¬ 
strated the patron s control of a technology that most associated 
primarily with weaponry. In its original form, the portrait proba¬ 
bly had eyes inlaid with precious and semiprecious materials, as 
other surviving figures do. The damage to the portrait was prob¬ 
ably incurred during the Medes’ invasion of Nineveh in 612 bce. 
The enemy gouged out its eyes and hacked off its ears, nose, and 
lower beard, as if attacking the person represented. Many cul¬ 
tures, even today, practice such acts of ritualized vandalism as 
symbolic acts of violence or protest. 

The themes of power and narrative combine in a 6Z-foot stele 
(upright marker stone) erected in the Akkadian city of Sippar dur¬ 
ing the rule of Naram-Sin (fig. 2.12). The stele commemorates 
Naram-Sins victory over the Lullubi, people of the Zagros 
mountains in eastern Mesopotamia, in relief. This time the story 
does not unfold in registers; instead, ranks of soldiers, in compos¬ 
ite view, climb the wavy contours of a wooded mountain. Their 
ordered march contrasts with the enemy s chaotic rout: As the 
victorious soldiers trample the fallen foe underfoot, the defeated 
beg for mercy or lie contorted in death. Above them, the king s 
large scale and central position make his identity clear. He stands 
isolated against the background, next to a mountain peak that 
suggests his proximity to the divine. His horned crown, formerly 
an exclusive accoutrement of the gods, marks him as the first 
Mesopotamian king to deify himself (an act that his people did 
not unanimously welcome). The bold musculature of his limbs 
and his powerful stance cast him as a heroic figure. Solar deities 
shine auspiciously overhead, as if witnessing his victory. 

The stele of Naram-Sin still communicated its message of 
power over a thousand years later. In 1157 bce, the Elamites of 
southwestern Iran invaded Mesopotamia and seized it as war

booty. An inscription on the stele records that they then installed 
it in the city of Susa (see map 2.1). By capturing the defeated citys 
victory monument, they symbolically stole Naram-Sin s former 
glory and doubly defeated their foe. 

NEO-SUMERIAN REVIVAL 

The rule of the Akkadian kings came to an end when a mountain 
people, the Guti, gained control of the Mesopotamian Plain in 
about 2230 bce. The cities of Sumer rose up in retaliation and 
drove them out in 2112 bce, under the leadership of King 
Urnammu of Ur (the present-day city of Muqaiyir, Iraq, and the 
birthplace of the biblical Abraham), who united a realm that was 
to last 100 years. As part of his renewal project, he returned to 
building on a magnificent scale. 

Architecture: The Ziggurat ofUr 

Part of Urnammu s legacy is the Great Ziggurat at Ur of about 
2100 bce, dedicated to the moon god, Nanna (Sin in Akkadian) 
(fig. 2.13). Its 190-by-l 30-foot base soared to a height of 50 feet 
in three stepped stages. The base consisted of solid mud brick 
faced with baked bricks set in bitumen, a tarry material used here 
as mortar. Although not structurally functional, thick buttresses 
(vertical supporting elements) articulate the walls, giving an 
impression of strength. Moreover, a multitude of upward lines 
adds a dynamic energy to the monuments appearance. Three 
staircases, now reconstructed, converged high up at the fortified 
gateway. Each consisting of 100 steps, one stood perpendicular 
to the temple, the other two parallel to the base wall. From the 
gateway, a fourth staircase, which does not survive, once rose to 
the temple proper. The stairways may have provided an imposing 
setting for ceremonial processions. 


Sculpture: Figures ofGudea 

Contemporary with Urnammu s rule in Ur, Gudea became ruler 
of neighboring Lagash (in present-day Iraq), a small Sumerian 
city-state that had retained independence after the collapse of 
Akkad. Reserving the title of king for Lagashs city-god, 
Ningirsu, Gudea promoted the gods cult through an ambitious 
reconstruction of his temple. According to inscriptions, Ningirsu 
appeared to Gudea in a dream after the Tigris River had failed to 
rise and instructed him to build the temple.

Texts on Gudea Figures from 
Lagash and Surrounding 
Areas, ca. 2100 

Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, commissioned numerous temples and many 
figures of himself to he placed in the temples. Many of these figures 
(compare figs. 2.14 and 2.15) are inscribed with cuneiform texts that 
provide insight into the function of each image. 

In this excerpt, the god Ningirsu speaks to Gudea, encouraging him 
to rebuild his temple: 

When, O faithful shepherd Gudea, 

Thou shalt have started work for me on Eninnu, my royal abode, 


I will call up in heaven a humid wind. 

It shall bring thee abundance from on high 
And the country shall spread its hands upon riches in thy 
time. 

Prosperity shall accompany the laying of the foundations of my 
house. 

All the great fields will bear for thee; 

Dykes and canals will swell for thee; 

Where the water is not wont to rise 
To high ground it will rise for thee. 

Oil will be poured abundantly in Sumer in thy time, 

Good weight of wool will be given in thy time. 

Source: H. Frankfort, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, 4th ed. (New Haven: 
Yale University Press, 1 970, p. 98). 




Of the building itself, nothing now remains. Yet some 20 
examples of distinctive statues representing Gudea survive. He 
had dedicated (or given as an offering) the images at the temple 
and in other shrines of Lagash and vicinity (figs. 2.14 and 2.15), 
and they served as a mark of his piety, at the same time as they also 
extended the Akkadian tradition of exalting the ruler’s person.

was hard to work, they testify to Gudea s great wealth. Whether 
standing or seated in pose, the statues are remarkably consistent 
in appearance: Often wearing a thick woolen cap, Gudea has a 
long garment draped over one shoulder, and clasps his hands 
across his front in a pose similar to statues from Tell Asmar of 500 
years earlier. Like those figures, Gudea s eyes are wide open, in 
awe. The highly polished surface and precise modeling allow light 
to play upon the features, showcasing the sculptors’ skills. 
Rounded forms emphasize the figures’ compactness, giving them 
an impressive monumentality. 

In the life-size seated example shown in figure 2.15, Gudea 
holds the ground plan of Ningirsu’s temple on his lap. 
Inscriptions carved on the statue reveal that the king had to fol¬ 
low the god’s instructions meticulously to ensure the temple’s 
sanctity. The inscriptions also provide Gudea’s motivation for 
building the temple, and his personal commitment to the project: 
By obeying the god, he would bring fortune to his city. (See 
Primary Source, above.) Following Ningirsu’s instruction, Gudea 
purified the city and swept away the soil on the temple’s site to 
expose bedrock. He then laid out the temple according to the 
design that Ningirsu had revealed to him, and helped manufacture 
and carry mud bricks. 

BABYLONIAN ART 

The late third and early second millennia bce were a time of tur¬ 
moil and warfare in Mesopotamia. The region was then unified 
for over 300 years under a Babylonian dynasty. During the reign 
of its most famous ruler, Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 bce), the city 
of Babylon assumed the dominant role formerly played by Akkad 
and Ur. Combining military prowess with respect for Sumerian 
tradition, Hammurabi cast himself as “the favorite shepherd” of 
the sun-god Shamash, stating his mission “to cause justice to pre¬ 
vail in the land and to destroy the wicked and evil, so that the 
strong might not oppress the weak nor the weak the strong.” 
Babylon retained its role as cultural center of Sumer for more than 
1,000 years after its political power had waned. 


CHAPTER 2 ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN ART 33 


OUR 



The Code of Hammurabi 

Posterity remembers Hammurabi best for his law code. It sur¬ 
vives as one of the earliest written bodies of law, engraved on a 
black basalt stele reaching to over 7 feet in height (fig. 2.16). The 
text consists of 3,500 lines of Akkadian cuneiform, and begins 
with an account of the temples Hammurabi restored. The largest 
portion concerns commercial and property law, rulings on 
domestic issues, and questions of physical assault, detailing penal¬ 
ties for noncompliers (including the renowned Hebrew Bible 
principle of “an eye for an eye”). (See Primary Source , page 35.) 
The text concludes with a paean to Hammurabi as peacemaker. 

At the top of the stele, Hammurabi appears in relief, standing 
with his arm raised in greeting before the enthroned sun-god 
Shamash. The gods shoulders emanate sun rays, and he extends 
his hand, holding the rope ring and the measuring rod of kingship; 
this single gesture unifies both the scene’s composition and the 
implied purpose of the two protagonists. The image is a variant on 
the “introduction scene” found on cylinder seals, where a goddess 
leads a human individual with his hand raised in salute before a 
seated godlike figure, who bestows his blessing. Hammurabi 
appears without the benefit—or need—of a divine intercessor, 
implying an especially close relationship with the sun-god. Still, 
the smaller scale of Hammurabi compared to the seated god 
expresses his status as “shepherd” rather than god himself. The 
symmetrical composition and smooth surfaces result in a legible 
image of divinely ordained power that is fully in line with 
Mesopotamian traditions. Like the stele of Naram-Sin, 
Hammurabi’s stele later became war booty, when the Elamites 
carried it off to Susa. 

ASSYRIAN ART 

Babylon fell around 1595 bce to the Hittites, who had established 
themselves in Anatolia (present-day Turkey). When they 
departed, they left a weakened Babylonian state vulnerable to 
other invaders: the Kassites from the northwest and the Elamites 
from the east. Although a second Babylonian dynasty rose to 
great heights under Nebuchadnezzar I of Isin (r. 1125-1104 bce), 
the Assyrians more or less controlled southern Mesopotamia 
by the end of the millennium. Their home was the city-state of 
Assur, sited on the upper course of the Tigris and named for the 
god Ashur. 

Art of Empire: Expressing Royal Power 

Under a series of able rulers, beginning with Ashur-uballit 
(r. 1363-1328? bce), the Assyrian realm expanded. At its height, 
in the seventh century bce, the empire stretched from the Sinai 
peninsula to Armenia; the Assyrians even invaded Egypt success¬ 
fully in about 670 bce (see map 2.1). They drew heavily on the 
artistic achievements of the Sumerians and Babylonians, but 
adapted them to their own purpose. The Assyrians’ was clearly an

art of empire: propagandistic and public, designed to proclaim 
and sustain the supremacy of Assyrian civilization, particularly 
through representations of military power. The Assyrians contin¬ 
ued to build temples and ziggurats based on Sumerian models, but 
their architectural focus shifted to constructing royal palaces. 
These grew to unprecedented size and magnificence, blatantly 
expressing royal presence and domination.

The Code of Hammurabi 

Inscribed on the stele of Hammurabi in figure 2.16 , the Code of Laws 
compiled by King Hammurabi o ffers a glimpse of the lives and values 
of Babylonians in the second millennium BCE. 

Prologue 

W hen Anu the Sublime, King of the Anunaki, and Bel, the lord 
of Heaven and earth, who decreed the fate of the land, 
assigned to Marduk, the over-ruling son of Ea, God of righteousness, 
dominion over earthly man, and made him great among the Igigi, 
they called Babylon by his illustrious name, made it great on earth, 
and founded an everlasting kingdom in it, whose foundations are laid 
so solidly as those of heaven and earth; then Anu and Bel called by 
name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring 
about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and 
the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I 
should rule over the black-headed people like Shamash, and enlighten 
the land, to further the well-being of mankind. ... 

The Code of Laws [excerpts] 

I f any one bring an accusation against a man, and the accused go to 
the river and leap into the river, if he sink in the river his accuser 
shall take possession of his house. But if the river prove that the 
accused is not guilty, and he escape unhurt, then he who had brought 
the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river 
shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser. ... 

If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and 
does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense 
charged, be put to death. ... 

If any one steal the property of a temple or of the court, he shall be 
put to death, and also the one who receives the stolen thing from him 
shall be put to death. ... 

If any one steal cattle or sheep, or an ass, or a pig or a goat, if it 
belong to a god or to the court, the thief shall pay thirtyfold; if they 


belonged to a freed man of the king he shall pay tenfold; if the thief 
has nothing with which to pay he shall be put to death ... 

If any one break a hole into a house (break in to steal), he shall be 
put to death before that hole and be buried ... 



If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and 
does not so keep it; if then the dam break and all the fields be flooded, 
then shall he in whose dam the break occurred be sold for money, 
and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to be 
ruined. ... 

If any one be on a journey and entrust silver, gold, precious stones, 
or any movable property to another, and wish to recover it from him; 
if the latter do not bring all of the property to the appointed place, but 
appropriate it to his own use, then shall this man, who did not bring 
the property to hand it over, be convicted, and he shall pay fivefold 
for all that had been entrusted to him. ... 

If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him chil¬ 
dren, or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall give 
that wife her dowry, and a part of the usufruct of field, garden, and 
property, so that she can rear her children. When she has brought up 
her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal as that 
of one son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man of her 
heart. ... 

If a son strike his father, his hands shall be hewn off. 

If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out. 

If he break another mans bone, his bone shall be broken. 

If a builder build a house for some one, and does not construct it 
properly, and the house which he built fall in and kill its owner, then 
that builder shall be put to death. 

If it kill the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to 
death. 

If it kill a slave of the owner, then he shall pay slave for slave to the 
owner of the house. ...

The proclamation of Assyrian royal power began well outside 
the palace, as is clear in the plan for the city of Dur Sharrukin 
(present-day Khorsabad, Iraq), where Sargon II (r. 721-705 bce) 
had his royal residence (fig. 2.17). Though much of the city 
remains unexcavated, archaeologists estimate that it covered an 
area of nearly a square mile, enclosed within an imposing mud- 
brick fortification wall. To reach the palace, a visitor had to cross 
the city, traversing open plazas and climbing broad ramps. On the 
northwest side, a walled and turreted citadel closed the ziggurat 
and the palace off from the rest of the town and emphasized their 
dominant presence. Enclosing temple and palace, the citadel 
revealed the privileged relationship between the king and the 
gods. Both structures stood atop a mound 50 feet high, which

raised them above the flood plain and expressed the king s ele¬ 
vated status above the rest of society. The ziggurat had at least 
four stages, each about 18 feet high and of a different color, and a 
spiral ramp wound around it to the top. 

The palace complex comprised about 30 courtyards and 200 
rooms, and monumental imagery complemented this impressive 
scale. At the gateways stood huge, awe-inspiring guardian figures 
known as lamassu, in the shape of winged, human-headed bulls 
(fig. 2.18). The illustration here shows the lamassu of Khorsabad 
during excavation in the 1840s; masons subsequently sawed up 
one of the pair for transportation to the Louvre in Paris. The mas¬ 
sive creatures are almost in the round (fully three-dimensional 


and separate from the background). Carved out of the limestone 
of the palace wall, they are one with the building. Yet the addition 
of a fifth leg, visible from the side, reveals that the sculptor con¬ 
ceived of them as deep relief sculptures on two sides of the stone 
block, so that the figures are legible both frontally and in profile. 
From the front, the lamassu appear stationary, yet the additional 
leg sets them in motion when seen from the side. With their tall, 
horned headdresses and deep-set eyes, and the powerful muscu¬ 
larity of their legs and bodies, all set off by delicate patterning of 
the beard and feathers, they towered over any approaching visi¬ 
tor, embodying the king s fearful authority The Assyrians may 
have believed the hybrid creatures had the power to ward off evil

spirits. Contemporary texts indicate that sculptors also cast 
lamassu in bronze, but because these images were later melted 
down, none now survives. 

Once inside a royal palace, a visitor would confront another 
distinctive feature of Assyrian architecture: upright gypsum slabs 
called orthostats, with which builders lined the lower walls. 
Structurally, the slabs protected the mud brick from moisture and 
wear, but they served a communicative purpose as well. On their 
surfaces, narrative images in low relief, painted in places for 
emphasis, glorified the king with detailed depictions of lion hunts 
and military conquests (with inscriptions giving supplementary 
information). In these reliefs, the Assyrian forces march indefati- 
gably onward, meeting the enemy at the empires frontiers, 
destroying his strongholds, and carrying away booty and prison¬ 
ers of war. Actions take place in a continuous band, propelling a 
viewer from scene to scene, and repetition of key images creates 
the impression of an inevitable Assyrian triumph. This detail (fig. 
2.19), from the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883— 
859 bce) at Nimrud (ancient Kalah, biblical Calah, Iraq), shows 
the enemy fleeing an advance party by swimming across a river on 
inflatable animal skins. From their fortified city, an archer—pos¬ 
sibly the king—and two women look on with hands raised. The 
artist intersperses landscape elements with humans, yet shows no 
concern to capture relative scale, or to depict all elements from a 
single viewpoint. This suggests that the primary purpose of the 
scenes was to recount specific enemy conquests in descriptive 
detail; depicting them in a naturalistic way was not critical. 

As in Egypt (discussed in Chapter 3), royal lion hunts were 
staged events that took place in palace grounds. Royal attendants 
released animals from cages into a square formed by troops with 
shields. Earlier Mesopotamian rulers hunted lions to protect their 
subjects, but by the time of the Assyrians, the activity had become 


more symbolic, ritually showcasing the king s strength and serv¬ 
ing as a metaphor for military prowess. On a section of Assyrian 
relief from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal (r. 668-627 bce) at 
Nineveh, dating to roughly 645 bce (fig. 2.20), the king races for¬ 
ward in his chariot with bow drawn, leaving wounded and dead 
lions in his wake. A wounded lion leaps at the chariot as atten¬ 
dants plunge spears into its chest. Its body is hurled flat out in a 
clean diagonal line, its claws spread and mouth open in what 
appears to be pain combined with desperate ferocity. To ennoble 
the victims of the hunt, the sculptor contrasted the limp, con¬ 
torted bodies of the slain animals with the taut leaping lion and 
the powerful energy of the king s party. Yet we should not con¬ 
clude that the artist necessarily hoped to evoke sympathy for the 
creatures, or to comment on the cruelty of a staged hunt; it is 
more likely that by ennobling the lions the sculptor intended to 
glorify their vanquisher, the king, even more intensely. 

LATE BABYLONIAN ART 

Perpetually under threat, the Assyrian Empire came to an end in 
612 bce, when Nineveh fell to the Medes (an Indo-European¬ 
speaking people from western Iran) and the resurgent 
Babylonians. Under the Chaldean dynasty, the ancient city of 
Babylon had a final brief flowering between 612 and 539 bce, 
before the Persians conquered it. The best known of these Late 
Babylonian rulers was Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 604-ca. 562 bce), 
builder of the biblical Tower of Babel, which soared 270 feet high 
and came to symbolize overweening pride. He was also responsible 
for the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, numbered among 
the seven wonders of the ancient world compiled by Greek histo¬ 
rians by the second century bce. 


CHAPTER 2 ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN ART 37 












The Royal Palace 

The royal palace at Babylon was on almost the same scale as 
Assyrian palaces, with numerous reception suites framing five 
huge courtyards. Instead of facing their buildings with carved 
stone, the Late Babylonians adopted baked and glazed brick, 
which they molded into individual shapes. Glazing brick involved 
putting a film of glass over the brick s surface. Late Babylonians 
used it both for surface ornament and for reliefs on a grand scale. 
Its vivid coloristic effect appears on the courtyard facade of the 
Throne Room and the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar 
Gate and the gate itself, now reassembled in Berlin (fig. 2.21). 
A framework of brightly colored ornamental bands contains a 
procession of bulls, dragons, and other animals, set off in molded 
brick against a deep blue background. The animals portrayed 
were sacred: White and yellow snake-necked dragons to Marduk, 
the chief Babylonian god; yellow bulls with blue hair to Adad, 
god of storms; and white and yellow lions to Ishtar herself, god¬ 
dess of love and war. Unlike the massive muscularity of the

lamassu, their forms are light and agile-looking, arrested in a pro¬ 
cessional stride that slowly accompanies ceremonial processions 
leading to the archway of the gate. 

REGIONAL NEAR EASTERN ART 

Alongside the successive cultures of Mesopotamia, a variety of 
other cultures developed in areas beyond the Tigris and 
Euphrates. Some of them invaded or conquered contemporane¬ 
ous city-states in Mesopotamia, as did the Hittites in the north 
and the Iranians in the east. Others, such as the seagoing 
Phoenicians on the Mediterranean coast to the west, traded with 
the people of Mesopotamia and in so doing spread Mesopotamian 
visual forms to Africa and Europe. 

The Hittites 

The Hittites were responsible for Babylon's overthrow in 1595 
bce. An Indo-European-speaking people, they had probably 
entered Anatolia from southern Russia in the late third millen¬ 
nium bce and settled on its rocky plateau as one of several cul¬ 
tures that developed independently of Mesopotamia. As they 
came into contact with Mesopotamian traditions, the Hittites 
adopted cuneiform writing for their language, and preserved 
details of their history on clay tablets. Emerging as a power 
around 1800 bce, they rapidly expanded their territory 150 years 
later under Hattusilis I. Their empire extended over most of pres¬ 
ent-day Turkey and Syria, which brought them into conflict with 
the imperial ambitions of Egypt. The Hittite Empire reached its 
apogee between 1400 and 1200 bce. Its capital was Hattusa, near 
the present-day Turkish village of Bogazkoy. Fortification walls 
protected the city, constructed of huge, irregularly shaped stones 
that were widely available in the region. At the city gates, massive 
limestone lions and other guardian figures protruded from the 
blocks that formed the jambs (fig. 2.22). The Lion Gate is 7 feet 
high, and though badly weathered, the figures still impress visitors 
with their ferocity and stark frontality. These powerful guardians 
probably inspired the later Assyrian lamassu (see fig. 2.18). 

The Phoenicians 

The Phoenicians, too, contributed a distinctive body of work to 
Near Eastern art. Living on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean 
in the first millennium bce in what is now Lebanon, they devel¬ 
oped formidable seafaring skills, which led them to found settle¬ 
ments farther west in the Mediterranean (most notably on the 
North African coast and in Spain). They became a linchpin in the 
rapidly growing trade in objects—and ideas—between East and 
West. The Phoenicians were especially adept in working metal 
and ivory, and in making colored glass. They readily incorporated 
motifs from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean coast, as seen in 
the open-work ivory plaque illustrated here (fig. 2.23), on which 
is poised an Egyptian winged sphinx. The plaque dates to the

eighth century bce, and came to light in Fort Shalmaneser at 
Nimrud, the Assyrian capital where the conquering Assyrian 
kings had probably taken it as booty. Though the details are 
Egyptian—its wig and apron, the stylized plants—the carver has 
reduced its double crown to fit neatly within the panel, suggest¬ 
ing that what mattered was a general quality of “Egyptianness” 
rather than an accurate portrayal of Egyptian motifs. The 
rounded forms and profile presentation translate the Egyptian 
motif into a visual form more familiar to Mesopotamian eyes. 

The Hebrews 

According to later tradition, the Akkadians expelled the Hebrews 
from Mesopotamia in about 2000 bce. The latter settled in 
Canaan, on the eastern Mediterranean, before moving to Egypt in 
around 1600 bce. There, they were bound into slavery. Moses led 
their flight from Egypt into the Sinai desert, where they estab¬ 
lished the principles of their religion. Unlike other Near Eastern 
peoples, the Hebrews were monotheistic. Their worship centered 
on Yahweh, who provided Moses with the Ten Commandments, 
a set of ethical and moral rules. After 40 years, they returned to 
Canaan, which they named Israel. King David, who ruled until 


961 bce, seized the city of Jerusalem from the Canaanites, and 
began to construct buildings there worthy of a political and reli¬ 
gious capital for Israel, including a royal palace. His son, 
Solomon, completed a vast temple for worship, now known as the 
First Temple (fig. 2.24). The temple stood within a sacred precinct 
on Mount Moriah (the present-day Temple Mount), where, 
according to the scriptures, the patriarch Abraham had prepared 
to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Archaeological evidence for the massive 
building is controversial, and literary descriptions are incomplete. 
According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon covered the entire 
temple and the altar inside with gold. For the inner sanctuary, 
which held the Ark of the Covenant (a chest containing the 
Commandments), sculptors created two monumental cherubim 
(angels depicted as winged children) out of gilded olive wood. 
They also covered the walls with carvings of cherubim, palm 
trees, and flowers. Brass pillars stood at the front of the temple, 
with pomegranate-shaped capitals. King Hiram of Tyre 
(Phoenicia) is credited with providing resources for the construc¬ 
tion of the temple, such as materials and artisans, which is further 
evidence of the close connections between Near Eastern cultures. 

Babylonian forces under King Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed 
the temple in 587/86 bce, forcing the Israelites into exile. Upon 


40 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 















their return in 538, they built the temple anew, and under Herod 
the Great, king of Judea from 37 bce to 4 ce, the Second Temple 
was raised up and substantially enlarged. Roman soldiers razed 
this rebuilding in the reign of the emperor Vespasian, in the first 
century ce. The only vestige of the vast complex Herod commis¬ 
sioned is the western wall, known today as the Wailing Wall. 

IRANIAN ART 

Located to the east of Mesopotamia, Iran was a flourishing agri¬ 
cultural center in Neolithic times, starting in about 7000 bce. 
During that period, Iran became a gateway for migrating tribes

from the Asiatic steppes to the north as well as from India to the 
east. While it is distinctive, the art of ancient Iran still reflects its 
intersections with the cultures of Mesopotamia. 

Early Iranian Art 

The early nomadic tribes left no permanent structures or records, 
but the items they buried with their dead reveal that they ranged 
over a vast area—from Siberia to central Europe, from Iran to 
Scandinavia. They fashioned objects of wood, bone, or metal, and 
these diverse works share a common decorative vocabulary, 
including animal motifs used in abstract and ornamental ways. 
They belong to a distinct kind of portable art known as nomad’s 
gear, including weapons, bridles, buckles, fibulae (large clasps or 
brooches), and other articles of adornment, as well as various 
kinds of vessels. 

The handleless beaker in figure 2.25, dating to about 4000 bce, 
originates from a pottery-producing center at Susa on the Shaur 
River. On the surface of its thin shell of pale yellow clay, a brown 
glaze defines an ibex (mountain goat), whose forms the painter 
has reduced to a few dramatic sweeping curves. The circles of its 
horns reflect in two dimensions the cups three-dimensional 
roundness. Racing hounds above the ibex stretch out to become 
horizontal streaks, and vertical lines below the vessel’s rim are the 
elongated necks of a multitude of birds. This early example of 
Iranian art demonstrates the skill of the potter in both the con¬ 
struction of the cup and its sensitive painted design. It prefigures 
a later love of animal forms in the nomadic arts of Iran and 
Central Asia. 

The Persian Empire: Cosmopolitan Heirs 
to the Mesopotamian Tradition 

During the mid-sixth century bce, the small kingdom of Parsa 
to the east of lower Mesopotamia came to dominate the entire 
Near East. Under Cyrus the Great (r. 559-530/29 bce), ruler of 
the Achaemenid dynasty, the people of Parsa—the Persians— 
overthrew the king of the Medes, then conquered major parts 
of Asia Minor in ca. 547 or 546 bce, and Babylon in 538 bce. 
Cyrus assumed the title “king of Babylon,” along with the 
broader ambitions of Mesopotamian rulers. The empire he 
founded continued to expand under his successors. Egypt fell in 
525 bce, while Greece only narrowly escaped Persian domination 
in the early fifth century bce. At its height, under Darius I 
(r. 521-486 bce) and his son Xerxes (r. 485-465 bce), the territo¬ 
rial reach of the Persian Empire far outstripped the Egyptian and 
Assyrian empires combined. It endured for two centuries, during 
which it developed an efficient administration and monumental 
art forms. 

Persian religious beliefs related to the prophecies of Zoroaster 
(Zarathustra) and took as their basis the dualism of good and evil, 
embodied in Ahuramazda (Light) and Ahriman (Darkness). The 
cult of Ahuramazda focused its rituals on fire altars in the open 
air; consequently, Persian kings did not construct monumental

2.26 Palace of Darius and Xerxes, Persepolis. 518-460 bce 


religious architecture. Instead they concentrated their attention 
and resources on royal palaces, which were at once vast and 
impressive. 

PERSEPOLIS Darius I began construction on the most ambi¬ 
tious of the palaces, on a plateau in the Zagros highlands at Parsa 
or Persepolis, in 518 bce. Subsequent rulers enlarged it (fig. 2.26). 
Fortified and raised on a platform, it consisted of a great number 
of rooms, halls, and courts laid out in a grid plan. The palace is a 
synthesis of materials and design traditions from all parts of the 
far-flung empire; brought together, they result in a clear statement 
of internationalism. Darius boasts in his inscriptions that the 
palace timber came from Lebanon (cedar), Gandhara and 
Carmania (yaka wood), and its bricks from Babylon. Items for 
palace use (such as the golden rhyton, or ritual cup, in fig. 2.27), 
were of Sardian and Bactrian gold, Egyptian silver, and ebony, and 
Sagdianan lapis lazuli and carnelian. To work these materials, the 
Achaemenids brought in craftsmen from all over the empire, who

then took this international style away with them on returning 
to their respective homes. The gold-worker responsible for the 
rhyton shaped it as a senmurv, a mythical creature with the body 
of a lion sprouting griffin s wings and a peacock s tail. It belongs 
firmly to the tradition of Mesopotamian hybrid creatures. 

Visitors to the palace were constantly reminded of the theme 
of empire, beginning at the entrance. There, at the massive “Gate 
of All the Lands,” stood colossal winged, human-headed bulls, 
like the Assyrian lamassu (see fig. 2.18). Inside the palace, archi¬ 
tects employed columns on a magnificent scale. Entering the 217- 
foot-square Audience Hall, or apadana , of Darius and Xerxes, a 
visitor would stand amid 36 columns, which soared 40 feet up to 
support a wooden ceiling. A few still stand today (fig. 2.28). The 
concept of massing columns in this way may come from Egypt; 
certainly Egyptian elements are present in the vegetal (plantlike) 
detail of their bases and capitals. The form of the shaft, however, 
echoes the slender, fluted column shafts of Ionian Greece (see fig. 
5.8). Crowning the column capitals are “cradles” for ceiling 
beams composed of the front parts of two bulls or similar crea¬ 
tures (fig. 2.29). The animals recall Assyrian sculptures, yet their 
truncated, back-to-back arrangement evokes animal motifs of 
Iranian art, as seen in the form of the rhyton.

In marked contrast to the military narratives of the Assyrians, 
reliefs embellishing the platform of the Audience Hall and its 
double stairway proclaim a theme of harmony and integration 
across the multicultural empire (fig. 2.30). Long rows of marching 
figures, sometimes superposed in registers, represent the empire’s 
23 subject nations, as well as royal guards and Persian dignitaries. 
Each of the nations’ representatives wears indigenous dress and 
brings a regional gift—precious vessels, textiles—as tribute to the 


Persian king. Colored stone and metals applied to the relief added 
richness to a wealth of carved detail. The relief is remarkably shal¬ 
low, yet by reserving the figures’ roundness for the edge of their 
bodies (so that they cast a shadow), and by cutting the back¬ 
ground away to a level field, the sculptors created an impression 
of greater depth. Where earlier Mesopotamian reliefs depict fig¬ 
ures in mixed profile and frontal views, most of these figures are 
in full profile, even though some figures turn their heads back to

address those who follow. Through repetition of the walking 
human form, the artists generated a powerful dynamic quality 
that guides a visitor’s path through the enormous space. The rep¬ 
etition also lends the reliefs an eternal quality, as if preserving the 
action in perpetual time. If, as some believe, the relief represents 
the recurring celebration of the New Year Festival, this timeless 
quality would be especially apt. 

The Achaemenid synthesis of traditions at Persepolis demon¬ 
strates the longevity and flexibility of the Near Eastern language 
of rulership. The palace provides a dramatic and powerful setting 
for imperial court ritual on a grand scale. 

Mesopotamia Between Persian and 
Islamic Dominion 

Rebuffed in its attempts to conquer Greece, the Persian Empire 
eventually came under Greek and then Roman domination, but 
like many parts of the Greek and Roman empires, it retained 
numerous aspects of its own culture. The process began in 331 
bce with Alexander the Great’s (356-323 bce) victory over the 
Persians, when his troops burnt the palace at Persepolis in an act 
of symbolic defiance. After his death eight years later, his gener¬ 
als divided his realm among themselves, and Seleukas (r. 305-281 
bce) inherited much of the Near East. The Parthians, who were 
Iranian nomads, gained control over the region in 238 bce. 
Despite fairly constant conflict, they fended off Roman advances 
until a brief Roman success under Trajan in the early second cen¬ 
tury ce, after which Parthian power declined. The last Parthian 
king was overthrown by one of his governors, Ardashir or 
Artaxerxes, in 224 ce. This Ardashir (d. 240 ce) founded the 
Sasanian dynasty, named for a mythical ancestor, Sasan, who 


claimed to be a direct descendent of the Achaemenids, and this 
dynasty controlled the area until the Arab conquest in the mid¬ 
seventh century ce. 

Ardashir s son, Shapur I (r. 240-272 ce), proved to be Darius’ 
equal in ambition, and he linked himself directly to the Persian 
king. He expanded the empire greatly, and even succeeded in 
defeating three Roman emperors in the middle of the third cen¬ 
tury ce. Two of these victories Shapur commemorated in numerous 
reliefs, including an immense panel carved into rock at Naksh-i- 
Rustam, near Persepolis, where Darius I and his successors had 
previously located their rock-cut tombs (fig. 2.31). The victor, on 
horseback, raises his hand in a gesture of mercy to the defeated 
"barbarian,” who kneels before him in submission. This was a 
stock Roman scene, recognizable to Roman viewers, and this 
quotation gives the relief an ironic dimension, for the victorious 
Shapur here expropriates his enemy’s own iconography of 
triumph. Elements of style are typical of late or provincial Roman 
sculpture, such as the linear folds of the emperor’s billowing 
cloak. However, Shapur s elaborate headdress and clothing, his 
heavily caparisoned horse, and his composite pose are all dis¬ 
tinctly Near Eastern. 

Roman and Near Eastern elements are combined again in 
Shapur Is palace (242-272 ce) at Ctesiphon, near Baghdad, with 
its magnificent brick, barrel-vaulted audience hall, or iwan (fig. 
2.32). It was a Roman practice to exploit the arch to span huge 
spaces (see fig. 7.61), and the architect used it here to enclose 
a space 90 feet high, typical of the Near Eastern tradition of 
large-scale royal building. The registers of arched blank win¬ 
dows or blind arcades may derive from Roman facades, such as 
those in the stage buildings of theaters or ornamental fountains 
(see fig. 7.7). Yet the shallowness of the arcades creates a distinctly 



2.32 Palace of Shapur I, Ctesiphon, Iraq. 242-272 ce

eastern surface pattern, in turn subordinated to an awe-inspiring 
entryway. 

Metalwork continued to flourish in the Sasanian period, using 
a wide variety of techniques. Hunting scenes were a popular sub¬ 
ject, as seen in figure 2.33, a late fifth-century ce silver bowl that 
probably represents King Peroz I hunting gazelles. A metal¬ 
worker turned the bowl on a lathe, and hammered out the king 
and his prey from behind (a technique known as repousse), 
before applying gilt and inlaying details such as the horns of the 


animals and the pattern on the quiver, with niello, a compound of 
sulphur. The hunting subject continues a tradition known to 
Assyrians, as well as to Egyptians and Romans. Sasanians 
exported many of their wares to Constantinople (see map 8.1) and 
to the Christian West, where they had a strong impact on the art 
of the Middle Ages. Artists would manufacture similar vessels 
again after the Sasanian realm fell to the Arabs in the mid-seventh 
century ce, and these served as a source of design motifs for 
Islamic art as well (see Chapter 9).

Egyptian Art 


E gypt has long fascinated the west, the ancient Greeks and 

the Romans knew and admired Egypt, and Renaissance collectors and 
scholars took up their esteem. Napoleon s incursions into Egypt in the late 
eighteenth century brought artifacts and knowledge back to France and 
stimulated interest throughout Europe. European-sponsored excavations have been 


going on in Egypt since the nineteenth century, sometimes, as in 
the case of the discovery in 1922 of the tomb of King 
Tutankhamun, with spectacular results. 

One reason that ancient Egypt enthralls us is the exceptional 
technique and monumental character of its works of art. Most 
surviving objects come from tombs, which Egyptians built to 
assure an afterlife for the deceased. They intended the paintings, 
sculptures, and other objects they placed in the tombs to accom¬ 
pany the deceased into eternity. Thus, Egyptian art is an art of 
permanence. In fact, the fourth-century bce Greek philosopher 
Plato claimed that Egyptian art had not changed in 10,000 years. 
The reality is more complex, but it is fair to say that most 
Egyptian artists did not strive for innovation or originality, but 
adhered instead to traditional formulations that expressed specific 
ideas. Continuity of form and subject is a characteristic of ancient 
Egyptian art. 

Egyptian artists executed works of art mainly for the 
elite patrons of a society that was extremely hierarchical. 
Contemporary with the Egyptian development of writing around 
3000 bce there emerged a political and religious system that 
placed a god-king (called a pharaoh from the New Kingdom on) 
in charge of the physical and spiritual well-being of the land and 
its people. Many of the best-known works of Egyptian art exalted 

Detail of figure 3.41, The Weighing of the Heart and Judgment by Osiris 


these powerful rulers, and express the multifaceted ways that 
Egyptians envisioned their king: as a human manifestation of the 
gods, as a god in his own right, as a beneficent ruler, and as an 
emblem of life itself. Royal projects for the afterlife dominated the 
landscape and provided the model for elite burials. These two 
categories of art—royal commissions and funerary objects— 
constitute a large proportion of surviving Egyptian art. Religion 
accounts for the predominance of both types of art. 

Egyptian geography also played a formative role in the devel¬ 
opment of art. The land was established on the course of the Nile 
River in North Africa, exploiting the natural protection of the 
surrounding desert, or “red land.” The river floods annually, 
inundating the land on either side. As it recedes, the water leaves 
a dark strip of soil fertilized by silt. The Egyptians called this rich 
soil the “black land. ” They irrigated and farmed it, and regularly 
produced surplus food. This allowed them to diversify and 
develop a complex culture. Egypt’s agrarian society depended on 
the annual flooding of the Nile to survive. The king had to assure 
continuity of life through intercession with the gods, who often 
represented natural forces. (See Informing Art , page 52.) The chief 
deity was the sun, whom they worshiped as Ra-Horakhty. In 
matters concerning the afterlife, the deities Osiris, Isis, and Horus 
played key roles. Osiris was the mythical founder of Egypt, and 
Isis was his consort. Osiris’s brother Seth (god of chaos) mur¬ 
dered him, and having dismembered him, scattered his remains far 
and wide. Isis eventually recovered them, and reassembled them

between present-day Aswan and the point where the river fans 
out into the Delta, near present-day Cairo. Lower Egypt, in the 
north, consists mainly of the vast Delta, from ancient Memphis to 
the Mediterranean. In Upper Egypt, independent cities shared a 
rich culture that archaeologists know as Naqada II/III (from the 
location where they first discovered it). One of those cities was 
Hierakonpolis, where a number of well-constructed tombs con¬ 
tained valuable furnishings. In one, known as Tomb 100 and 
probably built for a ruler, paintings embellished the walls (fig. 
3.1). Human figures with rectangular torsoes, stick limbs, and 
simple round heads ride in boats, and engage in battle with one 
another. Unlike later Egyptian tomb paintings, the design is not 
arranged in registers (rows). A group of animals at the top sit on 
a ground-line, but the painter dispersed most of the figures freely 
against the background. In the lower left corner, a figure raises a 
stick against three smaller figures, who may be prisoners. This 
scheme will reappear in later Egyptian art (see fig. 3.2). 

With time, the culture of Upper Egypt spread northward, ulti¬ 
mately dominating the centers of Lower Egypt. Tradition main¬ 
tained that the first king of the first dynasty founded the city of 
Memphis, at the mouth of the Nile Delta, uniting Upper and 
Lower Egypt (map 3.1). The traditional division of Egypt into 
two distinct regions arises from the Egyptian worldview, which 
saw the world as a set of dualities in opposition: Upper and 
Lower Egypt; the red land of the desert and the black land of cul¬ 
tivation; the god of the earth (Geb) balanced by the sky (Nut); 
Osiris (god of civilization) opposed to Seth (god of chaos). The 
king had to balance the forces of chaos and order, and bring ma’at 
(harmony or order) to the world. Recognizing this worldview has 
led some scholars to question the traditional explanation that 
Upper and Lower Egypt were independent regions unified by 
King Narmer. Instead, they argue that this division was an imag¬ 
inative reconstruction of the past. 


to create the first mummy (an embalmed and wrapped body). From 
it she conceived her son, Horus, who avenged his father s death 
by besting Seth in a series of contests. Gods took many forms: Ra 
might appear as a falcon-headed man; Osiris as a mummy. 
Egyptians called the king himself the son of Ra and saw him as the 
human embodiment of Horus. As an equal to the gods, he con¬ 
trolled the land, the future, and the afterlife. A large priesthood, 
an administrative bureaucracy and a strong military assisted him. 

PREDYNASTIC AND 
EARLY DYNASTIC ART 

The origins of Egyptian culture stretch back into the Neolithic 
period. By at least 5000 bce, humans were growing crops and 
domesticating animals in the Nile Valley Settlements there grad¬ 
ually transformed into urban centers. 

According to tradition, Egypt initially consisted of two 
regions. Upper Egypt, in the south, includes the Nile Valley 


The Palette of King Narmer 

The Palette of King Narmer (fig. 3.2), dated to around 3000 bce, 
visually expressed the concept of the king as unifier. A palette is 
a stone tablet with a central depression for grinding the protective 
paint that Egyptians applied around their eyes to protect them 
from ailments and the suns glare. Its size—more than 2 feet 
high—suggests that it was not for ordinary use, but was probably 
reserved for a ceremony to ornament a cult statue. This ritual 
function may explain its findspot (where it was found) in the tem¬ 
ple of Hierakonpolis, where it had been buried along with other 
offerings to the god Horus. 

Shallow relief carvings in registers decorate both sides of the 
Palette. At the top of each side, in the center, hieroglyphs spell 
out Narmer s name, within an abstract rendering of the king s 
palace. The Egyptians developed hieroglyphs as a writing system 
at about the same time as the Mesopotamians were inventing 
cuneiform, and used them in both religious and administrative 
contexts. They called them “gods words”; the Greeks later saw 
them as sacred carvings, and their name for them, derived from

Egyptian Gods and Goddesses 



R eligion permeated every aspect of Egyptian life. According to 
Egyptian belief, the gods not only created the world, but remained 
involved in its existence. From artistic and textual evidence, we know 
the names of over 1,500 deities, some of whom are named below. The 
Egyptians conceived of their gods in myriad human, animal, and 
hybrid forms, and assigned numerous functions to them, which 
evolved over the course of time. 

AMUN: One of Egypt’s most important gods, associated with the sun, 
creation, and fertility. When combined with Ra as Amun-Ra in the 
Middle and New Kingdoms, he became the supreme Egyptian god. 
Usually represented as a man with a double plumed crown, a ram, or 
a human with a ram’s head. 

ANUBIS: God of the dead and embalming. Usually depicted as a jackal 
or another canine, or as a man with a jackal’s head. 

ATEN: A manifestation of the sun-god, supreme and only god under 
Akhenaten. Represented by the disk of the sun, emanating rays end¬ 
ing in hands. 

HAPY: God of the inundation of the Nile, associated with life-giving and 
creation. Usually represented as a man with a swollen belly. 

H ATHOR: One of Egypt’s most important goddesses. Mother or wife of 
Horus, wife or daughter and “Eye” of Ra, mother or wife of the king. 
Goddess of the sky, of women, female sexuality, and motherhood, of 
foreign lands, of the afterlife, and of joy, music, and happiness, and 
cow-goddess. Shown as a woman in a long wig or in a vulture cap with 
cow horns and a sun-disk, or as a cow. 

HORUS: God of the sky, of the sun, and of kingship, with whom the 
living king was associated. Son of Isis and Osiris. Represented as a 
falcon or hawk, or as a man with a falcon’s head. 


ISIS: Egypt’s most important goddess. Sister and wife of Osiris, mother 
and protector of Horus, and mother of the king. Cosmic goddess, 
goddess of magic, and protector of the dead. Usually represented as a 
woman crowned with the hieroglyphic throne sign, or with horns and 
a sun-disk. 

MA’AT: Personification of truth, justice, and order. Represented as a 
woman with a tall feather headdress, or as a feather. 

NEPHTHYS: Sister of Isis, funerary goddess. Represented as a woman. 
NUT: Personification of the heavens, associated with thunder, rain, and 
stars, and with resurrection. Mother of Isis, Osiris, Nephthys, and Seth. 
Usually shown as a woman, often with limbs or body extended across 
the sky. 

OSIRIS: One of Egypt’s chief deities. Ruler of the underworld, god of 
death, resurrection, and fertility, and associated with the king. 
Murdered and dismembered by his brother, Seth, he was reassembled 
by his consort Isis and sister Nephthys, and brought back to life. 
Represented as a white or black mummy, often wearing the white 
crown of Upper Egypt. 

RA: The most important Egyptian deity. Creator, king and father of the 
king. Combined with Ra-Horakhty as the morning sun. Often shown as 
a sun-disk surrounded by a cobra, or as a man with a hawk’s head and 
headdress with a sun-disk. 

SETH: Brother of Osiris and Isis, who murdered Osiris; brother and 
husband of Nephthys. Desert deity, associated chiefly with chaos, 
violence, and destruction. Represented as an animal with a curved 
head, or as a man with a curved animal head. 

THOTH: Moon-god, associated with writing and knowledge. 
Represented as an ibis, a baboon, or an ibis-headed man with a 
writing palette. 


the Greek words hieros (sacred) and gluphein (to carve), has 
endured. Flanking the hieroglyphs, heads of cows represent the 
sky goddess, locating the king in the sky. On one side of the 
Palette (shown on the left), King Narmer holds a fallen enemy by 
the hair, as he raises his mace—an emblem of kingship—with the 
other hand. The king appears in the composite view that will be 
the hallmark of Egyptian two-dimensional art: with a frontal view 
of eye, shoulders, and arms, but a profile of head and legs. He 
wears the white crown of Upper Egypt and from the belt of his 
kilt hangs the tail of a bull, a symbol of power that Egyptian kings 
would wear as part of their ceremonial dress for 3,000 years. The 
large scale of his figure compared with others immediately estab¬ 
lishes his authority. For his part, the enemy, like those in the 
bottom register, is stripped of clothing as an act of humiliation. 
Behind the king, and standing on his own ground-line, an 
attendant carries the king s sandals. Hieroglyphs identify both the 
sandal-carrier and the enemy. To the right of Narmer appears a 
falcon resting on a papyrus stand, which grows from a human¬ 
headed strip of land; the falcon holds a rope tethered to the face. 


On the other side of the Palette (on the right in fig. 3.2), 
Narmer appears in the highest register, now wearing the red 
crown of Lower Egypt. Flanked by the sandal-carrier and a long¬ 
haired figure, he follows four standard-bearers to inspect the 
decapitated bodies of prisoners, arranged with their heads 
between their legs. In the larger central register are two animals, 
each roped in by a male figure. They twist their long necks to 
frame a circle in the composition. The symmetrical, balanced 
motif may represent ma’at. Similar beasts occur on contemporary 
Mesopotamian cylinder seals, and may have influenced this 
design. In the lowest register, a bull representing the king attacks 
a city and tramples down the enemy 

The Palette communicates its message by combining several 
different types of signs on one object. Some of these signs—the 
king, attendants, and prisoners—are literal representations. 
Others are symbolic, such as the depiction of the king as a bull, 
denoting his strength. Pictographs, small symbols based on 
abstract representations of concepts, encode further information: 
In the falcon and papyrus group, the falcon represents Horus,

THE ANCIENT WORLD 




whom the Egyptians believed the king incarnated, while the 
human-headed papyrus stand represents Lower Egypt, where 
papyrus grew abundantly A possible interpretation is that this 
pictograph expresses Narmer s control of that region. Finally, the 
artist included identifying texts in the form of hieroglyphs. 
Together, the different signs on the Palette of King Narmer drive 
home important messages about the nature of Egyptian kingship: 
The king embodied the unified Upper and Lower Egypt, and 
though human, he occupied a divine office, as shown by the place¬ 
ment of his name in the sky, the realm of Horus. 

As Horus s manifestation on earth, the king provided a phys¬ 
ical body for the royal life force (ka) that passed from monarch to 
succeeding monarch. Positioned at the pinnacle of a highly strat¬ 
ified human hierarchy (indicated by his scale), the king was 
between mortals and gods, a kind of lesser god. His role was to 
enforce order over its opposing force, chaos, which he does on 
the Palette by overcoming foreign foes and establishing visible 
authority over them. 

THE OLD KINGDOM: A GOLDEN AGE 

The Palette of King Narmer offers an image of kingship that tran¬ 
scends earthly power, representing the king as a divinity as well as 
a ruler. The kings of the Old Kingdom (Dynasty Three to 
Dynasty Six, ca. 2649-2150 bce) found more monumental ways 
to express this notion. Other dynasties would emulate their 
works of art for the following two millennia. (See Informing Art , 
page 54.) 

Old Kingdom Funerary Complexes 

During the Old Kingdom, Egyptians fashioned buildings to 
house the day-to-day activities of the living mainly out of perish¬ 
able materials, with the result that little now survives. The bulk of 
archaeological evidence comes instead from tombs. The great 
majority of the population probably buried their dead in shallow 
desert graves, but the elite had the resources to build elaborate 
funerary monuments with luxury provisions for the afterlife. The 
survival of these tombs is no accident; they were purposely con¬ 
structed to endure. 

These structures had several important functions. As in many 
cultures, tombs gave the deceased a permanent marker on the 
landscape. They expressed the status of the dead and perpetuated 
their memory. Generally a rectangular mud-brick or stone edifice 
marked an early elite or royal burial (fig. 3.3), known today as a 
mastaba, from the Arabic word for “bench. ” Plaster covered its 
exterior sloping walls, which were painted to evoke a niched 
palace facade. Often this superstructure was solid mud brick or 
filled with rubble, but sometimes it housed a funerary chapel or 
storerooms for equipment needed in funerary rituals. These mon¬ 
uments also served a critical function in ensuring the preservation 
of a deceased individual s life force, or ka. Egyptians considered 
the ka to live on in the grave, and in order to do so, it required a 



3.3 Group of mastabas, 4th Dynasty (after A. Badawy) 


place to reside for eternity. This need led embalmers to go to great 
lengths to preserve the body through mummification (a process 
that they only perfected in the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties). 
The mummified body was usually placed within a sarcophagus (a 
stone coffin) and buried in a chamber at some depth below the 
mastaba, surrounded by subsidiary chambers for funerary appa¬ 
ratus. Egyptians believed that a statue could serve as a surrogate 
home for the ka in the event that the embalmers 5 efforts failed and 
the body decayed, so they set a sculpture within the burial cham¬ 
ber. They also equipped their tombs with objects of daily life for 
the ka s enjoyment. 

THE FUNERARY COMPLEX OF KING DJOSER Out of this 
tradition emerges the first known major funerary complex, that of 
the Third Dynasty King Djoser (Netjerikhet), at Saqqara (figs. 
3.4, 3.5, and 3.6), who ruled between 2630 and 2611 bce. On the 
west side of the Nile, Saqqara was the necropolis (cemetery or 
city of the dead) of the capital city of Memphis in Lower 
Egypt. Encircling the entire complex is a rectangular stone wall 
stretching over a mile in length and 33 feet high. The dominant 
feature of the complex is a stepped pyramid, oriented to the

Major Periods in Ancient Egypt 



I n Egyptian society, a king’s life was the measure of time. To organ¬ 
ize the millennia of Egyptian culture, scholars use a chronology 
devised in the third century bce by the priest-historian Manetho, who 
wrote a history of Egypt in Greek for Ptolemy I, based on Egyptian 
sources. He divided the list of Egyptian kings into 31 dynasties, begin¬ 
ning with the First Dynasty shortly after 3000 bce. Modern scholars 
have organized the dynasties into kingdoms, beginning with the Old 
Kingdom, which covers from ca. 2649 bce to 21 50 bce. The period 
before this, between prehistory and the First Dynasty, is known as the 
Predynastic period. Further subdivisions include the Middle Kingdom 
(ca. 2040-1640 bce) and the New Kingdom (ca. 1550-1 070 bce). 


Scholars still debate the actual dates for these broad periods and even 
for the reigns of kings, as Manetho’s list offered only a relative 
chronology (that is, the order in which kings succeeded one another) 
rather than absolute dates.

cardinal points of the compass (figs. 3.4 and 3.5). It began as a 26- 
foot-high mastaba, which the enclosure wall would originally 
have concealed. Over the course of years it rose to its towering 
204-foot height as builders added progressively diminishing lay¬ 
ers of masonry to its form. These layers resulted in the emergence 
of a kind of a staircase, perhaps the means by which the king 
could ascend to the gods after death. The treads of the “steps” 
incline downwards and the uprights outwards, giving the structure 
an impressively stable appearance. A chamber cut into the rock 
about 90 feet beneath the pyramid and lined with Aswan granite 
contained the burial, and additional chambers held funerary pro¬ 
visions. North of the pyramid was a labyrinthine funerary temple, 
where the living performed offering rituals for the dead king. 

The buildings in the burial complex reproduce the palace 
architecture inhabited by the king while alive. The niched 


enclosure wall evokes a palace facade. In the palace, large courts 
accommodated rituals of kingship; similarly, a large court to the 
south of the pyramid may have housed rituals for receiving trib¬ 
ute or asserting royal dominion. Shrines of Upper and Lower 
Egypt flanked a smaller oblong court to the east, which may have 
been the site of the serf-festival, a ceremony that celebrated the 
king s 30-year jubilee and rejuvenated his power. Unlike palace 
structures, however, many of the buildings in the funerary com¬ 
plex are nonfunctional: Of 14 gateways indicated in the enclosure 
wall, only one (on the southeast corner) allows entrance, while the 
rest are false doors. Likewise, chapels dedicated to local gods were 
simply facades with false doors, behind which was a fill of rubble, 
sand, or gravel. Furthermore, while architects chose perishable 
materials for palaces—primarily mud brick—they constructed the 
funerary complex entirely in limestone: It was built to last. All the

same, masons treated the durable limestone to mimick the perish¬ 
able fabrics of the palace: They dressed the limestone blocks of 
the enclosure wall to resemble the niched facades of mud-brick 
architecture. Additionally, the now reconstructed facade of a 
shrine echoes the form of an Upper Egyptian tent building, with 
tall poles supporting a mat roof that billows in the wind. Engaged 
columns imitate the papyrus stems or bundled reeds that 
Egyptian builders used to support mud-brick walls, with capitals 
shaped to resemble blossoms (fig. 3.6). Paint over the stone lintels 
disguised them as wood, and inside the tomb chamber, blue and 
green tiles covered false doors to imitate rolled-up reed matting. 

Many elements of the complex served as permanent settings 
for the dead king to perpetually enact rituals of kingship—rituals 
that maintained order among the living. The installation of a life- 
sized seated statue of the king in a serdab (an enclosed room 
without an entrance) to the east of the funerary temple assured his 
presence in the complex. Two holes in the serdab s front wall 
enabled his ka, residing in the statue, to observe rituals in his 
honor and draw sustenance from offerings of food and incense. 
The entire complex was oriented north-south, and the king s 
statue looked out toward the circumpolar stars in the northern 
sky. With these provisions, his ka would remain eternally alive 
and vigilant. 

Inscriptions on statue fragments found within the complex 
preserve the name of the mastermind behind its construction, a 


high official at Djoser s court and high priest of Ra named 
Imhotep. Egyptians in Imhotep s own time and beyond credited 
him with advancing Egyptian culture through his wisdom and 
knowledge of astronomy, architecture, and medicine; they 
regarded him so highly that they deified him. This complex, the 
first large-scale building constructed entirely in stone, preserves at 
least one of his legacies. Scholars often identify him as the first 
named architect in history. 

The Pyramids at Giza: 

Reflecting a New Royal Role 

Other kings followed Djosers lead, but during the Fourth 
Dynasty, ca. 2575-2465 bce, funerary architecture changed 
dramatically. To the modern eye, the most obvious change is the 
shift from a step pyramid to a smooth-sided one. A pyramid at 
Meidum attributed to Sneferu, the founder of the Fourth 
Dynasty underlines the deliberateness of the transformation. It 
was originally built as a step pyramid, but its steps were later 
filled in to produce smooth sides. 

The best-known pyramids are the three Great Pyramids at 
Giza (fig. 3.7), commemorating Sneferu s son, Khufu (the first and 
largest pyramid), Khafra (r. 2520-2494) (a somewhat smaller one), 
and Menkaure (r. 2490-2472) (the smallest pyramid). (See 
Materials and Techniques , page 56.) Throughout the ages since 


CHAPTER 3 EGYPTIAN ART 55 












MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Building the Pyramids 


I n spite of much research, many aspects of pyramid design remain a 
mystery to Egyptologists. Elevations of other types of building- 
palaces and pylons, for instance—are preserved on the walls of New 
Kingdom tombs and temples, and a few plans survive. Pyramid archi¬ 
tects may have worked from similar guidelines. Orienting the pyramids 
to the cardinal points of the compass appears to have been critical, 
and the architects probably achieved this by observing the stars. The 
greatest deviation is a meager 3 degrees east of north, in the pyramid 
of Djoser. 

During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, builders constructed a pyra¬ 
mid’s core out of local limestone. Quarries are still visible around the 
Great Pyramids and the Great Sphinx (fig. a and see fig. 3.9). For the 
casing (the outer surface), they must have brought Tura limestone and 
Aswan granite from quarries some distance away, as these are not 
local materials. Using copper tools, levers, and rope, workers cut chan¬ 
nels in the rock and pried out blocks averaging 1 i/to 5' in length but 
sometimes much larger. Somehow they hauled these blocks overland, 
on hard-packed causeways built for that purpose. Some scholars 
believe teams of men or oxen pulled them on sleds, basing this view 
primarily upon a tomb painting showing 1 72 men dragging a huge 
statue of the Twelfth Dynasty king Djehutihopte on a sled. When doc¬ 
umentary filmmakers tried to replicate the process using blocks of 
stone, it proved extraordinarily slow and cumbersome. Yet estimates 
of 2.3 million stone blocks in the pyramid of Khufu, constructed within 
23 years, suggest that quarries must have moved stone at tremendous 
rates: approximately 1,500 men had to produce at least 300 blocks a 
day. In Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple, late nineteenth century archae¬ 
ologist William Flinders Petrie discovered models of wooden cradles in 
the shape of a quarter-circle. If four cradles were fitted to the four 
sides of a block of stone, these frames would have allowed a small 
team of men to roll a block relatively quickly. 

Archaeological remains of pyramids indicate that methods of 
construction evolved over time. In early pyramids, builders used a but¬ 
tressing technique, with inclined layers around a central core, dimin¬ 
ishing in height from inside out (fig. b). They then set a smooth outer 
casing of cut stones at an angle to the ground. When this technique 
proved unstable at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty, architects 
turned to courses of stone, built up layer by layer. They designed outer 
casing blocks as right-angled trapezoids and set them level to the 
ground as the pyramid rose (fig. c). Scholars believe that workers con¬ 
structed ramps to raise blocks into place as the monument grew, but 
still debate the ramps’ design; since builders dismantled them after 
use, they have left little trace in the archaeological record. The sim¬ 
plest solution would be a linear ramp leading up to one face of the 
pyramid, made out of debris left over from building. As the pyramid 
grew, however, the slope would have become so steep that workers 
would have needed steps to haul the blocks up. At this point, they 
could only have maneuvered the blocks with levers. A spiraling ramp, 
which worked its way around the pyramid at a shallower incline, would 
have concealed the base corners of the pyramid, making calculations 
difficult for surveyors, and it would have been hard to construct at the 
highest levels. Another alternative is a ramp zigzagging up one side of 


the monument. One scholar proposes that workers used sand and 
rubble ramps for roughly the lowest sixth of the Great Pyramid, 
followed by stone ramps at the higher levels, resting on the 
untrimmed outer steps. As they removed the ramps, the builders 
would have smoothed out the outer casing blocks to form a slope.

their construction, the pyramids have continued to fascinate and 
impress (see The Art Historian's Lens , page 75.) Their lasting 
grandeur derives both from their sheer monumentality (Khafra s 
covers 13 acres at the base, and still rises to a height of about 450 
feet) and from their extraordinary simplicity. On a square plan, 
their four surfaces, shaped as equilateral triangles, taper up from 
the desert sand toward the sky. At any time of day one side will 
hold the suns full glare, while another is cast into shadow. Before 
Islamic builders plundered their stone, each pyramid was dressed 
with white limestone, preserved now only on the pinnacle of the 
pyramid of Khafra; at the tip of each, moreover, was a thin layer 
of gold. On Khafra s pyramid, a course of red granite set off the 
limestone s whiteness at ground level. The entrance to each pyra¬ 
mid was on its north face, and somewhere within the solid stone 
mass, rather than below ground, the architect concealed a burial 
chamber in the hopes of foiling tomb robbers (see fig. 3.3). 
Encircling each pyramid was an enclosure wall, and clustered all 
around were smaller pyramids and mastabas for members of the 
royal family and high officials. 

Like Djoser s complex at Saqqara and most subsequent royal 
burials, Fourth Dynasty burials took place on the Nile s west 
bank, the side of the setting sun, across from living habitations 
on the east bank (fig. 3.8). Yet in contrast to Djoser s complex, 
where the compact arrangement was laid out on a north-south 
axis, the architects at Giza set out the monuments on an extended 
east-west axis. At the start of the funeral ceremony attendants 
transported the body westward across the Nile. Once beyond 
the land under cultivation, the procession reached the valley 
temple, connected to the Nile by a canal. In the valley temple of 
Khafra is a central T-shaped hallway where floors of white calcite 
set off walls and pillars of costly red Aswan granite. Light cas¬ 
caded in through slits in the upper walls and the red granite roof. 


Beyond the valley temple, a raised and covered causeway led 
westward into the desert for about a third of a mile (0.2 km) to the 
funerary temple, adjoined to the pyramid s east face. Here an 
embalmer preserved the dead king s body and the living perpetu¬ 
ated the cult for his ka. Again, a rich variety of hard stone made 
for a vivid coloristic effect; relief sculptures probably added to the 
funerary temple s decoration, but most have perished over time. 
Next to the valley temple of Khafra stands the Great Sphinx, 
carved from an outcropping of rock left after quarrying stone 
(fig. 3.9). (Like pyramid, sphinx is originally a Greek term.) 
Uncomfortable with human representation in art, later Islamic 
residents of Giza damaged the massive sculpture, obscuring 
details of its face, and the top of the head is also missing. Still, 
scholars believe that the sculptors combined a portrait of Khafra 
(or possibly Khufu) with the crouching body (and thus strength) 
of a lion. Its vast scale also proclaims the king s power. 

The change in funerary architecture suggests a shift in the way 
Egyptians perceived their ruler. The smooth-sided pyramid was 
the shape of the ben-ben , a sacred stone relic in Heliopolis, center 
of the sun cult. These monumental tombs may therefore have 
emphasized the solar aspect of the king s person; indeed, the 
change in building practice coincides more or less with the king s 
adoption of the title “son of Ra. ” The change in orientation for 
the complexes also meant that the king s funerary temple did not 
face the northern stars, as before, but the rising sun in the east, 
which signified eternity through its daily rising and setting. In 
contrast to the funerary complex for Djoser (see figs. 3.4 and 3.5), 
the Giza complex contains no buildings for reenacting rituals of 
kingship. This suggests that the perpetual performance of these 
rituals was no longer the dead king s task. Now, his role was 
to rise to the sun-god on the suns rays, perhaps symbolized by 
the pyramids sloping sides, and to accompany him on his

Excerpt from the Pyramid Text 
of Unis (r. 2341-2311 bce) 

King U nis of the Fifth Dynasty built a pyramid at Saqqara on the walls 
of which were inscribed a series o fincantations and prayers for the a fter- 
life of the pharaoh. So-called Pyramid Texts such as these were placed in 
tombs throughout Egyptian history for both royal and nonroyal burials. 
Some of their formulas were adapted for different versions of the Book 
of the Dead. Though the earliest text to survive dates from about 
2320 BCE, the prayers may have been composed much earlier. 

The Resurrection of King Unis 

A pale sky darken, stars hide away, 

Nations of heavenly bowmen are shaken, 

Bones of the earth gods tremble— 

All cease motion, are still, for they have looked upon Unis, 
the King, 


Whose soul rises in glory, transfigured, a god, 

Alive among his fathers of old time, nourished by ancient mothers. 

The King, this is he! Lord of the twisty ways of wisdom 
(whose very mother knew not his name), 

His magnificence lights the black sky, 

His power flames in the Land of the Risen— 

Like Atum his father, who bore him; 

And once having born him, strong was the Son more than 
the Father! 

The Kas of the King hover about him; 

Feminine spirits steady his feet; 

Familiar gods hang over him; 

Uraei (cobras) rear from his brow; 

And his guiding Serpent precedes: 

“Watch over the Soul! Be helpful, O Fiery One! ” 

All the mighty companions are guarding the King!

endless cycle of regeneration. Texts in the form of chants or 
prayers inscribed on the interior walls of some later Old Kingdom 
pyramids express this conception of the role of the king vividly. 


The Primary Source text reproduced above, from the pyramid of

Representing the Human Figure 

In the hall in the valley temple of Khafra, a series of indentations 
in the paving show that 23 seated statues of the king once lined its 
walls. Archaeologists discovered one of these almost intact and six 
in poorer condition, interred in the temple floor. The best-preserved 
statue represents the seated king in a rigidly upright and frontal 
pose (fig. 3.10). This pose allowed him to watch—and thus take 
part in—rituals enacted in his honor; frontality gave him presence. 
Behind him, the falcon Horus spreads his wings protectively 
around his head. Like the Palette of King Narmer , this sculpture 
neatly expresses qualities of kingship. Horus declares the king his 
earthly manifestation and protege, and the king s muscular form 
indicates his power. The smooth agelessness of the latter s face 
bespeaks his eternal nature, while the sculpture s compact form 
gives it a solidity that suggests permanence. The intertwined plants 
—papyrus and perhaps sedge—carved between the legs of his chair

are indigenous to both Lower and Upper Egypt, indicating the 
territorial reach of royal authority and the unity of the land. Even 
the stone used for his image expresses the king s control of distant 
lands: Diorite came from the deserts of Nubia. A hard stone, it lends 
itself to fine detail and a high polish, and the strong Egyptian light 
pouring in through the temple s louvered ceiling and reflected off 
the white calcite pavement must have made the figure glisten.

sents King Menkaure and his chief wife Khamerernebty II (fig. 
3.11). It shares important features with the statue of Khafra. 
Carved in one piece with an upright back slab, it exhibits a similar 


CHAPTER 3 EGYPTIAN ART 59 



rigid frontality. One reason for this may have been the sculpture s 
intended location and function. This group, too, may have come 
from the king s valley temple. 

The artist depicted Menkaure and his queen with several char¬ 
acteristics in common. Of almost identical height, both are frozen 
in a motionless stride with the left foot forward. Though the king 
is more muscular than Khamerernebty, and though she is draped 
in a thin dress hemmed at her ankles while he is half nude, smooth 
surfaces and a high polish characterize both bodies. Menkaure s 
headdress even echoes the form of Khamerernebty s hair. These 
common qualities establish an appearance of unity, and the 
queen s embrace further unifies the pair. 

In some cases, traces of paint show that sculptors added details 
to their work in color, though whether they always painted stat¬ 
ues carved in high-quality hard stone is hard to assess. A pair of 
Fourth Dynasty sculptures from a mastaba tomb at Meidum are 
carved from limestone, which is softer than diorite and does not 
yield such fine surface detail (fig. 3.12). Here, the artist painted 


skin tones, hair, garments, and jewelry, using the standard con¬ 
vention of a darker tone for a male, a lighter tone for a female. 
Rock-crystal pupils so animate the eyes that, in later years, fear¬ 
ful robbers gouged the eyes out of similar figures before looting 
the tombs they occupied. Inscriptions identify this pair as 
Rahotep and his wife Nofret, and describe their social status: He 
is a government official and she is a “dependent of the king. ” Like 
the royal portraits, these figures are represented with ritualized 
gestures and in full frontality. 

This rigid frontality is the norm for royal and elite sculptures 
in the round. In relief and painting, there is also a remarkable con¬ 
sistency in stance among royal and elite subjects. The standard 
pose, as illustrated on the Palette ofKingNarmer(see fig. 3.2) and 
on a wooden stele found in the mastaba of a court official of 
Djoser, Hesy-ra, at Saqqara (fig. 3.13), is altogether nonnatural- 
istic. In the case of the latter, frontal shoulders and arms and a 
frontal kilt combine with a profile head (with a frontal eye) and 
legs; the figure has two left feet, with high arches and a single toe.

The representation is conceptual or intellectual rather than visual: 
The artist depicts what the mind knows, not what the eye sees. 
This artificial stance contributes to the legibility of the image, but 
it also makes the figure static. 

THE CANON Body proportions are also consistent enough in 
royal and elite sculpture in the round and in relief and painting to 
suggest that artists relied on guidelines for designing the human 
image. In fact, traces of such guidelines are still visible on reliefs 
and paintings. This canon (set of rules) began in the Fifth 
Dynasty with a grid superimposed over the human image: One 
vertical line ran through the body at the point of the ear, and as 
many as seven horizontal lines divided the body according to a 
standard module. Over time, the guidelines changed, but the prin¬ 
ciple of the canon remained: Although body-part measurements 
might vary from person to person, the relationship between parts 
remained constant. With that relationship established, an artist 
could make a human portrait at any scale, taking the proportions 
of body parts from copybooks. Unlike later systems of perspec¬ 
tive, where a figure s size suggests its distance from a viewer, in the 
Egyptian canon size signaled social status. 

For elite male officials, there were two kinds of ideal image, 
each representing a different life stage. One is a youthful, physi¬ 
cally fit image, like that of Hesy-ra (see fig. 3.13). In the other, a 
paunch, rolls of fat, or slack muscles, and signs of age on the face 
indicate maturity. A painted limestone figure of a scribe, perhaps

named Kay, from his mastaba at Saqqara, is an example of the sec¬ 
ond type (fig. 3.15). He is depicted rigidly upright and frontal but, 
unlike Hesy-ra, his body shows signs of slackening, in the sallow 
cheeks, sagging jaw, and loose stomach. Since Egyptian society 
was mostly illiterate, a scribe had high status; indeed, the artist 
depicted the figure seated on the floor in the act of writing, the 
very skill in which his status resided. The image reinforces his 
social status: It shows an official who has succeeded in his career, 
eats well, and relies on subordinates to do physical work on 
his behalf. 

These conventions of pose, proportion, and appearance 
applied only to the highest echelons of society—royalty and 
courtiers. By contrast, the lower the status of the subject, the 
more relaxed and naturalistic their pose. Once the conventions 
were established, ignoring them could even result in a change of 
meaning for a figure, especially a change of status, from king or 
official to servant or captive. Fine low-relief paintings in the tomb 
chapel of Ti, a high official during the Fifth Dynasty, at Saqqara 
encapsulate the correlation between rank and degree of natural¬ 
ism neatly (fig. 3.16). In one section, Ti stands on a boat in a 
thicket of papyrus, observing a hippopotamus hunt. He stands 


CHAPTER 3 EGYPTIAN ART 61 















































































































































rigidly in the traditional composite view, legs and head in profile, 
torso and eye frontal, while hunters, shown on a smaller scale, 
attack their prey from a second boat in a variety of active poses 
that more closely resemble nature. Zigzagging blue lines beneath 
the boats denote the river, where hippopotami and fish—on the 
lowest rung of the natural world—swim about in naturalistic 
poses. Similarly, nesting birds and predatory foxes freely inhabit 
the papyrus blossoms overhead. 

PAINTINGS AND RELIEFS Like statues in tombs, paintings 
and reliefs played a role in the Egyptian belief system. Images such 
as Ti Watching a Hippopotamus Hunt (see fig. 3.16) allowed the 
deceased to continue activities he or she had enjoyed while alive. 
They also functioned on metaphorical levels. The conquest of 
nature, for instance, served as a metaphor for triumph over death. 
Death was the realm of Osiris, as god of the underworld, and so 
were the life-giving waters of the Nile, because of his regeneration 
after Seth had murdered him. Osiris was the god of fertility and 
resurrection, to whom Egyptians could liken the deceased. And, 
because Isis hid Horus in a papyrus thicket to protect him from 
Seth, they saw a papyrus stand as a place of rebirth, much like the 
tomb itself. Traditionally, too, a boat was the vehicle that carried 
the ka through its eternal journey in the afterlife. By contrast, 
Egyptians viewed the crop-destroying hippopotamus as an animal 
of evil and chaos, and so as the embodiment of the destructive Seth, 
lord of the deserts. Thus, meanings specific to its funerary context 
may have encoded the entire painting. Other Old Kingdom tomb 
paintings depict family members buried alongside the principal 
tomb owner, or as company for the ka in the afterlife. Some scenes 
depict rituals of the cult of the dead (that is, rituals in honor of the 
dead), or portray offerings and agricultural activities designed to 
provide the ka with an eternal food supply. In these scenes, the 
deceased typically looks on, but does not participate. 


THE MIDDLE KINGDOM: 

REASSERTING TRADITION 
THROUGH THE ARTS 

The central government of the Old Kingdom disintegrated with 
the death of the Sixth Dynasty king Pepy II in around 2152 bce. 
This led to the turbulent First Intermediate Period, which lasted 
over a century and when local or regional overlords fostered 
antagonisms between Upper and Lower Egypt. The two regions 
reunited in the Eleventh Dynasty, as King Nebhepetra 
Mentuhotep or Mentuhotep II (ca. 2061-2010 bce) gradually 
reasserted regal authority over all of Egypt. The late Eleventh, 
Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties make up the Middle Kingdom 
(ca. 2040-1640 bce), when much of the art deliberately echoed 
Old Kingdom forms, especially in the funerary realm. The art 
asserted continuity with the golden days of the past. Sculptures of 
some members of the royal family, however, also show breaks 
with tradition. 


Royal Portraiture: 

Changing Expressions and Proportions 

A fragmentary quartzite sculpture of Senwosret III (r. 1878-1841 
bce) indicates a rupture with convention in the representation of 
royalty (fig. 3.17). Rather than sculpting a smooth-skinned, ideal¬ 
ized face, untouched by time—as had been done for over 1,000 
years—the artist depicted a man scarred by signs of age. His brow 
creases, his eyelids droop, and lines score the flesh beneath his 
eyes. Scholars have described the image as “introspective,” and 
reading it against the background of Senwosret Ills troubled 
campaign of military expansion in Nubia to the south, they see 
the portraits physical imperfections as reflections of the king s 
stress. Facial expressions or signs of age, however, can signify dif¬ 
ferent things to different societies, and it is equally likely that the 
tight-lipped expression reflects a new face of regal authority, pro¬ 
jecting firm resolve. Sculptors of this time tended to combine the 
aged face with a body that was still youthful and powerful. 

As facial expressions became more naturalistic in royal images 
of this time, so the canon of proportions changed too. This is 
clear if we compare the Old Kingdom sculpture of Queen 
Khamerernebty (see fig. 3.11) with a sculpture of Lady Sennuwy 
(fig. 3.18), the wife of a provincial governor, found at Kerma in 
Upper Nubia. Depictions of women during the Middle Kingdom

Funerary Architecture 

Burial patterns among court officials and other members of the 
elite stayed relatively constant during the Middle Kingdom, with 
most choosing interment in sunken tombs and mastabas. Already 
known in the Old Kingdom, rock-cut tombs were especially pop¬ 
ular at this time. Fine examples still exist at Beni Fiasan, the 
burial place of a powerful ruling family of Middle Egypt in the 
Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasties (fig. 3.19). The tombs were hol¬ 
lowed out of a terrace of rock on the east bank of the Nile and 
offered stunning views across the river. Inside, a vestibule led to a 
columned hall and burial chamber, where a niche framed a statue 
of the deceased (fig. 3.20). As in Old Kingdom tombs, paintings 
and painted relief decorated the walls. The section illustrated in 
figure 3.21, from the restored tomb of Khnum-hotep, shows 
workers restraining and feeding oryxes (a type of antelope 
trapped in the desert and raised in captivity as a pet). 

As in the Old Kingdom, tomb owners believed the paintings 
provided nourishment, company, and pastimes for the dead. The 
living placed a wide variety of objects in tombs along with the 
dead, including objects made of faience, a glass paste fired to a 
shiny opaque finish. The figurine shown in figure 3.22 came from 
a tomb in Thebes, and represents a schematized woman. Fier legs 
stop at the knees, possibly to restrict her mobility, or because legs 
were not essential to her function. The artist delineated her 
breasts and pubic area, and painted a cowrie-shell girdle to 
emphasize her belly and hips. Fier function may have been as a 
fertility object, to enhance family continuity among the living and 
regeneration of the dead into a new life in the beyond. Egyptians 
associated the blue-green color of the faience with fertility, regen¬ 
eration, and the goddess Fiathor.

Often, the living buried jewelry with the deceased. Egyptians 
used jewelry widely, for daily personal adornment, for formal 
occasions such as court audiences, to bedeck cult statues, and to 
protect mummies. Many of the surviving pieces show extraordi¬ 
nary technological skill on the part of the jewelers. In the pyramid 
complex at Dahshur, the tomb of Mereret, a royal woman at the 
court of Senwosret III, contained two valuable pectorals, or large 
pendants. One is designed as a shrine with lotus-capital columns, 
within which two sphinxes trample enemies underfoot. With one 
raised forepaw, they support a cartouche of the king s name (fig. 
3.23). A vulture spreads its wings overhead. In wearing the pec¬ 
toral, Mereret broadcast Senwosret s power to overcome foes and 
assert order. At the same time, the pectoral expressed royal 
wealth: The jeweler fashioned it in cloisonne (a metalworking 
technique often used for enamel), using a gold framework for 
valuable stones brought from afar: carnelian from the eastern 
desert, turquoise from Sinai, and lapis lazuli from present-day 
Afghanistan. As a mummy ornament, the pectoral may have 
offered protection against malevolent forces.

The stability of the Middle Kingdom was not to last. As cen¬ 
tral authority weakened after about 1785 bce, local governors 
usurped power. During the Twelfth Dynasty, immigrants from 
Palestine known as the Hyksos (a Greek rendering of the 
Egyptian for “rulers of foreign lands”) moved into the Nile Delta, 
gaining control of the area and forcing the king southward to 
Thebes. The era of their control is known as the Second 
Intermediate Period. 

THE NEW KINGDOM: 

RESTORED GLORY 

The first king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Ahmose (r. 1550-1525 
bce), finally expelled the Hyksos from Egypt. The 500 years after 
their expulsion—covering the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and 
Twentieth Dynasties—are designated the New Kingdom. They 
constitute a time of renewed territorial expansion and tremendous 
prosperity for Egypt, and a time when the arts flourished. 
Tremendous architectural projects were accomplished along the 
full length of the Nile, centering on the region of Thebes (present- 
day Luxor). Of these projects, many of the secular buildings, 
including palaces and forts, were made of mud brick and have 
perished. Stone tombs and temples, however, retain a measure of 
their former glory. 

Royal Burials in the Valley of the Kings 

Changes in burial practices expose a major difference between the 
Old Kingdom and the New Having witnessed the loss of order 
that allowed plundering of royal burials, Eighteenth Dynasty 
kings abandoned the practice of marking their tombs with pyra¬ 
mids. Instead, they excavated tombs out of the rock face in the 
Valley of the Kings west of Thebes, and their entrances were 
concealed after burial. Excavations have revealed that in these 
tombs a corridor led deep into the rock to a burial chamber 
flanked by storage rooms. Decorating the burial chamber were 
paintings of the king with Osiris, Anubis, and Hathor, funerary 
deities who assured his passage from this world to the next. 
Rituals of the funerary cult took place away from the tomb, over 
a rocky outcropping to the east, at a temple on the edge of the 
land under cultivation. 

HATSHEPSUT’S TEMPLE The best-preserved example of a 
New Kingdom funerary temple is that of the female king 
Hatshepsut (ca. 1478-1458 bce) (fig. 3.24). Hatshepsut was the 
chief wife—and half-sister—of Thutmose II. On his death in 1479 
bce, power passed to Thutmose III, his young son by a minor 
wife. Designated regent for the young king, Hatshepsut ruled 
with him as female king until her death in 1458 bce. She justified 
her unusual rule by claiming that her father, Thutmose I, had 
intended her to be his successor. 

Nestled in the cliffside at Deir el-Bahri, Hatshepsut s 
temple sat beside the spectacular Eleventh Dynasty temple of 


CHAPTER 3 EGYPTIAN ART 65 



















3.24 Temple of Hatshepsut, Deir el-Bahri. ca. 1478-1458 bce 


Mentuhotep II (fig. 3.25), who had reunited Egypt over 500 years 
earlier during the Middle Kingdom. Senenmut, the architect who 
designed Hatshepsut s temple, may have modeled some of its 
features after this earlier temple, with its crowning pyramid or 
mastaba and terraces extending into the cliff face. Hatshepsut s 
temple is a striking response to its physical setting. Its ascending 
white limestone courts, linked by wide ramps on a central axis, 
echo the desert s strong horizontal ground-line and the clifftop 
above. Meanwhile, the bright light and shadows of the colonnades 
create a multitude of vertical lines that harmonize with the fis¬ 
sures of the cliff. With its clean contours, the royal structure 
imposes order on the less regularized forms of nature, just as the 
king s role was to impose order on chaos. At the time of its con¬ 
struction, a causeway led from a valley temple by the Nile to the 
funerary temple. Trees lined the entrance way, and paired 
sphinxes faced each other. Cut into the rock at the farthest reach 
of the temple was the principal sanctuary, dedicated to Amun-Ra, 
god of the evening sun. Smaller chapels honored Anubis, god of 
embalming, and Hathor, goddess of the west. An altar dedicated 
to Ra-Horakhty stood on the upper terrace. 

Throughout the complex, painted relief sculptures brought 
the walls to life, describing battles, a royal expedition to the land 
of Punt in search of myrrh trees for the terraces, and scenes of

Thutmose I legitimizing his daughter s rule. Sculptures of the king 
and deities abounded. One of eight colossal red-granite statues 
from the third court (fig. 3.26) depicts Hatshepsut kneeling as she 
makes an offering of two spherical jars. An inscription on the base 
records that the king is presenting ma’at (order) to Amun. Since 
kingship was a male office, she wears the regalia of a male king: a 
kilt, a false beard, and the nemes headdress, the striped cloth 
worn by kings. Although she is visibly female in some images, in 
this and many others she is depicted without breasts. 

Sometime after Hatshepsut s demise, Thutmose III (r. 1479- 
1425) constructed his own temple between his mothers and 
Mentuhoteps, with the purpose of eclipsing Hatshepsut s. He 
designated his own temple as the destination of the divine boat 
carrying the statue of Amun in the Festival of the Wadi, held at 


Deir el-Bahri. At some point after Hatshepsut s death, the uraeus 
cobras were meticulously removed from the granite sphinxes and 
seated statues at her mortuary complex. Perhaps the intention was 
to repudiate her royal descent. By the forty-second year of 
Thutmose Ills reign, a more systematic elimination of her images 
and removal of her name from inscriptions was underway. 
Workmen smashed her statues and buried the fragments in two 
pits in front of the temple complex. Still, Hatshepshut s temple 
remains a monument to her memory. Archaeologists have 
recently identified an obese mummified body in an unmarked 
tomb in the Valley of the Kings as her mortal remains. 

Temples to the Gods 

Besides building their own funerary temples, Eighteenth Dynasty 
kings expended considerable resources on temples to the gods, 
such as the Theban divine triad: Amun, his consort Mut, and their 
son Khons. At Karnak and nearby Luxor, successive kings built 
two vast temple complexes to honor this triad, and on special fes¬ 
tivals divine boats conveyed the gods’ images along waterways 
between the temples. 

THE TEMPLE OF AMUN-RA At the Temple of Amun-Ra 
(a manifestation of the god Amun) at Karnak, a vast wall encircled 
the temple buildings (fig. 3.27). Entering the complex, a visitor 
walked through massive pylons, or gateways built as monuments 
to individual kings (and sometimes dismantled as building pro¬ 
ceeded over the years). As a ceremonial procession moved within 
the buildings, these pylons marked its progress deeper and deeper 
into sacred space. Within the complex, a vast hypostyle hall 
(room with many columns) was the farthest point of access for all 
but priests and royalty (fig. 3.28). Here, a forest of columns would 
awe the mind, their sheer mass rendering the human form almost 
insignificant. The architect placed the columns close to one 
another to support a ceiling of stone lintels which had to be 
shorter than wooden lintels to prevent them from breaking under 
their own weight. Nevertheless, the columns are far heavier than 
they needed to be, with the effect that a viewer senses the 
overwhelming presence of stone all around—heavy, solid, and 
permanent. Beyond the hall, a sacred lake allowed the king and 
priests to purify themselves before entering the temple proper. 
They proceeded through smaller halls, sun-drenched courts, and 
processional ways decorated with obelisks, tall stone markers 
topped by pyramid-shaped points, and chapels where they would 
pause to enact ceremonies. Every day the priests would cleanse 
and robe the images of the gods, and offer sacred meals to 
nourish them. The king and the priests conducted these rituals 
away from the public eye, with the result that they gained power 
for being shrouded in mystery. 

Essential to the temple s ritual functioning was its metaphori¬ 
cal value: It symbolized the world at its inception. The columns 
of the hypostyle hall represented marsh plants in stylized form: 
Their capitals emulated the shape of papyrus flowers and buds— 
so that the building evoked the watery swamp of chaos out of 


CHAPTER 3 EGYPTIAN ART 67 













3.27 Reconstruction drawing of Temple of Amun-Ra, Karnak, Thebes 

which the mound of creation emerged. The temple was thus the 
king s exhortation in stone to the gods to maintain cosmic order. 

Throughout the complex, a distinctively Egyptian form of 
decoration covered the pylons and hall and enclosure walls: sunken 
relief. In this technique, the sculptor cut sharp outlines into the 
stone s face, and modeled the figures within the outlines, below 
the level of the background, rather than carving away the surface 
around figures to allow them to emerge from the stone. Light 
shining onto the stone s surface then cast shadows into the out¬ 
lines, animating the figures without compromising the solid planar 
appearance of the wall. This type of relief was especially popular 
for decorating hard stone, since it required less carving away. 

The subject of the reliefs at Karnak was the king s relationship 
with the gods. In one section, from the north exterior wall of the 
hypostyle hall, an upper register shows Seti I sacking the Hittite 
city of Kadesh on the Orontes River, and, in a lower register, his 
Libyan campaign (fig. 3.29). Following convention, the king and 
his horse-drawn chariot are frozen against a background filled with 
hieroglyphs and soldiers, whose smaller scale glorifies the king s 
presence. The figures of the king and his horse are also cut more 
deeply than surrounding figures, resulting in a bolder outline. The 
king s might and the ruthless efficiency of his forces seem to assure 
victory, although neither battle was, in fact, decisive. Through his 
conquest of foreign forces, the king established order, ma’at.

ABU SIM BEL Seti Is son, Ramesses II, ruled for 67 years 
during the Nineteenth Dynasty (ca. 1290-1224 bce). He commis¬ 
sioned more architectural projects than any other Egyptian king, 
including a monumental temple dedicated to himself and Amun, 
Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, carved into the sandstone at Abu Simbel 
on the west bank of the Nile (fig. 3.30). Location alone made an 
eloquent statement: With the temple, the king marked his claim to 
the land of Kush in Lower Nubia, which was the origin of pre¬ 
cious resources of gold, ivory, and animal pelts. A massive rock 
facade substitutes for a pylon, where four huge seated statues of 
the king almost 70 feet high flank the doorway dwarfing any 
approaching visitor. Between the statues’ legs, small figures repre¬ 
sent members of the royal family A niche above the entrance 
holds an image of Amun, who is shown as a falcon-headed figure 
crowned by a sun disk. Planking this deeply carved sculpture are 
sunk-relief depictions of Ramesses holding out a statue of the

goddess of order, Ma’at, to the god. The image thus demonstrates 
the king s role as keeper of terrestrial order at the gods 5 request. 
On the interior of the temple are more colossal figures of 
Ramesses, shaped from the same rock as the columns behind 
them. Their size (32 feet high) and frontality presented an awe¬ 
inspiring sight to priests who conducted rituals inside (fig. 3.31). 

Ramesses commissioned a second, complementary temple 
about 500 feet away from his own, in honor of his wife, Nefertari, 
and Hathor. Here, too, sculptors cut figures into the rock as a 
facade for the temple, which, though colossal in scale, was signif¬ 
icantly smaller than Ramesses’ temple. The topographical rela¬ 
tionship between the two temples may be significant. Their 
central axes, when extended forward, intersected in the Nile s 
life-giving waters, so their locations may express the generative 
force embodied in the royal couple. This relationship has hardly 
been visible since the 1960s, when engineers moved the temple of 
Ramesses upward nearly 700 feet to raise it above flood levels 
resulting from the construction of the Aswan Dam. 

Block Statues 

In the New Kingdom, a type of sculpture known since the late 
Old Kingdom experienced fresh popularity. This was the block 
statue, where the artist reduced the body, shown seated on the 


ground with knees drawn up to the chest and wrapped in a 
cloak, to a cubic abstraction. Above the block is a portrait head, 
and feet protrude at the bottom; sometimes arms are folded 
across the knees. Like the more conventional full-body sculp¬ 
tures, these images functioned as seats for the ka in tombs. When 
they first appear in the Sixth Dynasty, the figures are found in 
model funerary boats, transporting the dead to the cult center of 
Osiris at Abydos. They may, therefore, represent the deceased as 
a being sanctified by this journey in the afterlife. The example 
illustrated in figure 3.32 may come from the temple at Karnak. It 
presents two portraits. Above is the head of Senenmut, a high 
official at the court of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and master 
of works for the temple at Deir el-Bahri. Below Senenmut s head 
is a very small head, portraying Nefrua, daughter of Hatshepsut 
and Thutmose II. Featuring the sidelock of hair that identifies 
her as a child, her head emerges from the block in front of 
Senenmut s face, as if held in an embrace, perhaps reflecting his 
protective role as her tutor. Omitting anatomical features in favor 
of the block form left an ample surface for a hieroglyphic text of 
prayers or dedications.

Images in New Kingdom Tombs 

New Kingdom artists continued to paint tomb chapels with 
scenes similar to those in Old and Middle Kingdom tombs. In the 
New Kingdom, however, additional images showed the deceased 
worshiping deities whose interventions could ease their transition 
to the next world—most typically, Osiris and Anubis. In the 
tomb chapel that featured in the annual festival of the Wadi at 
Thebes, when the living crossed to the west bank of the Nile and 
feasted with the dead, artists also painted banquet scenes. Music, 
dance, and wine were sacred to Hathor, who could lead the dead 
through the dangerous liminal phase between death and the after¬ 
life. A fragment of painting from the Tomb of Nebamun at 
Thebes (ca. 1350 bce) shows that painters still employed hierar¬ 
chical conventions established in the Old Kingdom 1,000 years 
previously (fig. 3.33). While elite diners sit in rigid composite 
view (half profile, half frontal) in an upper register, musicians and 
dancers below move freely in pursuit of their crafts. A flute player 
and a clapper have fully frontal faces, and they even turn the soles 
of their feet to face a viewer—an extreme relaxation of elite behav¬ 
ior. The nude dancers twist and turn, and the loosened, separated 


strands of the entertainers’ long hair further animate their painted 
images. The freedom of movement inherent in these figures has 
suggested to some that works from contemporary Crete may 
have been available for these painters to study. Art historians have 
gone so far as actually to attribute paintings elsewhere to artists 
from this Aegean island culture. 

New Kingdom artists and patrons also followed Middle and 
Old Kingdom precedents in designing sculpted tomb images. 
Some reliefs executed for an unfinished tomb in Thebes belonging 
to Ramose, vizier for Amenhotep III (ca. 1375 bce), depict 
Ramose s brother, Mai, and his wife, Urel (fig. 3.34). The relief is 
shallow, but the carving distinguishes different textures with great 
mastery. The composite postures and the gestures of the wife 
embracing her husband reflect conventions going back at least to 
the Old Kingdom; all the same, the canon of proportions differs 
from earlier representations, and some of the naturalism seen in 
other New Kingdom works informs the profiles of this couple. 
The united front that husband and wife present through eternity 
may be compared to a New Kingdom love song that extols the joy 
of spending “unhurried days” in the presence of ones beloved.

AKHENATEN AND 
THE AMARNA STYLE 

Amenhotep III, whom Ramose served as vizier, raised the level of 
devotion to the sun-god during his reign (1391 -1353 bce). In tem¬ 
ple complexes at Karnak and elsewhere, the king established wide 
open-air courtyards where Egyptians could worship the sun in its 
manifestation as a disk (or Aten) in the sky. Aten worship 
increased dramatically under his son, Amenhotep IV, who 
stressed the suns life-giving force and began to visualize the god 
not in the traditional guise of a falcon-headed figure, but as a disk 
that radiated beams terminating in hands. Enraged by the young 
kings monotheistic vision of Aten, a powerful conservative 
priesthood thwarted his attempts to introduce this new cult to 
traditional religious centers such as Thebes. In response, 
Amenhotep IV established a new city devoted entirely to Aten on 
the Nile s east bank in central Egypt. He named his new city 
Akhetaten (now known as Amarna), meaning “horizon of Aten,” 
and changed his own name to Akhenaten, “beneficial to Aten.” 
Akhenaten s belief in Aten as the source of life found expression 
in the “Hymn to Aten” which is sometimes attributed to the king. 
This text (see www.myartslab.com) expresses joy in the daily 
rising of the sun by describing the world coming back to life at its 
appearance. Akhenaten s new cult and fledgling city lasted only as 
long as its founder; after his death, his opponents razed the city to 
the ground. Still, archaeological remains suggest that Akhenaten 
built temples in the contemporary style, using massive pylons and 
obelisks, as at Karnak, but with an emphasis on open-air courts 
directly exposed to the suns glare. 


The Amarna Style 

Sculptures of Akhenaten and his family break dramatically with 
long-established conventions for depicting royal subjects. In 
numerous depictions, the figure of Akhenaten exhibits radically 
different proportions from those of previous kings. A colossal fig¬ 
ure of Akhenaten installed at the temple of Amun-Ra in Karnak 
between 1353 and 1335 represents the king with narrow shoulders 
lacking in musculature, and with a marked pot belly, wide hips, 
and generous thighs (fig. 3.35). His large lips, distinctive nose and 
chin, and narrow eyes make his face readily recognizable. The 
Amarna style, which was not reserved for the king s image but 
influenced representations of court officials and others as well, 
specifically emphasized naturalism in the body. Still, these 
unusual portraits of Akhenaten have puzzled scholars. Some dis¬ 
miss them as caricatures, yet such expensive and prominent 
images must have had the king s approval. There have also been 
attempts to diagnose a medical condition from these representa¬ 
tions, by reading the king s features as symptoms of Frolichs 
Syndrome, a hormonal deficiency that produces androgynous 
(both male and female) characteristics. Possibly he simply 
intended his “feminized” appearance to capture the androgynous 
fertile character of Aten as life-giver. 

Group representations of Akhenaten with his family—his 
consort Nefertiti and three oldest daughters—are equally remark¬ 
able for the apparent intimacy among the figures. This is clear on 
a sunk-relief scene on an altar stele, of the kind that Egyptians 
would erect in small shrines in their homes and gardens (fig. 3.36). 
Beneath the disk of the sun, its life-giving beams radiate down¬ 
ward with hands at their terminals. Attenuated reed columns

suggest that the scene takes place within a garden pavilion, which 
is stocked with wine jars. The king and his consort sit facing each 
other on stools. They hold three lively daughters, who clamber on 
their laps and in their arms, uniting the composition with ani¬ 
mated gestures that reach across the relief in marked contrast to 
the static quality of scenes of other times. The deliberate empha¬ 
sis on the daughters 5 childishness marks a change: In the past, 
artists had represented children with a hieroglyphic pictograph of 
an adult in miniature, sucking a finger. The emphasis on children 
epitomizes the regeneration that the royal couple represent, and 
especially the king as manifestation of Aten. 

QU E E N Tl Y The surprising transience implicit in the children s 
youthfulness and animated gestures on the altar also characterizes 
a one-third-life-size portrait of Akhenaten s mother Queen Tiy, 
chief wife of Amenhotep III (fig. 3.37). Using the dark wood of 
the yew tree, with precious metals and semiprecious stones for 
details, the artist achieved a delicate balance between idealized 
features and signs of age. Smooth planes form the cheeks and 
abstract contours mark the eyebrows, which arch over striking 
eyes inlaid with ebony and alabaster. Yet the downturned mouth 
and the modeled lines running from the sides of the nose to the 
mouth offer careful hints of the queen s advancing years. 

The sculpture went through two stages of design: Initially, the 
queen wore gold jewelry and a silver headdress ornamented with 
golden cobras, which identified her with the funerary goddesses 
Isis and Nephthys. A wig embellished with glass beads and 
topped with a plumed crown (the attachment for which is still

extant) later concealed this headdress. Although excavators dis¬ 
covered the sculpture with funerary paraphernalia for her hus¬ 
band, Amenhotep III, these changes indicate that it was adapted 
to suit the beliefs of Akhenaten s new monotheistic religion. 

PORTRAITS OF NEFERTITI As with Akhenaten s images, 
early depictions of Nefertiti emphasize her reproductive capacity 
by contrasting a slender waist with large thighs and buttocks. 
Sculptures from the second half of Akhenaten s reign, however, 
are less extreme. At Amarna, archaeologists discovered the studio 
of the king s chief sculptor, Tuthmosis, whom court records call 
“the king s favorite and master of the works.” This yielded sculp¬ 
tures at every stage of production: heads and limbs of quartzite and 
jasper, and torsos of royal statues to which they could be affixed. 
Plaster casts were found, modeled from clay or wax studies taken 
from life. The most famous of these sculptures is a bust of Nefertiti, 
plastered over a limestone core and painted—a master portrait, 
perhaps, from which artists could copy other images (fig. 3.38). 
The sculpture s left eye lacks the inlay of the right, showing that

Interpreting Ancient Travel Writers 


A great many Creeks went to Egypt; some, as might be expected, 
for business, some to serve in the army, but also some pst to see 
the country itself. 

—Herodotus 

O ne of the primary sources available to art historians is the writing 
of ancient travelers. Despite the dangers of travel in antiquity, 
from shipwrecks to thievery, Egypt became a prime destination for 
curiosity-seekers, beginning around 1 500 bce, and peaking during the 
first and second centuries ce. Locals did what they could to entice trav¬ 
elers. In Roman times, men from Busiris, near Giza, would climb the 
pyramids’ slippery slopes as a tourist attraction. Some early travelers 
painted or scratched their names on works of art, among them 
Hadrian’s wife, Sabina. Others made a crucial—if complex—contribu¬ 
tion to our knowledge of ancient monuments by writing about their 
journeys. Born in the early fifth century bce in Halicarnassos (present- 
day Bodrum, Turkey), Herodotus spent the best part of his adulthood 
traveling throughout the Mediterranean and the Near East. His account 
of his Egyptian travels still survives. In the late first century bce, the 
Greek geographer Strabo also wrote a valuable description of his 
experiences in Egypt and elsewhere. 


These authors saw the “great wonders” at first hand, at a time when 
much more survived of them than is the case today. Often, their 
accounts supply vital information for reconstructions, or other details, 
such as the names of artists, architects, or patrons; but it is a mistake 
to accept the writers’ words uncritically. These ancient travelers had 
different priorities from the modern art historian, and this fact would 
certainly have affected the accuracy of their accounts. Herodotus, for 
instance, was much more interested in religion than in works of art or 
architecture. This results in him giving considerably less detailed or 
precise information about artistic monuments than we might desire. It 
is also all too easy to forget that even ancient travelers visited Egypt 
at least a millennium after the pyramids and other monuments had 
been built. Furthermore, they relied on traditions handed down by 
guides and other locals, who, research shows, were often misinformed. 
Herodotus insists that the blocks of Khufu’s pyramid were all at least 
30 feet long, when 3 feet would have been more accurate. He also 
attributes the work to slaves, thus denigrating Khufu as a tyrant. Local 
priests may have broadcast this view in the fifth century bce to please 
their Persian rulers. Along tradition among scholars of giving greater 
credence to classical texts than other types of evidence has led, in many 
instances, to an undue acceptance of ancient authors’ words as “truth,” 
even when archaeological evidence paints a different picture.

the bust remained unfinished, but an extraordinary elegance still 
derives from the sculptor s command of geometry, which is at once 
precise—the face is completely symmetrical—and subtle. The 
sculptor abandoned this piece and another similar head in the work¬ 
shop when he moved from Amarna to Memphis after Akhenaten s 
death in 1335 bce and the subsequent razing of his city. 


been hastily coopted for the king at the time of his unanticipated 
death. All the same, offerings buried with him lacked nothing in 
volume or quality. Indeed, the immense value of the objects 
makes it easy to understand why grave robbers have been active 
in Egypt ever since the Old Kingdom. The tomb contained 


Tutankhamun and the Aftermath of Amarna 

Shortly after Akhenaten s death, a young king ascended the 
throne. Married to Akhenaten s daughter, even perhaps himself 
one of Akhenaten s sons, Tutankhaten was only nine or ten when 
he became king. Possibly under the influence of the priests of 
Amun, he restored the royal residence to Memphis and resur¬ 
rected the orthodox religion of Egypt that Akhenaten had 
rejected. He changed his name to Tutankhamun to reflect the 
monarchy s renewed alliance with Amun, before dying unexpect¬ 
edly at the age of 19. His sudden death has inspired numerous 
murder and conspiracy theories, but recent scientific studies of his 
mummy point to natural causes. 

Tutankhamun s greatest fame results not from his life, but 
from his death and the discovery of his tomb in 1922 by the 
British archaeologist Howard Carter. Although robbers had 
entered the tomb twice, much of it remained untouched when 
Carter found it (fig. 3.39). With a stairway, corridor, and four 
chambers, the tomb is uncharacteristically small for a royal bur¬ 
ial, leading scholars to suppose that a nonroyal tomb might have

The Book of the Dead 

This text is an incantation from Plate III of the Papyrus of Ani in the 
British Museum , from the latter half of the Eighteenth Dynasty. It 
accompanies the weighing of the soul illustrated in the closely related 
The Book of the Dead of Hunefer (see fig. 3.40). 

S aith Thoth the righteous judge of the cycle of the gods great who 
are in the presence of Osiris: Hear ye decision this. In very truth 
is weighed the heart of Osiris, is his soul standing as a witness for 
him; his sentence is right upon the scales great. Not hath been found 


wickedness [in] him any; not hath he wasted food offering in the tem¬ 
ples; not hath he done harm in deed; not hath he let go with his mouth 
evil things while he was upon earth. 

Saith the cycle of the gods great to Thoth [dwelling] in Hermopolis 
[the god s cult-center along the Nile in Upper Egypt]: Decreed is it 
that which cometh forth from thy mouth. Truth [and] righteous [is] 
Osiris, the scribe Ani triumphant. Not hath he sinned, not hath he 
done evil in respect of us. Let not be allowed to prevail Amemet 
[Ammut, the devourer of souls] over him. Let there be given to him 
cakes, and a coming forth in the presence of Osiris, and a field abid¬ 
ing in Sekhet-hetepu [Lield of Peace] like the followers of Horus. 




funerary equipment, such as coffins, statues, and masks, as well as 
items used during the king s lifetime, such as furniture, clothing, 
and chariots. Many of the objects feature images of Tutankhamun 
battling and overcoming foreign enemies, as part of his kingly 
duty to maintain order amid chaos. Three coffins preserved the 
king s mummified corpse, the innermost of which is gold and 
weighs over 250 pounds. Most impressive is the exquisite work¬ 
manship of its cover, with its rich play of colored inlays against 
polished gold surfaces (fig. 3.40). The number and splendor of the 
objects in the burial of a minor king like Tutankhamun make the 
loss of the burial finery of powerful and long-lived kings all the 
more lamentable. 

Tutankhamun s short-lived successor, the aged Ay, continued 
the process of restoring the old religion. He married 
Tutankhamun s widow, perhaps to preserve, rather than usurp, 
succession to the throne. Head of the army under Tutankhamun 
and last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Horemheb completed 
the restoration process: He set out to erase all traces of the 
Amarna revolution, repairing shattered images of the traditional 
gods and rebuilding their temples; but the effects of Akhenaten s 
rule lived on in Egyptian art for some time to come. 

PAPYRUS SCROLLS: 

THE BOOK OF THE DEAD 

Inscriptions on walls and furnishings accompanied royal burials 
like Tutankhamun s. Yet in the Middle Kingdom, the desire to 
include the prayers and incantations that accompanied kings to 
the afterlife spread to other classes of patrons. By the New 
Kingdom, these patrons commissioned scribes to make illustrated 
funerary texts such as The Book of the Dead which first appeared 
in the Eighteenth Dynasty. This is a collection of over 200 incan¬ 
tations or spells that ultimately derived from the Coffin Texts of 
the Middle Kingdom, which scribes copied onto scrolls made of 
papyrus reeds. The popularity of The Book of the Dead in the

New Kingdom signals a change in Egyptian beliefs about the 
afterlife: Any member of the elite could enjoy an afterlife, as long 
as the deceased had lived in accordance with ma’at and could pass 
tests imposed by the gods of the underworld. In order to ensure 
that the deceased had the knowledge required to do this and 
progress to the hereafter, relatives generally placed a version of 
The Book of the Dead inside the coffin or wrapped within the 
mummy bandaging itself. Among the scenes illustrating the book 
are the funeral procession, the weighing of the heart, and the pro¬ 
vision of nourishment for the dead. 

One of the finest surviving examples is The Book of the Dead 
of Hunefer, dating from about 1285 bce. The scene representing 
the weighing of the heart and Osiris’ judgment of the dead in 
Chapter 125 (see Primary Source , above) conforms to a well- 
defined type that many workshops shared (fig. 3.41). Derived 
from traditional tomb painting, its imagery has been adapted to 
the format of the scroll to be a continuous narrative, repeating 
protagonists in one scene after another without a dividing frame¬ 
work. At the left, Anubis, the jackal-faced guardian of the under¬ 
world, leads Hunefer into the Hall of the Two Truths. Anubis 
then weighs Hunefer s heart, contained in a miniature vase, 
against the ostrich feather of Ma’at, who symbolized divine order 
and governed ethical behavior. Ma’at s head appears on the top of 
the scales. Thoth, the ibis-headed scribe, records the outcome. 
Looking on with keen interest is Ammut. Made up of the parts of 
various ferocious beasts—the head of a crocodile, the body and 
forelegs of a lion, and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus—she 
was the devourer of those whose unjust life left them unworthy 
of an afterlife. 

The deceased had to swear to each of the deities seen overhead 
that he or she had lived according to ma 3 at. When he had been 
declared “true of voice,” Horus presented him to his father, Osiris, 
shown with emblems of kingship, wrapped in a white mummy¬ 
like shroud, and seated in a pavilion floating above a lake of natron, 
a salt used for preserving the body. With him are Isis and her 
sister Nephthys, mother of Anubis and protector of the dead. In 
front of the throne, the four sons of Horus stand on a white lotus 
blossom, symbol of rebirth. Also considered the gods of the car¬ 
dinal points, they protected the internal organs that were removed 
as part of the embalming process and placed in containers known

as canopic jars. Above, Horus, identified by the eye he lost in his 
struggle with Seth, called the udjat eye, bears an ostrich feather, 
representing the favorable judgment of Ma’at. In the afterlife, as 
on earth, the desire for order was paramount. 

LATE EGYPT 

Tutankhamuns revival of the cult of Amun and the ancient 
sources of The Book of the Dead demonstrate that New Kingdom 
Egyptians deeply venerated the traditions of the past. Even as 
Ramesses II extended the borders of his realm to the south and 
the east, the cult centers at Luxor and Karnak absorbed great 
wealth and developed great influence. About 1076 bce, barely 70 
years after the end of the reign of Ramesses III, priests began to 
exert more and more power, until during the Twenty-first 
Dynasty the cult of Amun dominated Egypt. Thereafter, succes¬ 
sive groups of foreigners controlled the area, including Nubians, 
Persians, and Macedonians, and the era known as the New 
Kingdom comes to an end. 

The final phase of ancient Egypt belongs to the history of 
Greece and Rome. Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and 
founded the city of Alexandria before his death in 323 bce. His 
general, Ptolemy (d. 284 bce), became king of the region, and 
established a dynasty that lasted nearly 300 years, until the death 
of Ptolemy XIV or Caesarion, Cleopatra’s son by the Roman dic¬ 
tator Julius Caesar. In 30 bce, the Roman general Octavian, soon 
to be the emperor Augustus, claimed Egypt as a Roman province. 
Despite its lack of autonomy, Egypt flourished economically 


under the Greeks and Romans. In the Ptolemaic period, 
Alexandria became one of the most vibrant centers of culture and 
learning in the Hellenistic world, and its port ensured a lively 
trade that reached as far as China and India. In Roman times, the 
Nile s life-giving waters made Egypt the chief source of grain in 
the empire, earning it the title of Romes granary. But in addition 
to this commercial function, Egypt provided Rome and its succes¬ 
sors with inspiring models of kingly power and imagery that 
lasted through the ages. 

For some 3,000 years, from the era of the pyramids down to 
the time of the Ptolemies, Egyptian kings built magnificent struc¬ 
tures that expressed their wealth and their control over the land 
and its resources. All aspects of royal patronage demonstrated the 
intimate link between the king and the gods. Building in stone and 
on a grand scale, Egyptian kings sought to impress a viewer with 
the necessity and inevitability of their rule. The formulas for rep¬ 
resenting the power of the king are as old as Egypt itself. 

Egyptian kings and other elite patrons built structures for 
both the living and the dead. The objects and images placed in 
their tombs for the afterlife offer a modern viewer a glimpse of the 
material goods that they enjoyed in their lifetimes. The tombs 
provided a safe haven for the body and the soul ( ka ) of the 
deceased. They were built to endure, and they were equipped 
with numerous representations of the dead. These representations 
were also designed to last by virtue of being made of the most per¬ 
manent of materials. Permanence was also sought through the 
consistent use of conventions for representing the patron. The 
longevity of Egyptian art forms testifies to the longevity of 
Egyptian social structures, political organization, and beliefs.

Aegean Art 



T he mediterranean was one of the primary highways that 

connected the cultures of antiquity. With North Africa on the south, 
Asia on the east, and Europe on the west and north, this body of water 
brought disparate cultures into contact for both trade and conflict. The 
Greeks named one branch of the Mediterranean, between Greece and Turkey, the 


Aegean Sea, and on islands and peninsulas there several closely 
related but distinct cultures developed in the third and second 
millennia bce. The Cycladic culture emerged on the islands form¬ 
ing an irregular circle between the Greek mainland and the island 
of Crete. The British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans named the 
culture on the island of Crete Minoan, because the later Greeks 
associated Crete with the legendary King Minos, son of the Greek 
god Zeus, and a mortal princess, Europa. The culture on the 
mainland is called Helladic, from the Greek Hellas. Together, 
these separate cultures formed a civilization we know today as 
Aegean, after the sea that both separates and unites them. 

Until the second half of the nineteenth century, Aegean civi¬ 
lization was known principally from The Iliad and The Odyssey , 
epic tales of gods, kings, and heroes attributed to the eighth- 
century bce Greek poet (or group of poets) known as Homer. His 
story of the siege of Troy and its aftermath still excites the 
modern imagination. Prompted by these stories, and curious to 
determine whether they had a factual basis, German archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann excavated sites in Asia Minor and Greece 
during the 1870s. Following his lead, Arthur Evans began excava¬ 
tions in Crete in 1900. Since then, a great deal of archaeological 
evidence has come to light, some consistent with, but much 
contradicting, Homers tales. Although writing has been found in 

Detail of figure 4.20, Corbeled casemate at Tiryns, Greece 


Minoan and Mycenaean contexts, it is not bountiful and scholars 
are still working on its decipherment. (Note the absence of 
Primary Source boxes in this chapter.) Consequently, we under¬ 
stand less about Aegean civilization than we do about the cultures 
of Egypt or the ancient Near East. 

There is evidence of human habitation throughout the Aegean 
as early as the Paleolithic period, though settlements spread and 
grew mainly in the Neolithic and Early Bronze ages. Scholars 
divide the Aegean Bronze Age into three phases: Early, Middle, 
and Late, each of which is further subdivided into three phases, I, 
II, and III. Archaeologists often prefer these relative dates to 
absolute dates, because the chronology of the Aegean Bronze Age 
is so open to debate. The Early phase (ca. 3000-2000 bce) corre¬ 
sponds roughly to the Predynastic and Old Kingdom period of 
Egypt, and Sumerian and Akkadian culture in Mesopotamia. The 
Middle phase (ca. 2000-1600 bce) is contemporaneous with the 
Middle Kingdom in Egypt and the rise of Babylon in 
Mesopotamia. And the Late phase (ca. 1600-1100 bce) is contem¬ 
poraneous with the Second Intermediate Period and the New 
Kingdom in Egypt, the Hittite overthrow of Babylon, and the rise 
of the Assyrians in Mesopotamia. A mass destruction of Aegean 
sites, from a cause still unknown to us, led to significant depopu¬ 
lation in about 1200 bce, and, despite a slight resurgence, by 1100 
bce the Aegean Bronze Age had come to an end. 

The different cultures of the Aegean produced distinct art 
forms. Stylized marble representations of the human figure and

frescoes are paramount in the Cyclades. Large palaces with elab¬ 
orate adornments on their walls dominate on Crete. Citadels and 
grave goods remain from the Greek mainland. In the absence of 
extensive writing, these works of art provide valuable insights 
into Aegean practices and ideals. The fact that the tales of Homer 
and Greek myths look back to these cultures testifies to their 
importance in the development of later Greek culture. 

EARLY CYCLADIC ART 

Information about the culture of the Cyclades comes entirely 
from the archaeological record, which indicates that wealth accu¬ 
mulated there early in the Bronze Age as trade developed, espe¬ 
cially in obsidian, a dark volcanic stone. Funerary practice reflects 
this prosperity. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, around 
2800 bce, the islanders started to bury their dead in stone-lined 
pits sealed with stone slabs, known today as cist graves. Although 
they lacked large-scale markers, some of these graves contained 
offerings, such as weapons, jewelry, and pottery. Potters crafted 
their wares by hand in the Early Cycladic period, and in addition 
to drinking and eating vessels, they produced flat round objects 
with handles, decorated with incised or stamped spirals and cir¬ 
cles, and sometimes with abstract renderings of ships (fig. 4.1). 


Archaeologists nickname them “frying pans” because of their 
shape, but they may in fact have been palettes for mixing cosmet¬ 
ics, or, once polished, served as an early kind of mirror. 

Some Cycladic burials included striking figures, usually 
female, carved from the local white marble. The Early Cycladic II 
example illustrated here represents the prevalent type (fig. 4.2). 
The figure is nude, with arms folded across the waist, and toes 
extended. The flat body has a straight back, and a long, thick 
neck supports a shield-shaped face at a slight angle. The artist 
used abrasives, probably emery from the island of Naxos, to 
distinguish details on the figure, such as a ridgelike nose, small 
pointed breasts, a triangular pubic area, and eight toes. Traces of 
pigments on a few figures indicate that the artist painted on other 
details, including eyes, hair, jewelry, and body markings similar 
to tattoos. 

Female figures of this type are always standing (or reclining). 
They come in many sizes (the largest reaching 5 feet long and the 
smallest only a few inches), but their form is consistent enough to 
indicate a governing canon of proportions, as with Egyptian 
sculptures (see Chapter 3). All the same, a number of figures 
clearly stand outside this canon. For instance, some appear to be 
pregnant. There are also some male figures. These are usually 
seated and play a musical instrument, such as a flute or a harp, like 
the player illustrated in figure 4.3.

For many years, archaeologists called these figures Cycladic 
“idols,” and pictured them playing a central role in a religion 
focusing on a mother goddess. More recently scholars have 
offered two other plausible explanations for their functions. 
Perhaps sculptors crafted them purely for funerary purposes, to 
represent servants or surrogates for human sacrifices, or even for 
the body of the deceased. Alternatively, they may have served a 
different function before burial, possibly within household 
shrines. Although most have come to light in a reclining position, 
they may once have been propped upright. Some examples show 
signs of repair with wire, which is a strong indication that people 
used—and valued—them before depositing them in graves. 

Most likely, no single explanation applies to all of them. The 
greatest obstacle to determining their function is our general 
ignorance about their provenance, that is, where and how they 
were found and their subsequent history The simplicity and clear 
geometry of the figures appeals to a twentieth- and twenty-first- 
century aesthetic that favors understated and clean geometric 
forms. Those qualities and the luscious white marble used to form 
the figures have led to their widespread appearance on the art 
market, often without any record of archaeological context. In

CHAPTER 4 AEGEAN ART 83 








order to better interpret these figures, archaeologists need to 
know their exact findspots, whether in a burial context or in 
living quarters. 

The carved figures of women and musicians that survive from 
these Aegean islands seem to look back to Paleolithic and 
Neolithic figures, such as the Woman o fWillendorf (see fig. 1.14). 
Yet the characteristic pattern of these figures—the canon that they 
followed—is distinct to these islands (and to Crete, where some 
examples have surfaced). The tradition of making figural imagery 
in the marble native to these islands would become a dominant 
feature of later Greek art. 

MINOAN ART 

Archaeologists have found a wider range of objects and structures 
on the island of Crete than on the Cyclades. This large island, 
south of the Cyclades, and about 400 miles (640 km) northwest of 
Egypt, stretches over 124 miles (200 km) from east to west, 
divided by mountain ranges, and with few extensive areas of flat, 
arable land (map 4.1). This geography, along with continuous 
migration throughout the Bronze Age, encouraged diversity and 
independence among the population: Minoan communities 
tended to be small and scattered. All the same, as a result of inhab¬ 
iting an island that is centrally placed in the Mediterranean, 
Minoans became skilled seafarers and developed a powerful fleet 
of ships. 

The major flowering of Minoan art occurred about 2000 bce, 
when Crete’s urban civilizations constructed great “palaces” at 
Knossos, Phaistos, and Mallia. At this time, the first Aegean 
script, known as Linear A, appeared. This is known as the First 
Palace period, comprising Middle Minoan I and II. Little evidence 
of this sudden spurt of large-scale building remains, as all three 
early centers suffered heavy damage, probably from an earth¬ 
quake, in about 1700 bce. A short time later, the Minoans built 
new and even larger structures on the same sites. This phase con¬ 
stitutes the Second Palace period, which includes Middle Minoan 
III and Late Minoan IA and IB. An earthquake demolished these 
centers, too, in about 1450 bce. After that, the Minoans aban¬ 
doned the palaces at Phaistos and Mallia, but the Mycenaeans, 
who gained control of the island almost immediately, occupied 
Knossos. 

The “Palace ” at Knossos 

The buildings of the Second Palace period are our chief source of 
information for Minoan architecture. The largest is the structure 
at Knossos, which its excavator, Arthur Evans, dubbed the Palace 
of Minos (figs. 4.4 and 4.5). In fact, the city of Knossos may have 
been the most powerful Cretan center of the Middle and Late 
Bronze Age, with its most impressive structures dating from 
between 1700 and 1400 bce. These included courts, halls, shrines, 
workshops, storerooms (housing vast clay jars for oil and other 
provisions), and perhaps residential quarters, linked by corridors, 


staircases, and porticoes. Frequent light wells (open spaces reach¬ 
ing down through several floors) illuminated and ventilated inte¬ 
rior spaces (as seen in fig. 4.6). Other amenities in the buildings 
included a system of clay pipes for drainage. Conspicuously lack¬ 
ing are exterior fortifications to protect the complex. Given their 
strength at sea, the Minoans may have had little fear of invasion. 

As well-preserved as it appears, the present complex is a little 
deceptive: Evans reconceived and reconstructed much of it in 
concrete when he worked there between 1900 and 1932 (see The 
Art Historian's Lens , page 87). The original builders at Knossos 
framed the walls with timbers and constructed them out of rub¬ 
ble masonry or mud brick. Some they built of ashlar masonry 
(cut and dressed stone), which gave them a more ornamental 
appearance. Columns, often made of wood with a stone base, 
supported the porticoes. Their form was unusual: A smooth shaft 
tapered downward from a generous cushionlike capital. Often the 
shaft was oval in cross section rather than round. Wall paintings 
suggest that capitals were painted black and the shaft red or white. 
The origin of this type of column remains a mystery. 

At first glance, the plan of the complex (see fig. 4.4) may 
appear confusing and haphazard. This probably explains why 
later Greek legend referred to it as the labyrinth, home of the 
Minotaur, a half-human, half-bull creature who devoured the 
youths the Athenians offered him in tribute, and whom the hero 
Theseus killed after penetrating the maze. Coupled with the nat¬ 
ural defenses of the island s geography, this mazelike arrangement 
of rooms, and a general lack of emphasis on entrances, may have 
been part of a moderate internal defensive strategy. The small size 
of the rooms and the careful control of the suns penetration into 
living spaces through light wells may also have been deliberate 
decisions to keep the buildings cool in hot weather. 

Moreover, the design does have an underlying logic. At its 
core is a large central court, onto which important rooms opened. 
The court divides the plan on an approximately north-south axis. 
On the west, a corridor running north-south separates long, 
narrow storerooms from rooms of less uniform shapes close to 
the court; the latter rooms may have performed a ceremonial role. 
An east-west corridor divides the east wing into (perhaps) a 
workshop area on the north side, and grander halls on the south. 
The complex appears to grow outward from the court, and using 
flat (rather than pitched) roofs would have greatly facilitated the 
building of additional structures. Compared to Assyrian and 
Persian palaces, such as the citadel of Sargon II at Dur Sharrukin 
(fig. 2.17) or the palace of Darius and Xerxes at Persepolis (fig. 
2.26), the overall effect at Knossos is modest; individual units are 
relatively small and the ceilings low. Still, the rich decoration of 
some of the interior walls made for a set of elegant spaces. We 
should also remember that much of what remains belongs to sub¬ 
terranean or ground-floor levels, and archaeologists have long 
believed that grander rooms existed on a lost upper level. 

Exactly how the grand structures of Crete functioned, and 
who lived in them, is still a subject of debate. As noted above, 
Arthur Evans described the complex at Knossos as a “palace” 
when he first excavated it (assigning royal names to various

rooms), and the term stuck, regardless of its accuracy. Evans con¬ 
ceived of the complex as a palace or an elite residence for several 
reasons. He was reacting partly to recent discoveries on the 
Mycenaean mainland, described below, and partly to the presence 
of a grand room with a throne. But the social and political reali¬ 
ties of Evans s own homeland may have been even more influen¬ 
tial in his thinking: He would have been familiar with the large 
palaces that the extended royal family occupied in late Victorian 
England. In fact, excavation of the complex at Knossos suggests 
that a variety of activities went on there. Extensive storage areas 
support a hypothesis that the palace was a center of manufactur¬ 
ing, administration, and commerce. Additionally, some spaces 
that seem ceremonial, such as the great court with its triangular 
raised causeway, and small shrine-like rooms with apparently reli¬ 
gious paraphernalia, suggest that political and sacred activities 
occurred there too. There is no reason to believe that the Minoans 
segregated these activities as neatly as we often do today. 
Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that the functions of the 
various complexes, at Knossos and elsewhere, were identical, or 
that they remained constant over time. 


Wall Paintings: 

Representing Rituals and Nature 

Grand rooms within the complexes at Knossos and elsewhere 
were decorated with paintings. Archaeologists found most of 
them in extremely fragmentary condition, so that what we see 
today is the result of extensive restoration, which may not always 
be entirely reliable. Vibrant mineral colors characterize the 
frescoes, applied to wet or dry plaster in broad washes without 
shading, in a technique known as buon fresco; wide bands of geo¬ 
metric patterns serve as elaborate frames. The prevalent subjects 
of paintings at Knossos go a long way toward supporting a 
hypothesis of ritual activity there. For instance, a miniature 
Second Palace period painting, dating to around 1500 bce, depicts 
a crowd of spectators attending an event—a ritual or a game 
perhaps (fig. 4.7). Art historians know it as the Grandstand Fresco. 
A tripartite building features at the center, which scholars identify 
as a shrine because of the stylized bulls’ horns on its roof and in 
front of its facade. On either side sit two groups of animated 
women, bare-breasted and dressed in flounced skirts. Above and

Two Excavators , Legend , J Archaeology 


I n the mid-nineteenth century, most scholars believed that Homer’s 
epic tales of the Trojan War and its aftermath, The Iliad and The 
Odyssey, were merely the stuff of legend. But just a few decades later, 
that view had radically changed. Two extraordinary men were key 
figures in bringing about that change. One of them was Heinrich 
Schliemann (1822-1 890). The German-born son of a minister, 
Schliemann became wealthy through a succession of business ven¬ 
tures and retired at the age of 41. From a young age, he had been 
fascinated by Homer’s world of gods and heroes, vowing to learn 
ancient Greek (one of about 1 5 languages he would eventually mas¬ 
ter). He became convinced that a historical framework supported 
Homer’s poetry, and during his extensive travels, he learned that a 
handful of archaeologists believed the Turkish site of Hissarlik to be 
the site of Homer’s Troy. After gaining permission from the Turkish 
government to excavate there, he began working officially in 1 871. 
Among the spectacular finds he described in print was “Priam’s 
Treasure,” a hoard of vessels, jewelry, and weapons made of precious 
metals, which he named after Homer’s king of Troy. Then, turning his 
attention to Mycenae, Schliemann discovered the shaft graves of Circle 
A, some of which contained magnificent objects, such as the gold mask 
in figure 4.27. 

Schliemann was also intrigued by the site of Knossos on Crete, but 
he was unable to purchase the land. The opportunity fell instead to 
Arthur Evans (1 851 -1 941), the son of a renowned British naturalist, 
and himself Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. By 1 900, he 
had begun excavating the so-called Palace of Minos at Knossos with 
extraordinary results. In 1 911, in recognition of his contribution to the 
field of archaeology, Evans received a knighthood. 


Until recently, scholars judged these two early archaeologists very 
differently. They deemed Schliemann’s excavation technique destruc¬ 
tive and considered Schliemann himself little more than a treasure 
hunter. Some scholars questioned whether he actually discovered 
“Priam’s Treasure” as a hoard, or whether he assembled sporadic finds 
to make more of a news splash. Tales of his excavations have been 
embellished into myth in their own right. By some accounts, 
Schliemann had his Greek wife, Sofia, model ancient jewelry. Of late, 
scholars have recognized the unfairness of assessing Schliemann by 
modern scientific standards, and they have acknowledged his critical 
role in igniting scholarly and popular interest in the pre-Hellenic world. 

Evans’s reputation has fared better than Schliemann’s, largely 
because of his close attention to stratigraphy, that is, using layers of 
deposit in excavations to gauge relative time. Geologists had devel¬ 
oped this technique in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and 
archaeologists still use it today in a refined form. Evans employed it to 
assess the relative positions of walls and other features, and it led him 
to establish a relative chronology for the entire site. His designations 
of Early, Middle, and Late Minoan periods defined an essential histori¬ 
cal framework for the Aegean world as a whole in the Bronze Age. 
Evans’s work at Knossos included a considerable amount of recon¬ 
struction. His interventions help to make the site comprehensible to 
laypeople, but can also mislead an unknowing viewer. In fact, it was 
Evans, not the Minoans, who built much of what a visitor now sees at 
Knossos. One significant consequence of Evans’s restorations at 
Knossos is that they have kindled debate among conservators about 
how much to restore and how to differentiate visually between ancient 
ruin and modern reconstruction.

below, the painter used countless disembodied heads as a short¬ 
hand technique to denote the crowd, rendered with simple, 
impressionistic black strokes, on a swath of brown for males and 
white for females. The crowd figures are smaller in scale than the 
central women, suggesting that they are of lesser importance. The 
fresco may represent an event that took place in the palace s cen¬ 
tral court, as archaeologists have unearthed remains of a tripartite 
room on the west side of the court. 

In many other Minoan paintings, nature is the primary subject. 
A painting found in fragments in a light well has been restored to 
a wall in the room Evans called the “Queens Megaron” in 
Knossos’ east wing (fig. 4.8), though some have contended that it 
actually belongs on the floor. Blue and yellow dolphins swim 
against a blue-streaked cream background, cavorting with small 
fish. Within the upper and lower frames, multilobed green forms 
represent plants and rocks. Sinuous outlines suggest the creatures’ 
forms, while the curving, organic elements throughout the com¬ 
position animate the painting. Such lively representations of 
nature occur frequently in Minoan art in a variety of mediums, 
and the many images of sea creatures probably reflect the 
Minoans’ keen awareness of and respect for the sea. The casual 
quality of Minoan images contrasts forcefully with the rigidity and 
timelessness of many Egyptian representations, even though there 
is good evidence for contact between Minoan artists and Egypt. 

PAINTED LANDSCAPES IN A SEASIDE TOWN In the 

mid-second millennium bce, a volcano erupted on the Cycladic 
island of Thera (present-day Santorini), about 60 miles (96 km) 
north of Crete. The eruption covered the town of Akrotiri in a 
deep layer of volcanic ash and pumice. Beginning in 1967, excava¬ 
tions directed by Spyridon Marinatos and then Christos Doumas 
uncovered houses dating from the Middle Minoan III phase 
(approximately 1670-1620 bce) preserved up to a height of two 
stories. On their walls was an extraordinary series of paintings. 


Landscapes dominate. In a small ground-floor room, a rocky 
landscape known as the Spring Fresco occupies almost the entire 
wall surface (fig. 4.9). The craggy terrain undulates dramatically, 
its dark outline filled with rich washes of red, blue, and ocher— 
colors that were probably present in the island’s volcanic soils— 
with swirling black lines to add texture within. Sprouting from its 
surface, lilies flower in vivid red trios, while swallows dart 
between them, painted in a few graceful black lines. 

In other rooms at Akrotiri, painters inserted humans into the 
landscape. Often they are life-size, but sometimes smaller, as in a 
painting on the upper section of at least three walls in a large sec¬ 
ond-floor room (fig. 4.10). The scene reflects the town’s role as a 
harbor: A fleet of ships ferries passengers between islands, set 
within a sea full of leaping dolphins. The ships vary, some being 
under sail and some rowed by oarsmen, but the painter’s brush 
describes them all carefully. The same is true of the islands, each 
of which features a port city with detailed stone architecture. 
Crowds of people watch the spectacle from streets, rooftops, and 
windows. The painting may represent an actual event—a memo¬ 
rable expedition to a foreign land, perhaps, or an annual festival. 

Minoan Pottery 

Like the wall paintings, Minoan painted pottery was inspired by 
the natural world of the Aegean. Minoan potters painted their 
vessels sensitively with lively organic forms that enhance the 
curving shapes of the vases. By the Middle and Late Minoan 
periods, they manufactured pottery on the wheel, allowing for a 
variety of rounded forms and many sizes. Minoans used large and 
rough vessels for storage, while inhabitants of the “palaces” used 
the finest wares, which were often very thin-walled. Minoans also 
exported these “eggshell” ceramics in great quantities to markets 
all around the Mediterranean, creating one of the first major inter¬ 
national industries.

KAMARES WARE The shape of a vase from Phaistos in south¬ 
ern Crete, dating to the Middle Minoan II period (about 1800 
bce), illustrates the organic approach of many Minoan potters to 
their wares (fig. 4.11). Its neck curves upward into a beak shape, 
which the vase painter has emphasized by giving it an eye. Bold 
curvilinear forms in white, red, orange, and yellow stand out 
against a black background to form abstracted sea horses, which 
endow the vessel with life and movement. This style, known 
today as Kamares ware, first appears at the beginning of the 
Middle Minoan phase and took its name from the cave on Mount 
Ida where it originally came to light. 

MARINE MOTIFS Marine motifs gained prevalence in the pot¬ 
tery of the slightly more recent Late Minoan IB phase. A stirrup 
jar, with two round handles flanking its narrow spout, makes a 
vivid example of this “marine style.” A wide-eyed black octopus 
swirls its tentacles around the body, contrasting with the light 
eggshell-colored clay (fig. 4.12). Clumps of algae float between 
the tentacles. As with Minoan wall paintings, an extraordinarily 
dynamic and naturalistic quality energizes the painting. 
Moreover, the painting s forms express the shape of the vessel 
they decorate: The sea creature s rounded contours emphasize the 
jar s swollen belly, while the curves of its tentacles echo the curved

handles. Exactly beneath the spout, the end of a tentacle curls to 
define a circle of the same size as the jar s opening. 

Carved Minoan Stone Vessels 

From an early date, Minoan artists also crafted vessels of soft 
stone, either from black steatite (soapstone), which was locally 
available, or from stones imported from other Aegean islands. 
They carved it with tools of a harder stone, hollowing out the 
interior with a bow-driven drill before finishing surfaces with an 
abrasive, probably emery. Traces of gold on some pieces reveal 
that the stone was often gilded. Fragments of such works were 
discovered at Hagia Triada on the southern side of Crete, includ¬ 
ing a black steatite vessel known as the Harvester Vase , with a 
large hole at the top and a smaller hole at the base (fig. 4.13). This 
type of vessel was used for pouring liquid offerings or drinking. 
Later Greeks called it a rhyton (plural rhyta), and archaeologists 
suppose that, like many stone vessels, it had a ceremonial use. 

Only the upper part of the rhyton survives. Twenty-seven 
slim, muscular men, mostly nude to the waist and clad in flat caps 
and pants, seem to move around the vessel in a lively rhythm and 
with raucous energy. Their dynamic movement is a counterpart to 
the animated imagery on Minoan pots and wall paintings. Hoist¬ 
ing long-handled tools over their shoulders, four bare-headed 
singers bellow with all their might. Their leader s chest is so dis¬ 
tended that his ribs press through his skin. A single long-haired

male in a scaly cloak, holding a staff, seems to head the procession. 
The leader of the singers holds a sistrum, a rattle that originated 
in Egypt. This detail and the composite depiction of the men’s 
bodies provide evidence of contact between Crete and Egypt. 

Interpretations of the scene depend partly on identifying the 
tools carried by the crowd and the objects suspended from their 
belts. If they are hoes and bags of seed corn, then the subject may 
be a sowing festival; if, instead, they are winnowing forks and 
whetstones, it is more likely a harvest festival. Alternatively, some 
see the scene as a warriors’ triumph, while still others see a repre¬ 
sentation of forced labor. In the absence of further evidence, 
either archaeological or written, debate about the meaning of the 
image will certainly continue. 

Another magnificent rhyton in the shape of a bull’s head 
comes from Knossos, and dates to the Second Palace period 
(about 1500-1450 bce) (fig. 4.14). Like the Harvester Vase , it is 
carved from steatite, with white shell inlaid around the muzzle. 
For the eyes, the artist inserted a piece of rock crystal, painted on 
the underside with a red pupil, black iris, and white cornea, so 
that it has a startlingly lifelike appearance. The horns, now 
restored, were once of gilded wood. Light incisions in the steatite, 
dusted with white powder, evoke a shaggy texture and variegated 
color in the animal’s fur. The vessel was filled through a hole in 
the neck, and a second hole below the mouth served as a spout. 


Excavators have discovered similar vessels elsewhere in Crete, for 
instance at the palace at Zakros, on the east coast of Crete, and 
contemporaneous Egyptian tomb paintings depict Cretans carry¬ 
ing bull-headed rhyta, suggesting that the civilizations with which 
Minoans traded identified them with these distinctive vessels. The 
prevalence of the bull motif, coupled with evidence of altars 
decorated with horns, suggest that bulls played a part in Minoan 
religious ritual. Rhyta are often found smashed to pieces. 
Although later vandalism or earthquakes might account for the 
damage, their smashed state suggests that ceremonial vessels were 
ritually destroyed after use. 

Religious life on Minoan Crete centered on shrines and on 
natural places deemed sacred, such as caves, mountain peaks, or 
groves. No temples or large cult statues have been discovered. 
Archaeologists did find two small-scale faience statuettes from

the Middle Minoan III phase (about 1650 bce) at Knossos. One 
shows a female figure raising a snake in each hand and wearing a 
headdress topped by a feline creature (fig. 4.15). She is clad in a 
flounced skirt similar to those worn by women in the Grandstand 
Fresco (see fig. 4.7), and bares her breasts. Her tiny waist is 
another consistent feature of Minoan representations of humans, 
like the men on the Harvester Vase (see fig. 4.13). These statuettes 
came to light along with remnants of furniture in pits sunk in the 
floor of a room on the west side of the central court. Because 
some ancient religions associated snakes with earth deities and 
male fertility, and because of this statuette s bared breasts, some 
scholars have associated them with a mother goddess or ritual 
attendants, and identified the room as a shrine. 

Late Minoan Art 

It is unclear what brought Minoan civilization to an end. In the 
past, scholars argued that the eruption of the volcano on the 
island of Thera may have hastened its decline. Recent discoveries 
and dating of the volcanic ash from the eruption, however, indi¬ 
cate that the civilization on Crete survived this natural disaster, 
though perhaps in a weakened state. About 1450 bce (Late 
Minoan II), invaders from the Greek mainland, whom archaeolo¬ 
gists call Mycenaeans, took over the complexes on Crete. They 
established themselves in the center at Knossos until around 1375 
bce, when Knossos was destroyed and the Mycenaeans aban¬ 
doned most of the island s sites. During the period of Mycenaean 
control, however, artists at Knossos worked in Minoan styles. 

The fragmentary Toreador Fresco dates from the Mycenaean 
occupation of Knossos (Late Minoan II—III A), and appears to

MYCENAEAN ART 


By the time the Mycenaeans conquered Crete in about 1450 bce, 
they had been building cities of their own on the Greek mainland 
since the start of the Late Helladic period, ca. 1600 bce. They 


have been one of a series that decorated an upper room in the 
northeast part of the palace (fig. 4.16). Against a deep-blue back¬ 
ground, a white-skinned figure clad in a kilt clasps the horns of a 
huge curvaceous bull, painted at a full gallop. Behind the bull, a 
similar white-skinned figure stands on tiptoe with arms out¬ 
stretched, while above the bulls back, a dark-skinned figure 
performs a backward somersault. The figures have long limbs and 
small waists, and they are painted in profile. The strong washes of 
color, and animated though somewhat stylized poses, demon¬ 
strate the continuity of Minoan practice into the Late period. 

Scholars continue to debate the meaning of this scene. 
Although most agree that such bull-leaping performances had a 
ritual function, the purpose of the activity and the identity of 
the participants remain unclear. Following the widespread 
Mediterranean convention for distinguishing gender by skin tone, 
Arthur Evans identified the light-skinned figures as female and 
the darker one as male. In this case, the presence of women in 
such a prominent role in Minoan imagery may serve as evidence 
of their importance in ritual activities. Others have seen the three 
figures as sequential representations of the same person, taking 
part in a coming-of-age initiation ceremony in which boys cast off 
their earlier “feminine” guise and emerge as fully masculine. 


probably made early contact with Minoan Crete, which exerted 
important influences on their own culture. From the dating of 
Mycenaean sites and the objects discovered in them, archaeolo¬ 
gists place the height of the culture between about 1500 and 1200 
bce (Late Helladic III). The most imposing remains are the 
citadels at sites that Homer named: Mycenae, Pylos, and Tiryns. 
The culture takes its name from the first of these, the legendary 
home of King Agamemnon, who led the Greek forces in Homers 
account of the Trojan War. 

Architecture: Citadels 

At the beginning of the Second Palace period on Crete, growing 
settlements throughout the Greek mainland, including at 
Mycenae itself (figs. 4.17 and 4.18), centered around large struc¬ 
tures known as citadels (when fortified) or palaces. In some of 
them, most particularly Pylos on the southern coast of the

Peloponnesian region (see map 4.1), archaeologists found clay 
tablets inscribed with a second early writing system, which they 
dubbed Linear B because of its linear character and because it 
derived, in part, from earlier Minoan Linear A. Architect and 
classical scholar Michael Ventris decoded the system in 1952. The 
tablets proved to have been inventories and archival documents, 
and the language of Linear B was an early form of Greek. The 
inhabitants of these Late Bronze Age sites, therefore, were the 
precursors of the Greeks of more recent times. 

The Linear B tablets refer to a wanax (“lord” or “king”), sug¬ 
gesting something of a Mycenaean social order, so it is reasonable 
to suppose that Mycenaean citadels and palaces may have incor¬ 
porated royal residences. The inhabitants of many of these sites 
gradually enclosed them with imposing exterior walls. They 
exploited the sites’ topography for defense purposes, and often 
expanded and improved their walls in several building phases. 
They constructed these fortifications of large stone blocks laid on 
top of each other, creating walls that were at times 20 feet thick. 
These walls, and tunnels leading from them to wells that would 


provide water during a siege, have led scholars to regard the 
Mycenaeans as quite different from the Minoans, with a culture 
focused primarily on warfare. The contrast is often stated in terms 
that imply an essential character difference between nature-loving 
Minoans and warmongering Mycenaeans. Homers characteriza¬ 
tions of the kings of this era and, in fact, his entire narrative of the 
Trojan War, only reinforce modern ideas about the Mycenaeans as 
warlike. The poet describes the city of Tiryns, set on a rocky out¬ 
cropping in the plain of Argos in the northeastern Peloponnesus, 
as “Tiryns of the Great Walls.” We should note, however, that 
Mycenaean fortifications date to after the destruction of Minoan 
centers, so the Mycenaeans may have been responding to a new 
set of political and social circumstances. 

The inhabitants at Tiryns fortified their citadel in several 
stages around 1365 bce (fig. 4.19). Like the slightly later walls at 
Mycenae, those at Tiryns consist of massive blocks of limestone, 
weighing as much as 5 tons. For most of the wall, the blocks were 
irregularly shaped (or polygonal), wedged together with smaller 
stones and fragments of pottery. At entrances or other highly 
visible places, the stones might be saw-cut and dressed, or 
smoothed with a hammer. In its final form, the outer wall at 
Tiryns was a full 20 feet thick, and a second inner wall was just as 
impressive. Centuries later, the massiveness of these walls so awed 
the Greeks that they declared them the work of the Cyclopes, a 
mythical race of one-eyed giants. Even today archaeologists term 
such walls “Cyclopean.” 

Builders designed the fortifications at Tiryns carefully to 
manipulate any visitors approach to the residents’ military 
advantage, just as the slightly earlier Hittite fortifications did (see 
fig. 2.22). A narrow fortified ramp circled the walls, so that an 
aggressor approaching in a clockwise direction would have his 
nonshield-bearing side vulnerable to attack by defenders on the 
walls. If an aggressor reached the entrance, two sets of fortified 
propylons (gateways) presented further obstacles: Inhabitants 
could trap the aggressor between the propylons and attack from 
above. Within the walls, rooms and passages known as casemates 
provided storage for weapons (fig. 4.20). They also offered safety 
for townspeople or soldiers during an assault. The gallery passage 
was built using a corbel technique: Each course of masonry 
projects slightly beyond the course below it, until the walls meet 
in an irregular arch to cover the span (fig. 4.21). When a corbel 
roofs an entire space, as it does here, it is called a corbel vault. 

A corbel arch served effectively to create the Lioness Gate at 
Mycenae of about 1250 bce. When the inhabitants enlarged the 
city walls to improve its defenses, they built this gate as a princi¬ 
pal entrance into the citadel (fig. 4.22). Two massive stone posts 
support a huge lintel to form the opening. Above the lintel, a 
corbel arch directs the weight of the heavy wall to the strong posts 
below it. The corbel thus relieves the weight resting on the vast 
stone lintel, which itself weighs 25 tons; this form of construction 
is known as a relieving triangle. To seal the resulting gap, the 
builders inserted a triangular gray limestone slab above the lintel, 
carved with a huge pair of animals, probably lionesses. They stand 
in a heraldic pose (as mirror images of each other), with their

front paws on a pair of altars of a Minoan type, and flanking a 
tapering Minoan-style column, which may have supported 
another element of some kind. Dowel holes in their necks suggest 
that their heads were added separately, in wood or a different 
stone. At almost 10 feet high, this relief is the first large-scale 
sculpture known on the Greek mainland. The lionesses function 
as guardians, and their tense, muscular bodies and symmetrical 
design suggest an influence from the Near East. Mycenaeans 
ventured all over the Mediterranean, including Egypt and 
Anatolia, and Hittite records suggest contact with a people who 
may have been Mycenaean. Similar structures such as the Hittite 
Lion Gate at Bogazkoy in Anatolia (fig. 2.22) may have suggested 
the concept of animal guardians at the gate of a palace. 

The fortifications of Mycenaean citadels protected a variety of 
buildings (see figs. 4.17 and 4.18). These interior structures were 
built of rubble in a timber framework, as in Minoan palaces, 
sometimes faced with limestone. The dominant building was a 
megaron, a large rectangular audience hall. At Tiryns (see fig. 
4.19) the megaron lay adjacent to an open courtyard. Two 
columns defined a deep porch that led into a vestibule and then 
into the hall. The hall contained a throne and a large central hearth 
of stuccoed clay, surrounded by four columns supporting the roof 
beams. Above the hearth, the ceiling may have been left open to 
the sky or covered by a raised roof, allowing smoke to escape and 
light to enter. 

The design of a megaron is essentially an enlarged version of 
simple houses of earlier generations; its ancestry goes back at least 
to Troy in 3000 bce. A particularly well-preserved example 
survives at the southern Peloponnesian palace of Pylos of about 
1300 bce. There, the hearth is set into a plastered floor decorated 
to resemble flagstones of varied ornamental stone (fig. 4.23). A 
rich decorative scheme of wall paintings and ornamental carvings 
enhanced the megaron s appearance. The throne stands against the 
northeast wall, and painted griffins flank it on either side, similar 



4.23 Reconstruction of megaron at Pylos. ca. 1300-1200 bce 


to those decorating the throne room at Knossos, elaborated under 
Mycenaean rule. Other elements of the decoration, such as the 
shape of the columns and the ornament around the doorways, 
reveal further Minoan influence at Pylos. 

Mycenaean Tombs and Their Contents 

At the end of the Middle Helladic period at Mycenae, ca. 1600 
bce, the ruling elite began to bury their dead in deep rectangular 
shafts, marking them at ground level with stones shaped like 
stelai. The burials were distributed in two groups (known as

Grave Circles A and B), which later generations eventually set off 
and monumentalized with a low circular wall. As time passed, the 
elite built more dramatic tombs, in a round form known as a 
tholos. Over 100 tholoi are known on the mainland, nine of them 
near Mycenae. 

One of the best-preserved and largest of these tombs is at 
Mycenae. Dubbed the “Treasury of Atreus” after the head of the 
clan that Homer placed at Mycenae, it dates to about 1250 bce 
(Late Helladic III B). A great pathway, or dromos, lined with 
carefully cut and fitted ashlar masonry, led to a spectacular 
entrance (figs. 4.24 and 4.25). The door slopes inward, in a style 
associated with Egyptian construction. Flanking the opening 
were columns of Egyptian green marble, carved with spirals and 
zigzags. Above the doorway, small columns framed decorative 
marble bands that concealed a relieving triangle. 

The tomb itself consisted of a large circular chamber dug into 
sloping ground and then built up from ground level with a corbel 
vault: Courses of ashlar blocks protruded inward beyond one 
another up to a capstone (fig. 4.26). When built in rings rather 
than parallel walls (as at Tiryns, see fig. 4.20), the corbel vault

results in a beehive profile for the roof. Gilded rosettes may once 
have decorated the ashlar blocks of the vault to resemble a starry 
sky. The vault rose 43 feet over a space 48 feet in diameter. 
Architects would not dare such a large unsupported span again 
until the Pantheon of Roman times (see Chapter 7). To one side of 
the main room, a small rectangular chamber contained subsidiary 
burials. Earth covered the entire structure, helping to stabilize 
the layers of stone and creating a small hill, which was encircled 
with stones. 

METALWORK Like the Great Pyramids of Egypt, these 
monumental tholos tombs exalted the dead by drawing attention 
to themselves. As a result, they also attracted robbers throughout 
the ages, and the grave goods that once filled them have long been 
dispersed. Many of the earlier shaft graves also contained lavish 
burial goods, ranging from luxurious clothing and furniture to 
fine weaponry On excavating Grave Circle A, Heinrich 
Schliemann discovered five extraordinary death masks of ham¬ 
mered gold, covering the faces of dead males. Although far from 
naturalistic, each mask displays a distinct treatment of physi¬ 
ognomy: Some faces are bearded while others are clean-shaven. 
This suggests that the goldsmiths individualized the masks some¬ 
what to correspond to the deceased s appearance. On finding one 
of them in 1876 (fig. 4.27), Schliemann telegraphed a Greek news¬ 
paper, “I have gazed on the face of Agamemnon. ” Since modern 
archaeology places the mask between 1600 and 1500 bce, and the 
Trojan War—if it happened—would date to about 1300-1200 bce, 
this could not in fact be a mask of Agamemnon, despite its title. 
But it may represent a Mycenaean king of some stature, given the 
expense of the materials and the other objects found near it. 
Among the weapons in the graves were finely made ornamental 
bronze dagger blades, some of them inlaid with spirals or figural 
scenes in gold, silver, and niello (a sulfur alloy that bonds with 
silver when heated to produce a shiny black metallic finish). The 
example in figure 4.28 depicts a lion preying on gazelles; the 
dagger s owner claims the lion s predatory strength. 


THE VAPHIO CUPS While the burial method used in the shaft 
graves is distinctively Mycenaean, the treasures found within 
them raise an interesting question about the interactions between 
Minoans and Mycenaeans. Many objects show Minoan influence, 
while others appear so Minoan that they must have come from 
Crete or been created by Cretan craftsmen. Two gold cups from a 
Mycenaean tomb at Vaphio near Sparta, in the southern 
Peloponnesus, are particularly intriguing (fig. 4.29). Probably 
crafted between 1500 and 1450 bce, they are made of two skins of 
gold: The outer layer was embossed with scenes of bull- 
catching—a theme with Minoan roots—while the inner lining is 
smooth. A cylindrical handle was riveted to one side. On one cup, 
bull-trappers try to capture the animal with nets, while on the 
other, a cow is set out to pasture to entice a bull into captivity The 
subject matter of the cups suggests that they refer to one another, 
yet they are not, strictly speaking, a pair. One cup has an upper 
border framing the scene, but the other does not, and stylistic 
analyses suggest that different artists crafted them. Where the 
cups or the artists originated is a matter for debate. For some, the 
“finer” cup (with the pasture scene) must be Minoan on account 
of its peaceful quality, and the other a more violent Mycenaean 
complement made by a Mycenaean—or a Minoan—artist. What 
the cups underline is how little we understand about the interplay 
between, and the movements of, Minoan and Mycenaean artists, 
and, indeed, how arbitrary and subjective our attempts to distin¬ 
guish between them may be. 

Sculpture 

Mycenaean religious architecture apparently consisted of modest 
structures set apart from the palaces. At these small shrines, 
Mycenaeans worshiped a wide variety of gods. Names recorded 
on Linear B tablets indicate that some of them, such as Poseidon, 
are the predecessors of the later Olympian gods of Greece. The 
Greek Poseidon was the god of the sea, and was probably of some 
importance to the seafaring Mycenaeans.

Free-standing sculptures are rare, but one small, finely carved 
ivory group depicting two kneeling women with a young child 
came to light in a shrine next to the palace at Mycenae in 1939 (fig. 
4.30). The women wear flounced skirts similar to the one worn by 
the Minoan Snake Goddess (see fig. 4.15), suggesting that the 
work came from Crete or was carved by an artist from Crete 
working on the Greek mainland for Mycenaean patrons. Yet the 
material is ivory, and probably originated in Syria or Egypt, doc¬ 
umenting Mycenaean trade links. The figures’ intertwined limbs 
and the child’s unsettled pose describe a transient moment. For 
some scholars, the close physical interaction among the figures 
suggests that this small object is a rendering of a family group, 
including grandmother, mother, and child. Others argue that it 
represents three separate divinities, one of whom takes the form 
of a child. 

Along with the “Treasury of Atreus,” with its echoes of 
Egypt, and the Lioness Gate, which is a blend of Minoan and 
Near Eastern influences, this sculpture and others that survive 
from Bronze Age Greece reveal a culture with contacts through¬ 
out the Mediterranean. Whether those contacts came as a result of 
war or trade, the culture of Mycenaean Greece was receptive to 
the ideas and forms of other regions. Despite its warlike and 
dynamic character, Mycenaean civilization collapsed around 1200 
or 1100 bce, probably in the chaos caused by the arrival of new 
peoples on the Greek mainland. Whether or not the inhabitants of 
these powerful citadels actually took part in a legendary ten-year- 
long siege of Troy in Asia Minor, their descendants believed they 
did. For the Greeks, the Mycenaean Age was an age of heroes.

Greek Art 



G reek architecture, sculpture, and painting are 

immediately recognizable as ancestors of Western civilization. A Greek 
temple recalls countless government buildings, banks, and college 
campuses, and a Greek statue evokes countless statues of our own day. 
This is neither coincidental nor inevitable: Western civilization has carefully 


constructed itself in the image of the Greek and Roman worlds. 
Through the centuries, these worlds have represented a height of 
cultural achievement for Western civilization, which looked to 
them for artistic ideals as well as for philosophical models such 
as democracy. 

The great flowering of ancient Greek art was just one manifes¬ 
tation of a wide-ranging exploration of humanistic and religious 
issues. Artists, writers, and philosophers struggled with common 
questions, preserved in a huge body of works. Their inquiries cut 
to the very core of human existence, and form the backbone of 
much of Western philosophy. For the most part, they accepted a 
pantheon of gods, whom they worshiped in human form. (See 
Informing Art , page 105.) Yet they debated the nature of those 
gods, and the relationship between divinities and humankind. Did 
fate control human actions, or was there free will? What was the 
nature of virtue? Greek thinkers conceived of many aspects of life 
in dualistic terms. Order (cosmos in Greek) was opposed to disor¬ 
der (chaos), and both poles permeated existence. Civilization— 
which was, by definition, Greek—stood in opposition to an 
uncivilized world beyond Greek borders; non-Greeks were “bar¬ 
barians,” named for the nonsensical sound of their languages to 
Greek ears (“bar-bar-bar-bar”). Reason, too, had its opposite: the 

Detail of figure 5.6, Griffin-head protome from a bronze tripod-cauldron, 
from Kameiros, Rhodes 


irrational, mirrored in light and darkness, in man and woman. In 
their art as in their literature, the ancient Greeks addressed the 
tension between these polar opposites. 

Trying to understand the visual culture of the worlds on which 
Western civilization so deliberately modeled itself presents a spe¬ 
cial challenge for the art historian: It is tempting to believe that 
something familiar on the surface holds the same significance for 
us today as it did for Greeks or Romans. Yet scholars have discov¬ 
ered time and time again that this is a dangerous fallacy. 

A further complication in studying Greek art is that there are 
three separate, and sometimes conflicting, sources of information 
on the subject. First, there are the works themselves—reliable, but 
only a fraction of what once existed. Secondly, there are Roman 
copies of Greek originals, especially sculptures. These works tell 
us something about important pieces that would otherwise be lost 
to us, but pose their own problems. Without the original, we can¬ 
not determine how faithful a copy is, and sometimes multiple 
copies present several different versions of a single original. This 
is explained by the fact that a Roman copyist s notion of a copy 
was quite different from ours: It was not necessarily a strict imi¬ 
tation, but allowed for interpreting or adapting the work accord¬ 
ing to the copyist s taste or skill or the patron s wishes. Moreover, 
the quality of some Greek sculpture owed much to surface finish, 
which, in a copy, is entirely up to the copyist. If the original was 
bronze and the copy marble, not only would the finish differ 
dramatically, but the copyist might alter the very composition to

accommodate the different strengths of stone and bronze. In rare 
cases, works that appear to be copies because of their general style 
or subject matter are of such high quality that we cannot be sure 
that they really are copies. Lastly, Roman copies tend to come to 
light in Roman contexts, which allows archaeologists to glean 
information about Roman collectors but not about the contexts in 
which Greeks displayed the originals. 

The third source of information about Greek works is litera¬ 
ture. The Greeks were the first Western people to write at length 
about their artists. Roman writers incorporated Greek accounts 
into their own; many of these survive, although often in fragmen¬ 
tary condition. These written sources offer a glimpse of what the 
Greeks considered their significant achievements in architecture, 
sculpture, and painting. They name celebrated artists and monu¬ 
ments, but often deal with lost works and fail to mention 
surviving Greek works that we number among the greatest 
masterpieces of their time. Weaving these strands of information 
into a coherent picture of Greek art has been the difficult task of 
archaeologists and art historians for several centuries. 


THE EMERGENCE OF GREEK ART: 

THE GEOMETRIC STYLE 

The first Greek-speaking groups came to Greece about 2000 bce, 
bringing a culture that soon encompassed most of mainland 
Greece, the Aegean Islands, and Crete. By the first millennium 
bce, they had colonized the west coast of Asia Minor and Cyprus. 
In this period we distinguish three main subgroups: the Dorians, 
centered in the Peloponnese; the Ionians, inhabiting Attica, 
Euboea, the Cyclades, and the central coast of Asia Minor; and 
the Aeolians, who ended up in the northeast Aegean (map 5.1). 
Despite cultural differences, Greeks of different regions had a 
strong sense of kinship, based on language and common beliefs. 
From the mid-eighth through the mid-sixth centuries bce, Greeks 
spread across the Mediterranean and as far as the Black Sea in a 
wave of colonization. At this time, they founded settlements in 
Sicily and southern Italy, collectively known as Magna Graecia, 
and in North Africa. 

After the collapse of Mycenaean civilization described in the 
last chapter, art became largely nonfigural for several centuries. In 
the ninth century bce, the oldest surviving style of Greek art

THE ANCIENT WORLD 


















Greek Gods and Goddesses 


A ll early civilizations and preliterate cultures had creation myths to 
explain the origin of the universe and humanity’s place in it. Over 
time, these myths evolved into complex cycles that represent a com¬ 
prehensive attempt to understand the world. Greek gods and god¬ 
desses, though immortal, behaved in human ways. They quarreled, 
and had offspring with one another’s spouses and often with mortals 
as well. Their own children sometimes threatened and even overthrew 
them. The principal Greek gods and goddesses, with their Roman 
counterparts in parentheses, are given below. 

ZEUS (Jupiter): son of Kronos and Rhea; god of sky and weather, and 
chief Olympian deity. After killing Kronos, Zeus married his sister 
HERA (Juno) and divided the universe by lot with his brothers: POSEI¬ 
DON (Neptune) was allotted the sea, and HADES (Pluto) received 
the underworld, which he ruled with his queen, PERSEPHONE 
(Proserpina). 

Zeus and Hera had several children: 

ARES (Mars), the god of war 
HEBE, the goddess of youth 

HEPHAISTOS (Vulcan), the lame god of metalwork and the forge 

Zeus also had numerous children through his love affairs with other 
goddesses and with mortal women, including: 

ATHENA (Minerva), goddess of crafts, war, intelligence, and wisdom. 
A protector of heroes, she became the patron goddess of Athens, an 


honor she won in a contest with Poseidon. Her gift to the city was an 
olive tree, which she caused to sprout on the Akropolis. 

APHRODITE (Venus), the goddess of love, beauty, and female fertil¬ 
ity. She married Hephaistos, but had many other liaisons. Her children 
were HARMONIA, EROS, and ANTEROS (with Ares); HERMAPHRODITOS 
(with Hermes); PRIAPOS (with Dionysos); and AENEAS (with the Trojan 
prince Anchises). 

APOLLO (Apollo), god of the stringed lyre and bow, who therefore 
both presided over the civilized pursuits of music and poetry, and shot 
down transgressors; a paragon of male beauty, he was also the god of 
prophecy and medicine. 

ARTEMIS (Diana), twin sister of APOLLO, virgin goddess of the hunt 
and the protector of young girls. She was also sometimes considered 
a moon-goddess with SELENE. 

DIONYSOS (Bacchus), the god of altered states, particularly that 
induced by wine. Opposite in temperament to Apollo, Dionysos was 
raised on Mount Nysa, where he invented winemaking; he married the 
princess Ariadne after the hero Theseus abandoned her on Naxos. His 
followers, the goatish satyrs and their female companions, the nymphs 
and humans who were known as maenads (bacchantes), were given to 
orgiastic excess. Yet there was another, more temperate side to 
Dionysos’ character. As the god of fertility, he was also a god of veg¬ 
etation, as well as of peace, hospitality, and the theater. 

HERMES (Mercury), the messenger of the gods, conductor of souls 
to Hades, and the god of travelers and commerce. 



developed, known today as the Geometric Style because of the 
predominance of linear designs. Artists created works of painted 
pottery and small-scale clay and bronze sculpture in this style. 
The forms are closely related: the types of figures found in sculp¬ 
ture often adorned the pottery. 


Geometric Style Pottery 

As quickly as pottery became an art form, Greek potters began to 
develop an extensive, but fairly standardized, repertoire of vessel 
shapes (fig. 5.1), and adapted each type to its function. Making 
and decorating vases were complex processes, usually performed

by different artisans. Each pottery shape presented its own chal¬ 
lenges to the painter, and some became specialists at decorating 
certain types of vases. Large pots often attracted the most ambi¬ 
tious craftsmen because they provided a generous field on which 
to work. At first painters decorated their wares with abstract 
designs, such as triangles, “checkerboards,” and concentric cir¬ 
cles. Toward 800 bce, human and animal figures began to appear 
within the geometric framework, and in elaborate examples these 
figures interact in narrative scenes. This development occurred at 
about the time the alphabet was introduced (under strong Near 
Eastern influence), and contemporaneous, too, with the composi¬ 
tions of the poet (or group of poets) known as Homer, who wrote 


the lasting epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey , tales of the 
Trojan War and the return home of one of its heroes, Odysseus, 
to Ithaka. 

The vase shown here, from a cemetery near the later Dipylon 
gate in northwestern Athens, dates to around 750 bce (fig. 5.2; see 
fig. 5.37). Known as the Dipylon Vase, it was one of a group of 
large vessels Athenians used as funerary markers over burials. 
Holes in its base allowed mourners to pour liquid offerings (liba¬ 
tions) during funerary rituals; the libations filtered down to the 
dead buried below In earlier centuries, Athenians had placed the 
ashes of their dead inside vases, choosing the vase s shape accord¬ 
ing to the sex of the deceased: They placed a womans remains in 
a belly-handled amphora, a type of vase they used more com¬ 
monly for storing wine or oil; a mans ashes were stored in a 
neck-amphora (a wine jar with a long neck). Since the early first 
millennium, Athenians had also used kraters as burial markers, 
large bowl-like vessels in which they normally mixed wine with 
water (see fig. 5.1). The shape of the vase illustrated here shows 
that the person buried beneath was a woman; its monumentality 
indicates that she was a woman of considerable means. 

The amphora is a masterpiece of the potter s craft. At over 5 
feet tall, it was too large to be thrown in one piece. Instead, the 
potter built it up in sections, joined with a clay slip (clay mixed 
with water or another liquid). A careful proportional scheme gov¬ 
erned the vessel s form: Its width measures half of its height and 
the neck measures half the height of the body. The potter placed 
the handles so as to emphasize the widest point of the body. Most 
of the decoration is given over to geometric patterns dominated 
by a meander pattern, also known as a maze or Greek key pattern 
(fig. 5.3), a band of rectangular scrolls, punctuated with bands of 
lustrous black paint at the neck, shoulder, and base. The geomet¬ 
ric design reflects the proportional system of the vase s shape. 
Single meander patterns run in bands toward the top and bottom

of the neck; the triple meander encircling the neck at the center 
emphasizes its length. The double and single meanders on the 
amphoras body appear stocky by contrast, complementing the 
body’s rounder form. On the neck, deer graze, one after the other, 
in an identical pattern circling the vase. At the base of the neck, 
they recline, with their heads turned back over their bodies, like 
an animate version of the meander pattern itself, which moves 
forward while turning back upon itself. These animal friezes pre¬ 
figure the widespread use of the motif in the seventh century bce. 

In the center of the amphora, framed between its handles, is a 
narrative scene. The deceased lies on a bier, beneath a checkered 
shroud. Standing figures flank her with their arms raised above 
their heads in a gesture of lamentation; four additional figures 
kneel or sit beneath the bier. Rather than striving for naturalism, 
the painter used solid black geometric forms to construct human 
bodies. A triangle represents the torso, and the raised arms extend 
the triangle beyond the shoulders. The scene represents the proth¬ 
esis , part of the Athenian funerary ritual, when the dead person 
lay in state and public mourning took place. For the living, a 
lavish funeral was an occasion to display wealth and status, and 
crowds of mourners were so desirable that families would hire 
professionals for the event. Thus the depiction of a funeral on the 
vase is not simply journalistic reportage but a visual record of the 
deceased person’s high standing in society. 

Archaeologists have found Geometric pottery in Italy and the 
Near East as well as in Greece. This wide distribution reflects the 
important role of not only the Greeks but also the Phoenicians, 
North Syrians, and other Near Eastern peoples as agents of diffu¬ 
sion around the Mediterranean. What is more, from the second 
half of the eighth century onward, inscriptions on these vases 
show that the Greeks had already adapted the Phoenician alpha¬ 
bet to their own use. 

Geometric Style Sculpture 

A small, bronze sculptural group representing a man and a cen¬ 
taur dates to about the same time as the funerary amphora, and 
there are similarities in the way the artist depicted living forms in 
both works of art (fig. 5.4). Thin arms and flat, triangular chests 
contrast with rounded buttocks and legs. The heads are spherical 
shapes, with beards and noses added. The metalworker cast the 
sculptural group in one piece, uniting the figures with a common 
base and through their entwined pose. Indeed, the figures obvi¬ 
ously interact, revealing the artist’s interest in narrative, a theme 
that persists throughout the history of Greek art. The figures’ 
helmets suggest that their encounter is martial, and the larger scale 
of the man may indicate that he will prevail in the struggle. It is 
hard to say whether the artist was referring to a story known to 
the audience. Many scholars believe the male figure represents the 
hero Herakles, son of Zeus and a mortal woman, who fought 
centaurs many times in the course of his mythical travails. The 
group probably came to light in the great Panhellenic (all-Greek) 
sanctuary at Olympia, home of the Olympic games. This sanctu¬ 
ary, like the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delphi, home of the

Panhellenic games (see fig. 5.19), was not specific to one city-state: 
People from cities all over the Greek world routinely visited it for 
festivals and to make dedications to the gods, which accounts for 
its gradual monumentalization. There was a distinct rise in dedi¬ 
cations there and at Delphi in the eighth century bce, especially of 
small metal objects. Judging by the figurative quality of the sculp¬ 
tural group, by the costliness of the material, and the complexity 
of the technique, it was probably a sumptuous votive offering. 

THE ORIENTALIZING STYLE: 
HORIZONS EXPAND 

Between about 725 and 650 bce, a new style of art emerged in 
Greece that reflects strong influences from the Near East and 
Egypt. Scholars call this the Orientalizing period, when Greek art 
and culture rapidly absorbed Eastern motifs and ideas, including 
hybrid creatures such as griffins and sphinxes. This movement led 
to a vital period of experimentation, as artists strove to master 
new forms. 


CHAPTER 5 GREEK ART 107 




Miniature Vessels 


The Orientalizing style replaced the Geometric in many Greek 
city-states, including Athens. One of the foremost centers of its 
production, though, was Corinth, at the northeastern gateway to 
the Peloponnese. During this period, Corinth came to dominate 
colonizing ventures to the west, as well as the trade in pottery 
exports. Its workshops had a long history of pottery production, 
and at this time vase painters learned to refine a black gloss slip, 
which they used to create silhouette or outline images. By incis¬ 
ing the slip, they could add fine detail and vivacity to their work. 
They particularly specialized in crafting miniature vessels like the 
vase shown here, which is a Proto-Corinthian aryballos or per¬ 
fume jar, dating to about 680 bce (fig. 5.5). Despite its small size, 
intricate decoration covers the vase s surface. Around the shoul¬ 
der stalks a frieze of animals, reminiscent of Near Eastern motifs 
and of the frieze on the Dipylon Vase (see figs. 2.21 and 5.2). 
Bands of real and imaginary animals are a hallmark of Corinthian 
and other Orientalizing wares: They cover later vases from top to 
bottom. A guilloche pattern ornaments the handle, and meander 
patterns enliven the edge of the mouth and the handle (see fig. 
5.3). The principal figural frieze offers another early example of 
pictorial narrative, but the daily-life scenes that are characteristic 
of Geometric pottery yield here to the fantastic world of myth.

On one side, a stocky nude male wielding a sword runs toward a 
vase on a stand. On the side shown here, a bearded male struggles 
to wrest a scepter or staff from a centaur. According to one the¬ 
ory, the frieze represents a moment in Herakles’ conflict with a 
band of centaurs on Mount Pholoe. In Greek mythology, 
centaurs were notoriously susceptible to alcohol, and the mixing 
bowl for wine represented on the other side may indicate the 
reason for their rowdiness. Others interpret the “Herakles” figure

THE ANCIENT WORLD 












as Zeus, brandishing his thunderbolt or lightning. No matter 
how one reads this scene, it was clearly meant to evoke a myth. 
Greeks buried vessels like this aryballos in tombs as offerings 
for the dead, and dedicated them in sanctuaries throughout the 
Greek world. 

BRONZE TRIPODS Among the costliest dedications in Greek 
sanctuaries during the Geometric and Orientalizing periods were 
bronze tripod cauldrons, large vessels mounted on three legs. 
Some of them reached truly monumental proportions, and the 
dedication was not only an act of piety, but also a way to display 
status through wealth. From the early seventh century bce, 
bronze-workers producing these vessels in the Orientalizing style 
attached protomes around the edge of the bowl—images of sirens 
(winged female creatures) and griffins, which were fantasy crea¬ 
tures known in the Near East. The cast protome shown here, 
from the island of Rhodes, is a magnificently ominous creature, 
standing watch over the dedication (fig. 5.6). The boldly upright 
ears and the vertical knob on top of the head contrast starkly with 
the strong curves of the neck, head, eyes, and mouth, while its 
menacing tongue is silhouetted in countercurve against the beak. 
The straight lines appear to animate the curves, so that the danger¬ 
ous hybrid seems about to spring. 


ARCHAIC ART: 

ART OF THE CITY-STATE 

During the course of the seventh and sixth centuries bce, the 
Greeks refined their notion of a polis, or city-state. Once merely 
a citadel, a place of refuge in times of trouble, the city came to 
represent a community and an identity. They governed these city- 
states in various ways, including monarchy (from monarches , 
“sole ruler”), aristocracy (from aristoi and kratia , “rule of the 
best”), tyranny (from tyrannos , “king”), and oligarchy (from 
oligoi , “the few,” a small ruling elite). The citizens of Athens ruled 
their city-state by democracy (from demos , “the people”). The 
path to democracy was a slow one, starting with the reforms of 
Solon, a statesman of the late sixth century. Even after Perikles’ 
radical democratic reforms of 462 bce, women played no direct 
role in civic life, and slavery was an accepted practice, as it was 
throughout the Greek world. With the changing ideal of the city- 
state came transformations in its physical appearance. Scholars 
know the artistic style of this time as Archaic (from archaios , 
Greek for “old”). Architects began to design monumental build¬ 
ings in canonical styles, while artists started to explore human 
movement and emotion. 


The Rise of Monumental Temple Architecture 

Early Greeks worshiped their gods in open-air sanctuaries. The 
indispensable installation for cult (religious practice) rituals was 
an altar, where priests performed sacrifices standing before the 
worshiping community of the Greek polis. Increasingly, though, 


Greeks built temples to accompany these altars. Usually the 
entrance of the temple faced east, toward the rising sun, and the 
altar stood to the east of the temple. The chief function of a 
temple was not so much to house rituals, most of which occurred 
outside the building, but to provide safe shelter for the cult image 
of the god to whom the temple was dedicated, and to store valu¬ 
able dedications. At some point in the seventh century bce, they 
began to design temples in stone rather than wood. Corinthian 
architects were probably the first to make the change, designing 
in a style known as Doric, named for the region where it origi¬ 
nated. From there, the concept spread across the isthmus of 
Corinth to the mainland and up to Delphi and the island of 
Corfu, then rapidly throughout the Hellenic world. A second 
style, the Ionic, soon developed on the Aegean Islands and the 
coast of Asia Minor. The style known as Corinthian did not 
develop until the late fifth century bce (see page 142). 

Greeks recognized the importance of this architectural revolu¬ 
tion even as it happened: Architects wrote treatises on their build¬ 
ings—the first we know of—and the fame they achieved through 
their work has lasted to this day. Writing in the first century bce, 
the Roman architect Vitruvius described the Greek styles of 
architecture, and his work has been central to our understanding 
of Greek building. However, our readings of his text have been 
mediated through early modern commentators and illustrators, 
who wrote of Doric and Ionic “orders” rather than “types,” 
which is a better translation of Vitruvius’ “genera.” The distinc¬ 
tion is important: “Order” suggests an immutable quality, a rigid 
building code, when in fact there is a subtle but rich variation in 
surviving Greek architecture. 

The essential, functioning elements of Doric and Ionic temples 
are very similar, though they vary according to the building’s size 
or regional preferences (fig. 5.7). The nucleus of the building—its 
very reason for existing—is its main chamber, its cella or naos. 
This chamber housed the god’s image. Often, interior columns 
lined the cella walls and helped to support the roof, as well as 
visually framing the cult statue. Approaching the cella is a porch 
or pronaos, and in some cases architects added a second porch 
behind the cella, making the design symmetrical and providing

space for apparatus used in rituals and religious dedications. In 
large temples, a colonnade or peristyle surrounds the cella and 
porches; Vitruvius called this type a peripteral temple. The peri¬ 
style commonly consists of 6 to 8 columns at front and back, and 
usually 12 to 17 along the sides, counting the corner columns 
twice; the largest temples of Ionian Greece had a double colon¬ 
nade. The peristyle added more than grandeur: It offered wor¬ 
shipers shelter from the elements. Being neither entirely exterior 
nor entirely interior space, it also functioned as a transitional 
zone, between the profane world outside and the sanctity of the 
cella. Some temples stood in sacred groves, and the strong vertical 
form of the columns integrated the building with the environment 
of trees. Echoed again by columns inside the cella, the peristyle 
also unified the exterior and interior of the building. 

Differences between the Doric and Ionic styles are apparent in 
a head-on view, or elevation. Many terms that Greeks used to 
describe the parts of their buildings, shown in figure 5.8, are still 
in common usage. The building proper rests on an elevated level 
(the stylobate), normally approached by three steps, known as 
the stereobate. A Doric column consists of a shaft, usually 


marked by shallow vertical grooves, known as flutes, and a 
capital, made up of a flaring, cushionlike echinus and a square 
tablet called the abacus. The entablature includes all the horizon¬ 
tal elements that rest on the columns: the architrave (a row of 
stone blocks directly supported by the columns); the frieze, 
made up of alternating triple-grooved triglyphs and smooth or 
sculpted metopes; and a projecting horizontal cornice, or geison. 
The architrave in turn supports the triangular pediment and the 
roof elements. 

An Ionic column differs from a Doric column in having an 
ornate base, perhaps designed initially to protect the bottom from 
rain. Its shaft is more slender, less tapered, and the capital has a 
double scroll or volute below the abacus. Masons left a sharp 
angle where the flutes met, instead of flattening it as on Doric 
columns. The Ionic column lacks the muscular quality of its 
mainland cousin. Instead, it evokes a growing plant, like a formal¬ 
ized palm tree, a characteristic it shares with its Egyptian prede¬ 
cessors, though it may not have come directly from Egypt. Above 
the architrave, the frieze is continuous, not broken up visually 
into triglyphs and metopes. 


110 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 




Greek builders created temples, whether Doric or Ionic, out 
of stone blocks fitted together without mortar. This required 
them to shape the blocks precisely to achieve smooth joints. 
Where necessary, metal dowels or clamps fastened the blocks 
together. With rare exceptions, they constructed columns out of 
sections called drums, and stonemasons fluted the entire shaft 
once it was in position. They used wooden beams for the ceiling, 
and terra-cotta tiles over wooden rafters for the roof. Fire was a 
constant threat. 

Why and how either style came to emerge in Greece, and why 
they came together into succinct systems so quickly, are questions 
that still puzzle scholars. Remains of the oldest surviving temples 
show that the main features of the Doric style were already estab¬ 
lished soon after 600 bce. It is possible that the temple s central 
unit, the cella and porch, derived from the plan of the Mycenaean 
megaron (see fig. 4.23), either through continuous tradition or by 
way of revival. If this is true, this relationship may reflect the 
revered place of Mycenaean culture in later Greek mythology. 
Still, a Doric column shaft tapers upward, not downward like the 
Minoan-Mycenaean column. This recalls fluted half-columns in 
the funerary precinct of Djoser at Saqqara of over 2,000 years 
earlier (see fig. 3.6). In fact, the very notion that temples should be 
built of stone and have large numbers of columns was an Egyptian 
one, even if Egyptian architects designed temples for greater 
internal traffic. Scholars believe that the rise of monumental stone 
architecture and sculpture must have been based on careful, on- 
the-spot study of Egyptian works and the techniques used to 
produce them. The opportunity for just such a study was 


available to Greek merchants living in trading camps in the 
western Nile Delta, by permission of the Egyptian king 
Psammetichus I (r. 664-610 bce). 

Some scholars see Doric architecture as a petrification (or 
turning to stone) of existing wooden forms, so that stone form 
follows wooden function. Accordingly, triglyphs once masked 
the ends of wooden beams, and the droplike shapes below, called 
guttae, mimick the wooden pegs that held them in place. Metopes 
evolved from boards that filled gaps between triglyphs to guard 
against moisture. Some derivations are more convincing than 
others, however. The vertical subdivisions of triglyphs hardly 
seem to reflect the forms of three half-round logs, as some have 
suggested, and column flutings need not have developed out of 
tool marks on a tree trunk, since Egyptian builders also fluted 
their columns and yet rarely used timber for supporting members. 
The question of how well function explains stylistic features faces 
the architectural historian repeatedly. 

DORIC TEMPLES AT PAESTUM Whatever the reason for the 
emergence of the Doric and Ionic styles, architects continued to 
refine them throughout Greek times. The early evolution of 
Doric temples is evident in two unusually well-preserved exam¬ 
ples located in the southern Italian polis of Paestum (ancient 
Poseidonia), where a Greek colony flourished during the Archaic 
period. The residents dedicated both temples to the goddess Hera, 
wife of Zeus; however, they built the Temple of Hera II almost a 
century after the Temple of Hera I (fig. 5.9). The differences in 
their proportions are striking. The Temple of Hera I (on the left

CHAPTER 5 GREEK ART 111 


























5.10 Interior of Temple of Hera II. ca. 500 bce 



of fig. 5.9) appears low and sprawling—and not just because so 
much of the entablature is missing—whereas the Temple of Hera 
II looks tall and compact. One reason is that the Temple of Hera I 
is enneastyle (with nine columns across the front and rear), while 
the later temple is only hexastyle (six columns). Yet the difference 
in appearance is also the result of changes to the outline of the 
columns. On neither temple are the column shafts straight from 
bottom to top. About a third of the way up, they bulge outward 
slightly, receding again at about two-thirds of their height. This 
swelling effect, known as entasis, is much stronger on the earlier 
Temple of Hera I. It gives the impression that the columns bulge 
with the strain of supporting the superstructure and that the slen¬ 
der tops, although aided by the widely flaring capitals, can barely 
withstand the crushing weight. The device, seen also in the mono¬ 
liths at Stonehenge, adds an extraordinary vitality to the build¬ 
ing—a sense of compressed energy awaiting release. 

Being so well preserved, the Temple of Hera II shows how the 
architect supported the ceiling in a large Doric temple (fig. 5.10). 
Inside the cella, the two rows of columns each support a smaller 
set of columns scaled in such a way that the tapering seems 
continuous despite the intervening architrave. Such a two-story 
interior is first found at the Temple of Aphaia at Aegina around 
the beginning of the fifth century bce. A reconstruction drawing 
of that temple (fig. 5.11) illustrates the structural system in detail. 

EARLY IONIC TEMPLES The Ionic style first appeared about 
a half-century after the Doric. With its vegetal decoration, it 
seems to have been strongly inspired by Near Eastern forms. 
The closest known parallel to the Ionic capital is the Aeolic cap¬ 
ital, found in the region of Old Smyrna, in eastern Greece, and in 
the northeast Aegean, itself apparently derived from North 
Syrian and Phoenician designs. Leading cities of Ionian Greece 
commissioned the earliest Ionic temples in open rivalry with one 
another. Little survives of these vast, ornate buildings. One of 
them, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos, gained tremendous

fame in antiquity, and earned a place among the seven wonders of 
the ancient world. The Ephesians hired Theodoros of Samos to 
work on its foundations in about 560 bce, shortly after he and 
another architect, Rhoikos, had designed a vast temple to Hera on 
the island of Samos. The temples subsequent architects, 
Chersiphron of Knossos and his son Metagenes, wrote a treatise 
on it. The temple was dipteral (with two rows of columns sur¬ 
rounding it) (fig. 5.12), and this feature emphasized the forestlike 
quality of the building, as did its vegetal capitals. In this much, it 
resembled the temple on Samos. Yet in other respects the Temple 
of Artemis clearly outshone Hera’s: It was larger, and it was the 
first monumental building constructed mostly of marble. These 
Ionic colossi had blatant symbolic value: They represented their 
respective city’s bid for regional leadership. 



STONE SCULPTURE 

According to literary sources, in the eighth century bce Greeks 
erected simple wooden sculptures of their gods for worship in 
sanctuaries; but since wood deteriorates, none of them now 
survives. In about 650 bce, sculptors, like architects, made the 
transition to working in stone, and so began one of the great 
traditions of Greek art. 

KORE AND KOUROS Early Greek statues clearly show affini¬ 
ties with the techniques and proportional systems used by 
Egyptian sculptors, whose work Greek artists could observe first 
hand in the Nile Delta. Two are illustrated here: one a small 
female figure of about 630 bce, probably from Crete (fig. 5.13); 
the other a life-size nude male youth of about 600 bce (fig. 5.14), 
known as the New York Kouros because it is displayed in the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Like their Egyptian forerunners 
(see figs. 3.10 and 3.11), the statues are rigidly frontal, and con¬ 
ceived as four distinct sides, reflecting the form of the block from 
which the sculptor carved them. Like Menkaure, the Greek male 
youth is slim and broad-shouldered; he stands with his left leg 
forward, and his arms by his sides, terminating in clenched fists. 
His shoulders, hips, and knees are all level. Both figures have styl¬ 
ized, wiglike hair like their Egyptian counterparts, and like some 
Near Eastern sculptures (see fig. 2.11). All the same, there are 
significant differences. First, the Greek sculptures are truly free¬ 
standing, without the back slab that supports Egyptian stone 
figures. In fact, they are the earliest large stone images of the 
human figure that can stand on their own. Moreover, Greek 
sculptures incorporated empty space (between the legs, for 
instance, or between arms and torso), whereas Egyptian figures 
remained embedded in stone, with the spaces between forms 
partly filled. Early Greek sculptures are also more stylized than 
their Egyptian forebears. This is most evident in the large staring 
eyes, emphasized by bold arching eyebrows, and in the linear 
treatment of the anatomy: The sculptor appears almost to have 
etched the male youth’s pectoral muscles and rib-cage onto the 
surface of the stone, whereas the Egyptian sculptor modeled 
Menkaure s musculature. Unlike Menkaure, the male youth is 
nude. Earlier cultures, like the Egyptians, forced nudity on slaves, 
whereas ancient Greeks considered public nudity acceptable for 
males, but not for females. Accordingly, like most early Greek 
female sculptures, this one is draped, in a close-fitting garment 
that reveals her breasts but conceals her hips and legs. 

Dozens of Archaic sculptures of this kind survive throughout 
the Greek world. Some have come to light in sanctuaries and 
cemeteries, but most were found in reused contexts, which 
complicates any attempt to understand their function. Scholars 
describe them by the Greek terms for maiden (kore, plural korai) 
and youth (kouros, plural kouroi), terms that gloss over the

difficulty of identifying their function. Some bear inscriptions, 
such as the names of artists (“‘So-and-so’ made me”) or dedica¬ 
tions to various deities, chiefly Apollo. The latter, then, were 
votive offerings. But in most cases we do not know whether the 
sculptures represent the donor, a deity, or a person deemed 
divinely favored, such as a victor in the athletic games that were 
so central to ancient Greek life. Those placed on graves probably 
represent the person buried beneath. 


Sculptors made no clear effort to give the statues portrait fea¬ 
tures, so the images can represent an individual only in a general 
way. It might make sense to think of them as ideals of physical 
perfection and vitality shared by mortals and immortals alike, 
given meaning by their physical context. What is clear is that only 
the wealthy could afford them, since many were well over life- 
size and carved from high-quality marble. Indeed, the very stylis¬ 
tic cohesion of the sculptures may reveal their social function: By

erecting a sculpture of this kind, a wealthy patron declared his or 
her status and claimed membership in ruling elite circles. 

DATING AND NATURALISM The Archaic period stretches 
from the mid-seventh century to about 480 bce. Within this time 
frame, there are few secure dates for free-standing sculptures. 
Scholars have therefore established a dating system based upon 
the level of naturalism in a given sculpture. According to this 
system, the more stylized the figure, the earlier it must be. 
Comparing figures 5.14 and 5.15 illustrates how this model 
works. An inscription on the base of the latter identifies it as the 
funerary statue of Kroisos, who died a hero’s death in battle. Like 
all such figures, it was painted, and traces of color are still 
discernible in the hair and the pupils of the eyes. Instead of the 
sharp planes and linear treatment of the New York Kouros (see fig. 
5.14), the sculptor of the kouros from Anavysos modeled its 
anatomy with swelling curves; a viewer can imagine flesh and 
sinew and bones in the carved stone. A greater plasticity gives the 
impression that the body could actually function. The propor¬ 
tions of the facial features are more naturalistic as well. The face 
has a less masklike quality than the New York Kouros , though the 
lips are drawn up in an artificial smile, known as the Archaic 
smile, that is not reflected in the eyes. Based on these differences, 
scholars judge the Kroisos more "advanced” than the New York 
Kouros , and date it some 75 years later. Given the later trajectory 
of Greek sculpture, there is every reason to believe that this way 
of dating Archaic sculpture is more or less accurate (accounting 
for regional differences and the like). All the same, it is worth 
emphasizing that it is based on an assumption—that sculptors, or 
their patrons, were striving toward naturalism—rather than on 
factual data. 

There is more variation in types of kore than in types of 
kouros. This is partly because a kore is a clothed figure and there¬ 
fore presents the problem of how to relate body and drapery. It is 
also likely to reflect changing habits or local styles of dress. The 
kore in figure 5.16, from about 520 bce, was a dedication on the 
Akropolis of Athens, though she probably came from Chios, an 
island of Ionian Greece. She has none of the severity of the earlier 
kore from Crete. She wears the light Ionian chiton (a rectangle of 
fabric draped and fastened at the shoulder by pins) under the 
heavier diagonally shaped himation, which replaced the earlier 
peplos (plain woolen garment) in fashion. The layers of the gar¬ 
ment still loop around the body in soft curves, but the play of 
richly differentiated folds, pleats, and textures has almost become 
an end in itself. Color played an important role in such works, 
and is unusually well preserved in this example. 

Architectural Sculpture: 

The Building Comes Alive 

Soon after the Greeks began to dedicate stone temples, they also 
started to use architectural sculpture to articulate their buildings 
and bring them to life. Indeed, early Greek architects such as 
Theodoros of Samos were often sculptors as well. Traces of 


pigment show that these sculptures were normally vividly 
painted. (See Materials and Technique s, page 223.) 

The Egyptians had been covering walls and columns with 
reliefs since the Old Kingdom. Their carvings were so shallow 
(see fig. 3.28) that they did not break the continuity of the surface 
and had no volume of their own. Thus, like the reliefs on 
Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian buildings, they related to their 
architectural setting in the same way as wall paintings (see figs. 
2.19 and 2.20). Another kind of architectural sculpture in the 
Near East, however, seems to have begun with the Hittites: the 
lamassu protruding from stone blocks that framed the gateways 
of fortresses or palaces (see fig. 2.22). Directly or indirectly, this 
tradition may have inspired the carving over the Lioness Gate at 
Mycenae (see fig. 4.22). 

THE TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS, CORFU The facade of the early 
Archaic Temple of Artemis on the island of Corfu, built soon 
after 600 bce, suggests that the Lioness Gate relief, which was still 
visible in the sixth century, is a conceptual ancestor of later Greek 
architectural sculpture (figs. 5.17 and 5.18). Sculpture on the 
temple is confined to the pediment, a triangle between the ceiling 
and the roof that serves as a screen to protect the wooden rafters 
behind it from moisture. Technically, the pedimental sculptures 
are in high relief, like the guardian lionesses at Mycenae. 
However, the sculptor undercut the figures so strongly that 
they are nearly detached from the background, and appear to be 
almost independent of their architectural setting. Indeed, the head 
of the central figure actually overlaps the frame; she seems to 
emerge out of the pediment toward a viewer. This choice on the 
sculptor s part heightens the impact of the figure and strengthens 
her function. 

Although the Greeks of Corfu dedicated their temple to 
Artemis, the figure represents the snake-haired Medusa, one of

the Gorgon sisters of Greek mythology. Medusa’s appearance was 
so monstrous, the story went, that anyone who beheld her would 
turn to stone. With the aid of the gods, the hero Perseus managed 
to behead her using her reflection in his shield to guide his sword. 
Traditionally, art historians have interpreted the figure of Medusa 
as a protective device, used to ward evil spirits away from the 
temple. However, scholars now argue that she served as a visual 
commentary on the power of the divinity: As a mistress of ani¬ 
mals, she exemplifies the goddess’ power and dominance over 
Nature. To emphasize this, two large feline creatures flank 
Medusa, in a heraldic arrangement known from the Lioness Gate 
and from earlier Near Eastern examples. 

To strengthen the sculptures’ message, the designer included 
narrative elements in the pediment as well. In the spaces between 
and behind the main group, the sculptor inserted subsidiary fig¬ 
ures. On either side of Medusa are her children, the winged horse 
Pegasus, and Chrysaor, who will be born from drops of the blood 
she sheds when Perseus decapitates her. Pegasus was a symbol of 
Corinth. Since Corfu was Corinth’s colony, the winged horse 
reminded residents of Corinth’s control. Logically speaking, 
Pegasus and Chrysaor cannot yet exist, since Medusa’s head is still 
on her shoulders; and yet their presence in the heraldic arrang- 
ment alludes to the future, when Perseus will have claimed the 
Gorgon’s power as his own—just as the sculptor has here, in the 
service of Artemis. To bring the story to life, the sculptor fused 
two separate moments from a single story, in what is known as a 
synoptic narrative. Two additional groups filled the pediment’s 
corners. They may depict Zeus and Poseidon battling the giants (a 
gigantomachy), a mortal race who tried to overthrow the gods. If 
so, they strike a cautionary note for a viewer, warning mortals not 
to aim higher than their natural place in the order of things, since 
the gods destroyed the giants for their overreaching ambitions. 

With their reclining pose, the felines fit the shape of the pedi¬ 
ment comfortably. Yet in order to fit Pegasus and Chrysaor 
between Medusa and the felines, and the groups into the corners, 


the sculptor carved them at a significantly smaller scale than the 
dominant figures. Later solutions to the pediment’s awkward 
shape suggest that this one, which lacks unity of scale, was not 
wholly satisfactory. 

Aside from filling the pediment with sculpture, Greeks often 
affixed free-standing figures, known as acroteria, above the cor¬ 
ners and center of the pediment, to soften the severity of its out¬ 
line (see fig. 5.20). In Ionic buildings, female statues or caryatids 
might substitute for columns to support the roof of a porch (see 
figs. 5.20 and 5.51). Sculptors also decorated the frieze. In Doric 
temples, they would often embellish the metopes with figural 
scenes. In Ionic temples, they treated the frieze with a continuous 
band of painted or sculpted decoration. For the frieze as for the 
pediment, the designer frequently selected mythological subjects 
with a topical relevance. 

THE SIPHNIAN TREASURY, DELPHI These Ionic features 
came together in a building constructed at Delphi shortly before 
525 bce by the people of the Ionian island of Siphnos. Delphi was 
the site of an important Panhellenic sanctuary to Apollo, to which 
people traveled from all over Greece to consult its oracle (fig. 
5.19). The sanctuary gradually came to incorporate a theater and 
a stadium as well as several temples. Individuals and cities made 
dedications there, such as statues and spoils of war, and many 
cities built treasuries on the course of the principal thoroughfare, 
the Processional Way, to store their votive offerings. Treasuries 
resembled miniature temples, and typically had an ornate quality. 
Although the Treasury of the Siphnians no longer stands, archae¬ 
ologists can reconstruct its appearance from surviving blocks 
(figs. 5.20 and 5.21). Two caryatids supported the architrave of 
the porch. Above the architrave was a magnificent sculptural 
frieze (see fig. 5.21), part of which depicts the mythical battle of 
the gods against the giants, possibly also seen at Corfu. At the far 
left, the two lions pull the chariot of Themis, and tear apart an 
anguished giant. In front of them, Apollo and Artemis advance

together, shooting arrows, originally added in metal, into a 
phalanx of giants. Stripped of his armor, a dead giant lies at their 
feet. Though the subject is mythical, its depiction provides 
historians with a wealth of detail on contemporary weaponry and 
military tactics. 

Astonishingly, the relief is only a few inches deep from front 
to back. Within that shallow space, the sculptors (scholars discern 
more than one hand) created several planes. They carved the arms 
and legs of those nearest a viewer in the round. In the second and 
third layers, the forms become shallower, yet even those farthest 
from a viewer do not merge into the background. The resulting 
relationships between figures give a dramatic sense of the turmoil 
of battle and an intensity of action not seen before in narrative 
reliefs. As at Corfu, the protagonists fill the sculptural field from 
top to bottom, and this compositional choice enhances the frieze s 
power. It is a dominant characteristic of Archaic and Classical 
Greek art, and in time sculptors sought ways to fill the triangular 
field of the pediment, too, while retaining a unity of scale. Taking

their cue, perhaps, from friezes such as that found on the Siphnian 
Treasury, they introduced a variety of poses for figures, and made 
great strides in depicting the human body in naturalistic motion. 
The pediments of the Temple of Aphaia at Aegina illustrate this 
well (see fig. 5.11). 

PEDIMENTS OF THE TEMPLE OF APHAIA AT AEGINA 

In ca. 480 bce, the Aeginetans replaced the sculptures in the east 
pediment of their Temple of Aphaia. Scholars hypothesize that 
the Persian invasion of Greece may have caused damage to the 
earlier sculptures. The new pediment (fig. 5.22) depicts the first 
sack of Troy, by Herakles and Telamon, king of Salamis. The west 
pediment, which was not replaced at the time and dates from 
about 500-490 bce, shows the second siege of Troy (recounted in 
The Iliad) by the Greek king Agamemnon, who was related to 
Herakles. The pairing of subjects commemorates the important 
role the heroes of Aegina played in both legendary battles—and, 
by extension, at Salamis, where their navy helped to overcome the 
Persians in 480. The use of allegory to elevate historical events to 
a universal plane is a frequent strategy in Greek art. 

The figures of both pediments are fully in the round, inde¬ 
pendent of the stone background. For centuries, those of the east 
pediment lay in pieces on the ground, and scholars now debate 
their exact arrangement. All the same, they can determine the 
relative position of each figure within the pediment with reason¬ 
able accuracy, since the designer introduced a range of action 
poses for the figures, so their height, but not their scale , varies to 
suit the gently sloping sides of the pedimental field. In the center 
stands the goddess Athena, presiding over the battle between 
Greeks and Trojans that rages on either side of her. Kneeling

archers shoot across the pediment to unite its action. The sym¬ 
metrical arrangement of poses on the two halves of the pediment 
creates a balanced design, so that while each figure has a clear 
autonomy, it also exists within a governing ornamental pattern. 

A comparison of a fallen warrior from the west pediment (fig. 
5.23) with its counterpart from the later east pediment (fig. 5.24) 
exposes the extraordinary advances sculptors made toward natu¬ 
ralism during the decades that separate them. As they sink to the 
ground in death, both figures present a clever solution to filling 
the difficult corner space. Yet while the earlier figure props him¬ 
self up on one arm, only a precariously balanced shield supports 
the later warrior, whose full weight seems to pull him irresistibly 
to the ground. Both sculptors contorted their subjects’ bodies in 
the agonies of death: The earlier sculptor crosses the warrior s legs 
in an awkward pose, while the later sculptor twists the body from 
the waist, so that the left shoulder moves into a new plane. 
Although the later warrior s anatomy still does not fully respond 
to his pose (note, for instance, how little the pectorals stretch to 
accommodate the strenuous motion of the right arm, and the 
misplaced navel), his body is more modeled and organic than the 
earlier warrior s. He also breaks from the head-on stare of his 
predecessor, turning his gaze to the ground that confronts him. 


The effect suggests introspection: The inscrutable smiling mask of 
the earlier warrior yields to the suffering and emotion of a war¬ 
rior in his final moments of life. Depictions of suffering, and how 
humans respond to it, are among the most dramatic developments 
of late Archaic art. 

Vase Painting: Art of the Symposium 

A similar experimentation with figural poses and emotion 
occurred in Archaic vase painting, which replaced the 
Orientalizing style as workshops in Athens and other centers 
began to produce extremely fine wares, painted with scenes from 
mythology, legend, and everyday life. The difference between 
Orientalizing and Archaic vase painting is largely one of tech¬ 
nique. On the aryballos from Corinth (see fig. 5.5), the figures 
appear partly as solid silhouettes, partly in outline, or as a combi¬ 
nation of the two. Toward the end of the seventh century bce, 
influenced by Corinthian products, Attic vase painters began to 
work in the black-figured technique: They painted the entire 
design in black silhouette against the reddish clay, and then 
incised internal details into the design with a needle. Next, they 
painted white and purple over the black to make chosen areas

stand out. The technique lent itself to a two-dimensional and 
highly decorative effect. This development marks the beginning 
of an aggressive export industry, the main consumers of which 
were the Etruscans. Vast numbers of black-figured vases were 
found in Etruscan tombs. Thus, although in terms of conception 
these vases (and later red-figured vessels) represent a major chap¬ 
ter in Greek (and specifically Athenian) art, with regard to their 
actual use, painted vases are a major component of Etruscan 
culture, both visual and funerary. 


Greeks used the vases illustrated in these pages to hold wine. 
For everyday use, they generally poured wine from plainer, 
unadorned vases. They reserved decorated vases for special occa¬ 
sions, like the symposium ( symposion ), an exclusive drinking 
party that was a central feature of Greek life. Symposia were 
exclusively for men and courtesans; wives and other respectable 
citizen women did not attend. Participants reclined on couches 
around the edges of a room, and a master of ceremonies filled 
their cups from a large painted mixing bowl (a krater) at the 


120 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 






center. Music, poetry, storytelling, and word games accompanied 
the festivities. Often the event ended in lovemaking, which is 
frequently depicted on drinking cups. Sometimes this was homo¬ 
sexual in orientation, since it was not unusual in the fifth century 
bce for a mature Greek man to have a younger male lover, for 
whom he acted as a social and political mentor. There was also a 
serious side to symposia, as described by Plato and Xenophon, 
which centered on debates about politics, ethics, and morality. 
The great issues that Greeks pondered in their philosophy, litera¬ 
ture, and theater—the nature of virtue, the value of an individual 
mans life, or mortal relations with the gods, to name a few—were 
mirrored in, and prompted by, the images with which they 
surrounded themselves. 

After the middle of the sixth century bce, many of the finest 
vessels bear the signatures of the artists who made them, indicat¬ 
ing the pride that potters and painters alike took in their work. In 
many cases, vase painters had such distinctive styles that scholars 
can recognize their work even without a signature, and use mod¬ 
ern names to identify them. Dozens of vases (in one instance, over 
200) might survive by the same hand, allowing scholars to trace a 
single painter’s development over many years. 

A fine example of the black-figured technique is an Athenian 
amphora signed by Exekias as both potter and painter, dating to 
the third quarter of the sixth century bce (fig. 5.25). The painting 
shows the Homeric heroes Achilles and Ajax playing dice. The 
episode does not exist in surviving literary sources, and its appear¬ 
ance here hints at a wide field of lost traditions that may have 
inspired Exekias. The two figures lean on their spears; their 
shields are stacked behind them against the inside of a campaign 
tent. The black silhouettes create a rhythmical composition, sym¬ 
metrical around the table in the center. Within the black paint, 
Exekias incised a wealth of detail, focusing especially upon the 
warriors’ cloaks; their intricately woven texture contrasts with the 
lustrous blackness of their weapons. 

The extraordinary power of this scene derives from the ten¬ 
sion within it. The warriors have stolen a moment of relaxation 
during a fierce war; even so, poised on the edge of their stools, one 
heel raised as if to spring into action, their poses are edgy. An 
inscription on the right reads “three,” as if Ajax is calling out his 
throw. Achilles, who in his helmet slightly dominates the scene, 
answers with “four,” making him the winner. Yet many Greek 
viewers would have understood the irony of the scene, for when 
they return to battle, Achilles will die, and Ajax will be left to bear 
his friend s lifeless body back to the Greek camp, before falling on 
his own sword in despair. Indeed, Exekias himself would paint 
representations of the heroes’ tragic deaths. This amphora is the 
first known representation of the gaming scene, which subse¬ 
quently became popular, suggesting that vase paintings did not 
exist in artistic isolation; painters responded to one another’s 
work in a close and often clever dialogue. 

Athenian vase painters seem to have intended most of the 
scenes on their vessels for a male audience. There are cases, how¬ 
ever, when vases reflect female life and appear to be intended for 
a female audience. A black-figured hydria (water jar) by the 


Priam Painter is one such vase (fig. 5.26). The belly of the water 
jug shows a scene in a columned fountain house, where three 
women collect water into hydriai from animal-headed spigots, 
and a fourth supports a hydria on her head. Their poses, with 
knees and arms raised, allow the painter to experiment with 
figural movement. The animated gesture of a fifth woman reflects 
the fact that, for Athenian women, the daily outing to the public 
fountain house was the only opportunity to leave the confines of 
the home; the fountain house represented a rare chance to social¬ 
ize outside the immediate family. 

Despite its decorative potential, the silhouettelike black-fig¬ 
ured technique limited artists to incision for detail, leading them 
to develop the reverse procedure of leaving the figures red and 
filling in the background. This red-figured technique gradually 
replaced the older method between 520 and 500 bce. The effects 
of the change would become increasingly evident in the decades 
to come, but they are already discernible on an amphora of about

510-500 bce, signed by Euthymides (fig. 5.27). No longer is the 
scene so dependent on profiles. The painter s new freedom with 
the brush translates into a freedom of movement in the dancing 
revelers he represents. They cavort in a range of poses, twisting 
their bodies and showing off Euthymides 5 confidence in render¬ 
ing human anatomy. The shoulder blades of the central figure, for 
instance, one higher than the other, reflect the motion of his raised 
arm. The turning poses allow Euthymides to tackle foreshorten¬ 
ing, as he portrays the different planes of the body (the turning 
shoulders, for instance) on a single surface. This was an age of 
intensive and self-conscious experimentation; indeed, so pleased 
was Euthymides with his painting that he inscribed a taunting 
challenge to a fellow painter: “As never Euphronios. ” 

On a slightly later kylix (wine cup) by Douris, dating to 
490-480 bce, Eos, the goddess of dawn, tenderly lifts the limp 
body of her dead son, Memnon, whom Achilles killed after their 
mothers sought the intervention of Zeus (fig. 5.28). Douris traces 
the contours of limbs beneath the drapery, and balances vigorous 
outlines with more delicate secondary strokes, such as those indi¬ 
cating the anatomical details of Memnon s body. The dead weight 
of Memnon s body contrasts with the lift of Eos 5 wings, an ironic 
commentary, perhaps, on how Zeus decided between the two 
warriors by weighing their souls on a scale that tipped against

Memnon. After killing him, Achilles stripped off Memnons 
armor as an act of humiliation, and where the figures overlap in 
the image, the gentle folds of Eos’ flowing chiton set off 
Memnons nudity. His vulnerability in turn underlines his 
mother’s desperate grief at being unable to help her son. 

At the core of the image is raw emotion. Douris tenderly 
exposes the suffering caused by intransigent fate, and the callous¬ 
ness of the gods who intervene in mortal lives. In this mytholog¬ 
ical scene, Athenians may have seen a reflection of themselves 
during the horrors of the Persian Wars of 490-479 bce. Indeed, an 
inscription brings the vase into the realm of everyday life, with 
the signatures of both painter and potter, as well as a dedication 
typical of Greek vases: “Hermogenes is beautiful. ” 

THE CLASSICAL AGE 

The beginning of the fifth century bce brought crisis. A number 
of Ionian cities rebelled against their Persian overlords, and after 
Athens came to their support, the Persians invaded the Greek 
mainland, under the leadership of Darius I. At the Battle of 
Marathon in 490 bce, a contingent of about 10,000 Athenians, 
with a battalion from nearby Plataea, repulsed a force of about 
90,000 Persians. Ten years later, an even larger force of Persians 
returned under Darius’ son, Xerxes I. Defeating a Spartan force at 
Thermopylae, they took control of Athens, burning and pillaging 
temples and statues. The Greeks fought them again at Salamis and 
Plataea in 480-479 bce, and finally defeated them. These battles 
were defining moments for the Greeks, who first faced destruc¬ 
tion in their cities, and then emerged triumphant and confident 
after the horrors of invasion. At least in Athens, Persian destruc¬ 
tion of public monuments and space is visible in the archaeologi¬ 
cal record, and, for archaeologists and art historians, signals the 
end of the Archaic period. The period stretching from the end of 
the Persian Wars to the death of Alexander the Great in the late 
fourth century bce is known as the Classical Age. During this 
time, architects and sculptors alike sought visual harmony in pro¬ 
portional systems, and artists achieved a heightened naturalism in 
depicting the human form. 

The struggle against the Persians tested the recently estab¬ 
lished Athenian democracy. Athens emerged from the war as the 
leader of the Delian League, a defensive alliance against the 
Persians, which quickly evolved into a political and economic 
empire that facilitated many architectural and artistic projects. 
The Classical era was when the playwrights whose names are 
still so familiar—Aristophanes, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and 
Euripides—were penning comedies and tragedies for perform¬ 
ance at religious festivals, and thinkers like Socrates and Plato, and 
then Aristotle, engaged in their philosophical quests. Perhaps the 
most influential political leader of the day was Perikles, who came 
to the forefront of Athenian public life in the mid-fifth century 
bce, and played a critical role in the city’s history until his death 
in 429 bce. An avid patron of the arts, he focused much of his 
attention on beautifying the city’s highest point or Akropolis. 


Classical Sculpture 

The Persian sack of 480 bce left the Athenian Akropolis in ruins. 
Among many statues that were once dedications there and were 
later excavated from the debris, one kouros stands apart (fig. 
5.29). Archaeologists sometimes attribute it to the Athenian 
sculptor Kritios, and know it as the Kritios Boy. On account of its

findspot, they date it to shortly before the Persian attack. It dif¬ 
fers significantly from earlier, Archaic kouroi (see figs. 5.14 and 
5.15), not least because it is the first surviving statue that stands in 
the full sense of the word. Although the earlier figures are in an 
upright position—instead of reclining, sitting, kneeling, or run¬ 
ning—their stance is really an arrested walk, with the body’s 
weight resting evenly on both legs. This pose is nonnaturalistic 


and rigid. The Kritios Boy has one leg forward like earlier kouroi, 
yet an important change has occurred. The sculptor has shifted 
the youth s weight, creating a calculated asymmetry in the two 
sides of his body. The knee of the forward leg is lower than the 
other, the right hip is thrust down and in, and the left hip up and 
out. The axis of the body is not a straight vertical line, but a 
reversed S-curve. Taken together, these small departures from 
symmetry indicate that the youth s weight rests mainly on the left 
leg, while the right leg acts as a prop to help balance the body 

The Kritios Boy not only stands; he stands at ease. The artist 
masterfully observed the balanced asymmetry of this relaxed nat¬ 
ural stance, which is known to ancient art historians as a chiastic 
pose (from “%,” the Greek letter chi), and to Renaissance art his¬ 
torians as contrapposto (Italian for “counterpoise”). The leg that 
carries the main weight is called the engaged leg, the other, the free 
leg. This simple observation led to radical results, for with it came 
a recognition that if one part of the body is engaged in a task, 
other parts respond. Bending the free knee results in a slight 
swiveling of the pelvis, a compensating curvature of the spine, 
and an adjusting tilt of the shoulders. This unified approach to 
the body led artists to represent movement with a new natural¬ 
ism. Indeed, even though the Kritios Boy is at rest, his muscles 
suggest motion, and the sculpture has life; he seems capable of 
action. At the same time, the artist recognized that strict adher¬ 
ence to nature would not always yield the desired result. So, as 
in the later Parthenon (see pages 131-37), refinements are at 
work. The sculptor exaggerated the line of muscles over the pelvis 
to create a greater unity between thighs and torso, and a more 
fluid transition from front to back. This emphasized the sculp¬ 
ture s three-dimensionality, and encouraged a viewer to move 
around it. 

The innovative movement in the musculature gives a viewer 
the sense, for the first time, that muscles lie beneath the surface of 
the marble skin, and that a skeleton articulates the whole as a real 
organism. A new treatment of the flesh and the marble s surface 
adds to this impression: The flesh has a soft sensuousness that is 
quite alien to earlier kouroi, and the sculptor has worked the sur¬ 
face of the marble to a gentle polish. Gone, also, is the Archaic 
smile. The face has a soft fleshiness to it, especially marked around 
the chin, which is characteristic of sculpture in the early Classical 
period. The head is turned slightly away from the front, removing 
the direct gaze of earlier kouroi and casting the figure into his 
own world of thought. 

A sculpture discovered in the Graeco-Punic settlement of 
Motya in western Sicily exhibits a similar sensuousness (see map 
5.1 and fig. 5.30). Like the Kritios Boy , it represents a youth stand¬ 
ing in a sinuous chiastic pose, his head turned from a frontal axis. 
The sculptor has used the fine fabric of a charioteer s tunic to 
“mask” the full curves of the body, revealing the flesh while 
simultaneously concealing it. Athletic contests were a prominent 
component of male life in Greece and its colonies. Greeks viewed 
physical prowess as a virtue, and victors in games won a measure 
of fame. Sculptures like this one, set up in public places, com¬ 
memorated their success.

The Kritios Boy marks a critical point in Greek art. One of the 
changes it engendered was a wholehearted exploration of the rep¬ 
resentation of movement, another hallmark of early Classical 
sculpture. A magnificent nude bronze dating to about 460-450 
bce recovered from the sea near the Greek coast (fig. 5.31) was 
probably in the cargo of a Roman vessel that sank on its voyage 
to Italy. At almost 7 feet tall, it depicts a spread-eagled male fig¬ 
ure in the act of throwing—probably Zeus casting a thunderbolt, 


or Poseidon throwing his trident. In a single figure, the sculptor 
captures and contrasts vigorous action and firm stability. The 
result is a work of outright grandeur, expressing the god s awe¬ 
inspiring power. The piece shows off not only the artist s under¬ 
standing of bodies in motion, but also an expert knowledge of the 
strengths of bronze, which allowed the god s arms to stretch out 
without support. (See Materials and Techniques , page 128.) Some 
ten years later, in about 450 bce, a sculptor named Myron created a 


CHAPTER 5 GREEK ART 125

bronze statue of another athlete, a discus thrower, the Diskobolos , 
which earned great renown in its own time. Like most Greek 
sculptures in bronze, it is known to us only from Roman copies 
(fig. 5.32). (See www.myartslab.com. ) If the bronze Zeus suggested 
impending motion by portraying the moment before it occurred, 
Myron condensed a sequence of movements into a single pose, 
achieved through a violent twist of the torso that brings the arms 
into the same plane as the legs. The pose conveys the essence of 
the action by presenting the coiled figure in perfect balance. 

THE DORYPHOROSZ IDEALS OF PROPORTION AND 
HARMONY Within half a century of the innovations witnessed 
in the Kritios Boy , sculptors were avidly exploring the body’s 
articulation. One of those sculptors was Polykleitos of Argos, 
whose most famous work, the Doryphoros (Spear Bearer) (fig.

5.33) , is known to us through numerous Roman copies. In this 
sculpture, the chiastic pose is much more emphatic than in the 
Kritios Boy , the turn of the head more pronounced. Polykleitos 
seems to delight in the possibilities the pose offers, examining 
how the anatomy on the two sides of the body responds to it. 
The “working” left arm balances the engaged right leg in the for¬ 
ward position, and the relaxed right arm balances the free left leg. 
Yet, in this sculpture, Polykleitos did more than study anatomy. 
He explored principles of commensurability, symmetria , where 
part related to part, and all the parts to the whole: He proposed 
an ideal system of proportions, not just for individual elements 
of the body but for their relation to one another and to the 
body as a whole. He also addressed rhythmos (composition and 
movement). According to one ancient writer, Greeks knew this 
work as his kanon (canon, meaning “rule” or “measure”). (See 
www.myartslab.com. ) Egyptian artists had earlier aimed to estab¬ 
lish guidelines for depiction based on proportion. Yet for 
Polykleitos, the search for an ideal system of proportions was 
more than an artist s aid: It was rooted in a philosophical quest for 
illumination, and in a belief that harmony ( harmonia )—in the 
universe, as in music and in all things—could be expressed in 
mathematical terms. Only slightly later than this sculpture, Plato 
would root his doctrine of ideal forms in numbers, and acknowl¬ 
edge that beauty was commonly based on proportion. 
Philosophers even referred to works of art to illustrate their 
theories. Moreover, beauty was more than an idle conceit for 
Classical Athenians; it also had a moral dimension. Pose and 
expression reflected character and feeling, which revealed the 
inner person and, with it, arete (excellence or virtue). Thus con¬ 
templation of harmonious proportions could be equated with the 
contemplation of virtue. (See Brimary Source , page 133.) 

Much of the Doryphoros 3 original appearance may have been 
lost in the copy-making process: Bronze and marble differ greatly 
in both texture and presence. Surviving Greek bronzes are 
extremely rare, and when a pair of over-life-size figures was found 
in the sea near Riace, Italy, in 1972, they created a sensation (fig. 

5.34) . Their state of preservation is outstanding, and shows off to 
advantage the extraordinarily fine workmanship. Greek sculptors 
used a refined version of the lost-wax technique familiar to Near 
Eastern artists. The process differs radically from cutting away 
stone, since the technique is additive (the artist builds the clay 
model in the first phase of the process). Further, where marble 
absorbs light, a bronze surface reflects it, and this led sculptors to 
explore a variety of surface textures—for hair and skin, for 
instance. They could add different materials for details: These 
statues have ivory and glass-paste eyes, bronze eyelashes, and 
copper lips and nipples. Statue A (or Riace Warrior A ), shown 
here, has silver teeth. Who these figures represented is still 
unknown: a pair of heroes, perhaps, or warriors. They may have 
formed part of a single monument. Though they strike similar 
poses, the men have differing body types, which has led some 
scholars to date them apart and attribute them to two separate 
sculptors. They could equally be the work of a single artist 
exploring the representation of character and age.

Greeks customarily celebrated great men. There, they were in the

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


The Indirect Lost-Wax Process 


Z eus (see fig. 5.31) is one of the earliest surviving Greek statues 
that was made by the indirect lost-wax process. This technique 
enables sculptors to create spatially freer forms than they can in stone. 
They make projecting limbs separately and solder them onto the 
torso, and no longer need to support them using unsightly struts. 
Compare, for example, the freely outstretched arms of the Zeus with 
the strut extending from hip to drapery on the Aphrodite of Knidos 
(see fig. 5.56). 

The Egyptians, Minoans, and early Greeks had often made statuettes 
of solid bronze using the direct lost-wax process. The technique was 
simple. The sculptor modeled his figure in wax; covered it with clay to 
form a mold; heated out the wax; melted copper and tin in the ratio of 
nine parts to one in a crucible; and poured this alloy into the space left 
by the “lost wax” in the clay mold. Yet, because figures made in this 
way were solid, the method had severe limitations. A solid-cast life- 
size statue would have been prohibitively expensive, incredibly heavy, 
and prone to developing bubbles and cracks as the alloy cooled. So 
from the eighth through the sixth centuries bce, the Greeks developed 
the indirect lost-wax method, which allowed them to cast statues 
hollow and at any scale. 

First, the sculptor shaped a core of clay into the basic form of the 
intended metal statue, before covering this core with a layer of wax to 
the thickness of the final metal casting, and carving the details of the 
statue carefully in the wax. The figure was then sectioned into its com¬ 
ponent parts—head, torso, limbs, and so on. For each part, the artist 
applied a heavy outer layer of clay over the wax and secured it to the 


inner core with metal pegs. The package was then heated to melt the 
wax, which ran out. Molten metal—usually bronze, but sometimes 
silver or gold—was then poured into the space left by this “lost wax.” 
When the molten metal cooled, the outer and inner molds were broken 
away, leaving a metal casting—the statue’s head, torso, or arm—and 
these individual sections were then soldered together to create the 
statue. The sculptor completed the work by polishing the surface, 
chiseling details such as strands of hair and skin folds, and inlaying 
features such as eyes, teeth, lips, nipples, and dress patterns in ivory, 
stone, glass, copper, or precious metal.

as ornamentation. The chief temple in the sanctuary at Olympia 
honored Zeus. Spoils from a victory of Elis over its neighbor Pisa 
in 470 bce provided funds for the temples construction, to a 
design by the architect Libon from Elis. Its fragmentary pedi¬ 
ments, perhaps the work of Ageladas from nearby Argos in about 
460 bce, are highpoints of the early Classical style, and are 
reassembled in the Archaeological Museum at Olympia. In the 
east pediment, mythology provides an analogy for the recent vic¬ 
tory, as at Aegina. The subject is the triumph of Pelops over 
Oinomaos, king of Pisa, in a chariot race, for which the prize was 
the hand of the king s daughter, Hippodameia. Pelops (for whom 
the Peloponnesos is named) was an important figure for Greeks, 
for they credited him with founding the athletic games at 
Olympia. Yet he prevailed in the race by trickery, with the result 
that he and his descendants, including Agamemnon, king of 
Mycenae, lived under a curse. Thus, the myth was topical in a 
second way: Pelops’ example served as a warning against foul play 
to Olympic contestants as they paraded past the temple. 

The west pediment represents the struggle of the Lapiths, a 
tribe from Thessaly, with the centaurs (a centauromachy) (fig. 
5.35). Centaurs were the offspring of Ixion, king of the Lapiths, 
and Hera, whom he tried to seduce while in Olympos (with 
the result that Ixion was chained forever to a fiery wheel in 
Tartarus). As half-brothers of the Lapiths, the centaurs were 
guests at the wedding of the Lapith king Peirithoos and 
Deidameia. Unable to tolerate alcohol, they got into a drunken 
brawl with the Lapiths, who subdued them with the aid of 
Peirithoos’ friend Theseus. 

At the center of the composition stands the commanding fig¬ 
ure of Apollo. His outstretched right arm, the strong turn of his 
head, and his powerful gaze show his engagement in the drama, as 
he wills the Lapiths to victory. At the same time, his calm, static 
pose removes him from the action unfolding around him; he does 
not help physically. To the left of Apollo, the centaur king, 
Eurytion, has seized Hippodameia. Both figures are massive and 
simple in form, with soft contours and undulating surfaces. The 
artist entangled them in a compact interlocking group, which is 
quite different from the individual conflicts of the Aegina figures. 
Moreover, the artist expressed their struggle in more than action 
and gesture: The centaur’s face mirrors his anguish, and his pain 
and desperate effort contrast vividly with the calm on the young 
bride’s face. In setting the centaurs’ evident suffering against the 
emotionlessness of the Lapiths, the pediment draws a moral dis¬ 
tinction between the bestial centaurs and the civilized humans, 
who share in Apollo’s remote nobility. Apollo, god of music and 
poetry but also of light and reason, epitomizes rational behavior 
in the face of adversity. By partaking in divine reason, humans tri¬ 
umph over animal nature. This conflict between the rational and 
the irrational, order and chaos, lay at the heart of Greek art, both 
in its subject matter and in its very forms. It exposes the Greeks’ 
sense of themselves, representing civilization in the face of barbar- 
ianism—always neatly encapsulated in the Persians. 

Like the west pediment, the east pediment may have had a 
local relevance, encouraging fair play among Olympic competitors. 


The metopes were certainly topical: They depict the labors of 
Herakles, Pelops’ great-grandson, who according to legend laid 
out the stadium at Olympia. Narrative scenes had been a feature 
of metopes since the early sixth century bce, but at Olympia the 
designer exploited the pictorial and dramatic possibilities fully for 
the first time. The metope illustrated here, which was inserted 
prominently over the entrance on the temple’s east side, shows 
Atlas returning to Herakles with the apples of the Hesperides (fig. 
5.36). Atlas was one of the Titans, the race of gods before the 
Olympians, and it was his charge to support the Earth on his 
shoulders. Herakles agreed to hold the world for him, and thus 
persuaded Atlas to go to the gardens of the Hesperides to fetch 
the apples in fulfillment of his final labor. On returning, Atlas 
refused to accept his burden back, until Herakles cheated him into 
doing so. In the metope, Herakles supports a cushion (which held 
the globe) on his shoulders, with the seemingly effortless assis¬ 
tance of a young Athena. He eyes the apples as he tries to conceive 
of a way to trick Atlas into giving them up. This is not the grim 
combat so characteristic of Archaic Greek art (see figs. 5.23 and 
5.24); the burly Herakles has assumed the thoughtful air that is 
central to the Classical spirit. The figures have all the characteris¬ 
tics of early Classical sculpture: fleshy faces (often described as 
“doughy”), an economy of pose and expression, and simple, 
solemn drapery.

5.39 Plan of Akropolis at Athens in 400 bce (after A. W. Lawrence) 



Architecture and Sculpture 
on the Athenian Akropolis 

As in many Greek cities, the principal centers of Athenian public 
life were the agora and the Akropolis. The agora (fig. 5.37) was 
primarily a marketplace, but as time passed Athenians dedicated 
temples and civic buildings such as stoas (colonnaded porticoes) 
there, and the space took on a monumental character. The 
Akropolis had been a fortified site since Mycenaean times, around 
1250 bce (figs. 5.38 and 5.39). During the Archaic period, it was 
home to at least one sizeable temple dedicated to the city’s patron 
goddess, Athena, as well as several smaller temples or treasuries, 
and votive statues. For over 30 years after the Persian sack of 480 
bce, the Athenians left the sacred monuments on the Akropolis in 
ruins, as a solemn reminder of the enemy’s ruthlessness. This 
changed in the mid-fifth century bce, with the emergence of 
Perikles into political life. Perikles’ ambitions for Athens included 
transforming the city—with its population of about 150,000— 
into the envy of the Mediterranean world. His projects, which the 
democratic assembly approved, began on the Akropolis. 
Individually and collectively, the structures there expressed the 
ideals of the Athenian city-state, and have come to exemplify 
Classical Greek art at its height. (See www.myartslab.com. ) 


THE PARTHENON The dominant temple on the Akropolis is 
the Parthenon (fig. 5.40). Perikles conceived it to play a focal role 
in the cult of Athena, though there is no evidence that Athenians 
used it directly for cult practices; there is no altar to the east, and 
the chief center of cult practice remained on the site of the 
Erechtheion, north of the Parthenon (see fig. 5.51). Built of 
gleaming white marble from nearby Mount Pentelikon, the 
Parthenon occupies a prominent site on the southern flank of the 
Akropolis. From there it dominates the city and the surrounding 
countryside, a brilliant landmark against the backdrop of moun¬ 
tains to the north, east, and west. Contemporary building records, 
and a biography of Perikles written by the Greek historian 
Plutarch, indicate that two architects named Iktinos and 
Kallikrates oversaw its construction between 447 and 432 bce. To 
meet the expense of building the largest and most lavish temple of 
its time on the Greek mainland, Perikles resorted in part to funds 
collected from the Delian League, its allies against the Persians. 
Perhaps the Persian danger no longer seemed real; still, the use of 
these funds weakened Athens’ position in relation to its allies. 
Centuries later, Plutarch still remembered accusations against 
Perikles for adorning the city “like a harlot with precious stones, 
statues, and temples costing a thousand talents. ” 


CHAPTER 5 GREEK ART 131

When read against the architectural vocabulary of Classical 
Greece, the Parthenon emerges as an extraordinarily sophisticated 
building. Its parts integrate fully with one another, so that its 
spaces do not seem to be separate, but to melt into one another. 
Likewise, architecture and sculpture are so intertwined that dis¬ 
cussion of the two cannot be disentangled. The temple stood near 
the culminating point of a grand procession that wound its way 
through the agora and onto the Akropolis during the Panathenaic 
festival in Athenas honor; as magnificent as it was to observe 
from a distance, it was also a building to experience from within. 
Imitating the grandiose temples of Archaic Ionia, the Parthenon 
featured an octastyle (eight-column) arrangement of its narrow 
ends. This was unusually wide, offering a generous embrace and 
enough space for an arrangement of a U-shaped colonnade in the 
cella and an enormous statue of Athena by the famed sculptor 
Pheidias. She stood with one hand supporting a personification of 
Victory, and a shield resting against her side. Pheidias fashioned 
the figure out of ivory and gold (a combination known as chrys¬ 
elephantine), supported on a wooden armature (fig. 5.41). It was 
extraordinarily valuable, and the building s forms drew visitors in 
to view it. Like all peripteral temples, the encircling colonnade 
gave the impression that a visitor could approach the temple from 
all sides. In fact, a prostyle porch of six columns (where the 
columns stand in front of the side walls, rather than between 


them) mediated entry to the cella at the east end, and to an 
opisthonaos (rear room), on the west, containing four tall, 
slender Ionic columns. The porches are unusually shallow. This 
allowed light into the cella, which otherwise came in through two 
large windows on either side of the cella s main entrance. In its 
combination of a well-lit interior and the rational articulation of 
the interior space with a colonnade, the Parthenon initiated a new 
interest in the embellishment of interior space. 

Compared with the Temple of Hera II at Paestum (see fig. 5.9, 
right), the Parthenon appears far less massive, despite its greater 
size. One of the reasons for this is a lightening and an adjusting 
of proportions since the Archaic period. The columns are more 
slender, their tapering and entasis less pronounced, and the 
capitals are smaller and less flaring. Practical necessity partly 
determined the diameter of the columns: For convenience and 
economy, the architects reused many drums from the earlier 
Parthenon, still unfinished at the time of the Persian sack. Yet 
how these columns would relate to the rest of the building was a 
matter for new design. Their spacing, for instance, is wider than 
in earlier buildings. The entablature is lower in relation to their 
height and to the temple s width, and the cornice (protruding 
horizontal element) projects less. The load the columns carry 
seems to have decreased, and as a result the supports appear able 
to fulfill their task with a new ease.

Aristotle (384-322) BCE 

The Politics, from Book VIII 

The Politics is a counterpart to Plato s Republic, a treatment of the 
constitution of the state. Books VII and VIII discuss the education pre¬ 
scribed for good citizens. Drawing is included as a liberal art—that is, a 
skill not only use ful hut also conducive to higher activities. Yet painting 
and sculpture are said to have only limited power to move the soul. 

T here is a sort of education in which parents should train their 
sons, not as being useful or necessary, but because it is liberal or 
noble. ... Further, it is clear that children should be instructed in some 
useful things—for example, in reading and writing—not only for 
their usefulness, but also because many other sorts of knowledge are 
acquired through them. With a like view they may be taught drawing, 
not to prevent their making mistakes in their own purchases, or in 
order that they may not be imposed upon in the buying or selling of 


articles [works of art], but perhaps rather because it makes them 
judges of the beauty of the human form. To be always seeking after 
the useful does not become free and exalted souls. ... 

The habit of feeling pleasure or pain at mere representations is not 
far removed from the same feeling about realities; for example, if any 
one delights in the sight of a statue for its beauty only, it necessarily 
follows that the sight of the original will be pleasant to him. The 
objects of no other sense, such as taste or touch, have any resem¬ 
blance to moral qualities; in visible objects there is only a little, for 
there are figures which are of a moral character, but only to a slight 
extent, and all do not participate in the feeling about them. Again, fig¬ 
ures and colors are not imitations, but signs, of character, indications 
which the body gives of states of feeling. The connexion of them with 
morals is slight, but in so far as there is any, young men should be 
taught to look ... at [the works] of Polygnotus, or any other painter 
or sculptor who expresses character.

Like Polykleitos, Iktinos and Kallikrates grappled with issues 
of commensurability. The governing principle behind their design 
was a ratio of 9:4 or 2x + l:x. Thus, for instance, the 8 (x) columns 
across the facades answer seventeen (2x +1) columns along the 
sides. Additionally, the ratio of the spacing between two columns 
(the intercolumniation) to the diameter at the lowest point of the 



column was 9:4. It was not just a matter of design convenience, 
but an attempt to produce harmony through numerical relation¬ 
ships. Libon of Elis first used this proportional scheme in the 
Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Iktinos and Kallikrates employed it 
pervasively in the Parthenon, though never dogmatically. In fact, 
despite the relative precision the formula dictated, they built 
intentional departures from the design s strict geometric regularity 
into the Parthenon (as architects did in other temples). For instance, 
the columns are not vertical, but lean in toward the cella (the cor¬ 
ner columns in two directions), and the space between the corner 
column and its neighbors is smaller than the standard intercolum¬ 
niation of the colonnade as a whole. Moreover, the stepped plat¬ 
form on which the temple rests is not fully horizontal, but bows 
upward, so that the center of the long sides is about 4 inches 
higher than the corners. This curvature reflects up through the 
temple s entablature, and every column capital is slightly distorted 
to fit the bowed architrave. That these irregularities were inten¬ 
tional is beyond doubt, as masons tailormade individual blocks to 
accommodate them. Why they were desirable is less clear. 

When architects first introduced irregularities into temple 
architecture, some 100 years earlier, they may have intended to 
solve drainage problems. Yet in the Parthenon, they are so exag¬ 
gerated that scholars consider them to be corrections of optical 
illusions. For instance, when viewed from a distance, straight hor¬ 
izontals appear to sag, but if the horizontals curve upward, they 
look straight. When seen close up, a long straight line seems to 
curve like the horizon; by exaggerating the curve, the architects 
could make the temple appear even larger than it was. These two 
apparently contradictory theories could work in tandem, since 
different optical distortions would prevail depending on a 
viewer s vantage point. What is certain is that these refinements

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



Repatriation of Cultural Heritage 


I n 2008, a new Acropolis Museum in Athens opened for preliminary 
viewing. Swiss-French architect Bernard Tschumi designed the 
museum to hold finds from the Akropolis; but it also incorporates a 
hall to house the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, a move designed 
to put pressure on the British Museum in London to send them home. 
Ever since 1 978, when UNESCO established a department entitled the 
Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural 
Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit 
Appropriation, the Elgin Marbles have stood at the center of a heated 
debate on the repatriation of antiquities: Should museums around the 
world be required to return objects of cultural value to their countries 
of origin? And should museums purchase works of art that have been 
illegally trafficked? Recently, the Italian government made headlines 
by publicly requesting the return of objects illegally looted from Italy 
and purchased (generally in good faith) by museums in the United 
States. And to celebrate the successful outcome of negotiations with 
museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the 
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Getty, it mounted a free exhibi¬ 
tion of works of art that had “come home,” in the Italian president’s 
Quirinal Palace. 

The issues might seem straightforward, but repatriation and 
museum acquisition of illegally trafficked objects are actually complex 
questions. It is understandable that a country should want to retain its 
cultural heritage. Moreover, for archaeologists, objects removed by 
looting lose much of their value (see The Art Historian’s Lens, page 
29). Yet the grand-scale return of works of art to their home countries 
would cut the heart out of many established museums with valuable 
educational functions. Should all objects be returned, or just the more 
outstanding works of art—in which case, who should make such a 


qualitative judgment? If repatriation were to apply only to recent 
acquisitions, how long must an object’s pedigree be to make it legal? 
If looting is inevitable, is it better that a museum purchase illegal 
objects and display them publicly, or that they should disappear into 
private collections? Is it better for a work of art to decay in its home 
country if conditions there prevent adequate preservation, or to be 
maintained elsewhere? And what if an individual or museum pur¬ 
chased antiquities legally from an invading force (such as the Ottoman 
authorities, who controlled Greece in Lord Elgin’s day)? Such issues are 
not easily resolved.

give the temple a dynamic quality that it might otherwise lack. 
Rather than sitting quietly on its platform, the building derives 
energy from its swelling forms as if it were about to burst out of 
its own skin; through the refinements, the temple comes alive. 

THE PARTHENON SCULPTURES The largest group of sur¬ 
viving Classical sculptures comes from the Parthenon, which had 
a more extensive decorative program than any previous temple. 
The sculptures have a vivid and often unfortunate history. 


Christians converted the temple into a church, probably in the 
sixth century ce, and much of the decoration on the east side was 
destroyed or vandalized. In 1687, Venetian cannon fire ignited 
ammunition that the Turkish forces were storing in the temple. 
The west pediment figures survived the explosion, but not the 
wars aftermath. They shattered when a crane dropped them 
while removing them so that the Venetian commander could take 
them to Venice. Over 100 years later, Lord Elgin, British ambas¬ 
sador to Constantinople, purchased what he could of the temple s

decoration from the Turks and shipped it to England. In 1816, 
needing money, he sold it to the British Museum. Today, the Elgin 
Marbles, as they are known, stand at the center of a heated debate 
on the repatriation of national treasures. (See The Art Historian's 
Lens , page 134.) 

Thirteen years before the explosion in the Parthenon, an artist 
named Jacques Carrey was traveling in Athens as part of the 
retinue of the French ambassador to the Ottoman court. He 
executed a series of drawings of surviving Parthenon sculptures, 
which, along with literary sources, have become invaluable 
resources for understanding the decorative program as a whole 
(fig. 5.42). Like the sculptures on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, 
the Parthenon sculptures had topical relevance. The west pedi¬ 
ment portrayed the struggle between Athena and Poseidon to be 
Athens’ patron deity. The east pediment represented the birth of 
Athena from the head of Zeus, in the presence of other gods. All 
but the central figures survive, and Carrey’s drawing allows for a 
confident reconstruction of their arrangement. Bursting from the 
left corner is the upper body of Helios, the sun-god, whose rear¬ 
ing horses draw him into view Balancing him in the right corner, 
Selene, the moon-goddess, or Nyx, the night, sinks away with her 
horses. These celestial gods define the day’s passing, and place the 
scene in an eternal cosmic realm. To the right of Helios, a nude 
male figure in a semireclining position is probably Dionysos. On 
the other side of the pediment, a closely knit group of three 
female deities was long identified as Hestia, Dione, and 
Aphrodite. A recent analysis of the group sees them instead as 
Leto, Artemis, and Aphrodite (fig. 5.43). 

As a group, the pediment figures are strikingly impressive. 
Like the building in which they are embedded, their forms are 
strong and solid, yet their implied power contrasts with their lan¬ 
guid poses and gains strength from the contrast. The female group 
is a masterpiece of swirling drapery, which disguises the sheer 


bulk of the marble. The garments cling to the bodies beneath as if 
wet, both concealing and revealing flesh. Yet the drapery does not 
follow the lines of the body, as it does on the Charioteer ofMotya 
(see fig. 5.30), so much as struggle with them, twisting around the 
legs in massive folds. The effect is extraordinary: Although a 
viewer can only see the deities from a frontal vantage point, as if 
the figures were two-dimensional, the curves of the deeply cut 
folds echo their forms in section (i.e., along a plane made by an 
imaginary vertical slice from front to back), and thereby broad¬ 
cast their three-dimensionality. The effect goes against nature; yet 
the sculptor, possibly Pheidias himself, could better express 
nature through the appearance of truth than through truth itself. 
This optical device is a sculptural equivalent of the deliberate 
distortions in the temple’s architecture. 

Running the whole way around the building (rather than just 
at the ends, as at Olympia) was a full program of metopes, num¬ 
bering 92 in all, depicting scenes of violent action. On the west 
side, sculptors described the battle of the Greeks against the 
Amazons (an Amazonomachy), a mythical race ruled by their 
warrior women. Metopes on the north side portrayed the Sack of 
Troy (the Ilioupersis ), the conclusion of the Trojan War, when 
Greek forces fought the Trojans over Paris’ abduction of Helen, 
wife of Menelaus, brother of King Agamemnon. On the east side, 
the gods fought the giants. The metopes of the south side mostly 
depict the Battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs, already seen at 
Olympia. The four cycles come together to form a thematic 
whole: All depict the tension between the civilized and uncivi¬ 
lized worlds, between order and chaos; and all are therefore alle¬ 
gories for the Athenian victory over the Persians. Historical 
events are cloaked again in the guise of myth; myth elevates life so 
that the triumph of order over chaos has a preordained inevitabil¬ 
ity. Little survives of the metope cycles except for those on the 
south side, which are relatively well preserved. Their quality

Plutarch (ca. 46-after 119 ce) 



Parallel Lives of Greeks and Romans, from the 
lives of Perikles and Fabius Maximus 

A Greek author of the Roman period , Plutarch wrote Parallel Lives to 
show that ancient Greece matched or exceeded Rome in its great lead¬ 
ers. Comparing Perikles (d. 429 BCE ) with Fabius Maximus (d. 203 BCE), 
he concludes that Perikles' buildings surpass all the architecture of the 
Romans. Plutarch is the only ancient source to say that Pheidias was 
the overseer of Perikles' works. 

B ut that which brought most delightful adornment to Athens, and 
the greatest amazement to the rest of mankind; that which alone 
now testifies for Hellas that her ancient power and splendour, of 
which so much is told, was no idle fiction—I mean his construction 
of sacred edifices. ... For this reason are the works of Perikles all the 
more to be wondered at; they were created in a short time for all time. 


Each one of them, in its beauty, was even then and at once antique; 
but in the freshness of its vigour it is, even to the present day, recent 
and newly wrought. Such is the bloom of perpetual newness, as it 
were, upon these works of his, which makes them ever to look 
untouched by time, as though the unfaltering breath of an ageless 
spirit had been infused into them. 

His general manager and general overseer was Pheidias, although 
the several works had great architects and artists besides. Of the 
Parthenon, for instance, with its cella of a hundred feet in length, 
Kallicrates and Iktinus were the architects. ... 

By the side of the great public works, the temples, and the stately 
edifices, with which Perikles adorned Athens, all Romes attempts at 
splendour down to the times of the Caesars, taken together, are not 
worthy to be considered, nay, the one had a towering preeminence 
above the other, both in grandeur of design, and grandeur of execu¬ 
tion, which precludes comparison.

Press, 1 91 6) 


varies dramatically: Not all of them are as successful as the ballet¬ 
like choreography of figure 5.44, which reminds us that a vast 
crew of workers must have been engaged in completing the 
Parthenon in such a short period: They executed two pediments 
and the frieze in under ten years (ca. 440-432 bce).

The Parthenon is often viewed as the perfect embodiment of 
the Classical Doric style. Although this may be the impression 
from the outside, it is far from accurate. At architrave level within 
the peristyle, a continuous sculpted frieze runs around all sides of 
the building, in a variation of the Ionic style (see fig. 5.8). In a con¬ 
tinuous sculpted band, some 525 feet long (fig. 5.45), the frieze 
depicts a procession, moving from west to east, propelling the 
viewer around the temple, drawn close to the building to read the 
images. Horsemen jostle with musicians, water-carriers, and sac¬ 
rificial beasts. Figures overlap to create the illusion of a crowd, 
even though the relief is only inches deep. Frenzied animals 
underline the calm demeanor of the human figures (see The Art 
Historian's Lens , page 134), who have the ideal proportions of the 
Doryphoros. 

According to the traditional view, the procession depicted in 
the frieze is the Panathenaic procession, part of a festival held 
annually to honor Athena in the presence of the other Olympian 
gods, and on a grander scale every four years. The figures and 
their groupings are typical of the participants in these processions, 
and the frieze represents an idealized event, rather than a specific 
moment. If this view is correct, the frieze is remarkable in that for 
the first time it exalts mortal Greeks by depicting them in a space 
usually reserved for divine and mythological scenes. The most 
problematic aspect of the relief is the detail in figure 5.46, from the 
center of the east end of the temple, where there are five uniden¬ 
tified figures, three of them young. Two of the young figures 
carry stools on their heads, while the third, in a group with one of 
the adults, handles a piece of cloth. According to the traditional 
view, the cloth is a new robe for Athena, woven by Athenian girls 
and women and depicting Athenas triumph against the giants in 
the gigantomachy. An alternative and controversial theory, how¬ 
ever, places the entire frieze in the realm of myth, interpreting this 
scene as the three daughters of Erechtheus, a legendary king of 
Athens. According to Athenian myth, the oracle at Delphi

demanded the death of one of Erechtheus’ daughters if Athens 
was to be saved from its enemies. Here, one of the daughters 
calmly receives the garment in which she will be sacrificed. The 
myth had obvious resonance for Athens after its victory over 
the Persians, and the playwright Euripides made it the subject of 
a tragedy. 

Whatever the meaning of the frieze, its iconography integrated 
Athenians and divine space, time, and ritual practice in a unity 


that reflected the Athenians’ sense of superiority and self-confi¬ 
dence. The problem of the frieze is exacerbated by the discovery, 
during the buildings recent preservation and reconstruction, 
that the pronaos featured another frieze in its upper well. 
Nothing survives of this frieze, but if it was thematically con¬ 
nected with the frieze around the cella, we lack a crucial piece of 
evidence for a secure identification and interpretation of the 
iconography.

THE PH El Dl AN STYLE According to Plutarch, the sculptor 
Pheidias was chief overseer of all the artistic projects that Perikles 
sponsored. (See Primary Source , page 136.) Ancient literary 
sources attribute few works directly to his hand: His huge sculp¬ 
ture of Athena Parthenos, and a second chryselephantine colossus 
of a seated Zeus in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, aroused 
extreme admiration, not only due to their religious roles, but also 
because of their vast size and the sheer value of the materials 
employed. An equally large bronze sculpture of Athena that 
stood on the Akropolis facing the Propylaia was also by the mas¬ 
ter sculptor. None of these works survives, and small-scale copies 
made in later times convey little of their original majesty. He may 
have worked personally on the Parthenon’s architectural sculp¬ 
ture, which undoubtedly involved a large number of masters, but 
equally he may have simply been a very able supervisor. We can 
therefore know little for certain about his artistic style. 
Nevertheless, Pheidias has come to be associated with the 
Parthenon style, which is often synonymous with the “Pheidian 


style.” The term conveys an ideal that was not merely artistic 
but also philosophical: The idealized faces and proportions of 
the Athenians elevate them above the uncivilized world in 
which they operate. They share the calmness of the gods, who 
are aware of, yet aloof from, human affairs as they fulfill their 
cosmic roles. 

Given the prominence of the Parthenon, it is hardly surprising 
that the Pheidian style should have dominated Athenian sculpture 
until the end of the fifth century bce and beyond, even though 
large-scale sculptural enterprises gradually dwindled with the 
onset of the Peloponnesian War. The style is clear in one of the 
last of these projects, a balustrade built around the small Temple 
of Athena Nike on the Akropolis in about 410-407 bce (see fig. 
5.50). Like the Parthenon frieze, it shows a festive procession, but 
the participants are not Athenians but winged personifications of 
Victory (Nike, plural Nikai). One Nike is taking off her sandals,

indicating that she is about to step on holy ground (fig. 5.47). Her 
wings keep her stable, so that she performs this normally awk¬ 
ward act with elegance and ease. The Pheidian style is most 
evident in the deeply cut folds of her “wet look” garments, which 
cling to her body and fall in deep swags between her legs. 

On the Grave Stele of Hegeso (fig. 5.48), also from the last 
years of the fifth century bce, the Pheidian style is again recogniz¬ 
able in the drapery, but also in the smooth planes of the idealized 
faces, and the quiet mood of the scene. The artist represented the 
deceased woman seated on an elegant chair, in a simple domestic 
scene that became standard for funerary markers for young 
women, whose realm was almost exclusively within the home. 
She has picked a piece of jewelry from a box held by a girl servant 
and seems to contemplate it. The delicacy of the carving is espe¬ 
cially clear in the forms farthest away from a viewer, such as the 
servants left arm, or the veil behind Hegeso s right shoulder. 
Here, the relief merges with the background, strengthening the 
illusion that the background is empty space rather than a solid 
surface. This stele is a fine example of a type of memorial that 
Athenian sculptors produced in large numbers from about 425 
bce onward, perhaps following a relaxation of earlier sumptuary 
laws that had curbed expenditure on funerary commemoration. 
Their export must have helped to spread the Pheidian style 
throughout the Greek world. 


THE PROPYLAlA In the year of the Parthenon’s dedication, 
437 bce, Perikles commissioned another costly project: the mon¬ 
umental gate at the western end of the Akropolis, called the 
Propylaia (see fig. 5.38). Mnesikles was the architect in charge, 
and he completed the main section in five years; the remainder 
was abandoned with the onset of the Peloponnesian War in 431 
bce. He designed the entire structure in marble, and incorporated 
refinements similar to those in the Parthenon. In fact, Mnesikles 
cleverly adapted elements of traditional temple design to a totally 
different task, and to a site that rose steeply and irregularly. 
Conceived on two levels, the design transforms a rough passage 
among rocks into a magnificent entrance to the sacred precinct. 
Only the eastern porch (or facade) is in fair condition today. It 
resembles a Classical Doric temple facade, except for the wide 
opening between the third and fourth columns, which allowed 
traffic to pass onto the Akropolis; this feature is common in 
Ionian architecture. Placed along this central passageway through 
the Propylaia were two rows of slender Ionic columns, echoing 
the Ionic columns in the Parthenon. Flanking the western porch 
(fig. 5.49) were two wings, of unequal size because of constraints 
imposed by the terrain (figs. 5.38 and 5.39). The larger one to the 
north contained a picture gallery (pinakotheke), the first known 
instance of a public room specially designed for the display of 
paintings. The southern wing may have held a library.

Akropolis, Athens 

THE TEMPLE OF ATHENA NIKE The architects who designed 
the Parthenon and the Propylaia incorporated Ionic elements into 
essentially Doric buildings for a reason that may have had as 
much to do with politics as with design. In pre-Classical times, 
the only Ionic structures on the Greek mainland were small treas¬ 
uries, like the Siphnian Treasury (fig. 5.20), which eastern Greek 
states erected at Delphi in their regional styles. When Athenian 
architects used the Ionic style, Perikles may have been making a 
deliberate symbolic gesture, uniting the disparate regions of 
Greece in an international style. The Akropolis, in fact, houses the 
finest surviving examples of Ionic architecture. One is the small 
Temple of Athena Nike, to the south of the Propylaia (fig. 5.50). 
Kallikrates may have designed it 20 years earlier to celebrate the 
Athenian victory over the Persians, but building probably only 
occurred between 427 and 424 bce. The decorative quality of the 
Ionic style, with finer proportions than those found in the Doric 
style, made it a natural choice for the jewel-like building. Standing 
on a projecting bastion, it was the first structure to greet a visitor 
to the Akropolis. 

THE ERECHTHEION A second, larger Ionic temple stood 
alongside the Parthenon. The Erechtheion was built between 421 
and 405 bce, and was probably another of Mnesikles’ projects 


(fig. 5.51 and plan in fig. 5.39). As with the Propylaia, the 
architect had to deal with difficult terrain: Not only did the site 
slope, but it already accommodated various shrines associated 
with the mythical founding of Athens that could not be moved. 
Beneath it, for instance, was the spot where, so Athenians 
believed, Poseidon and Athena competed for custody of Athens. 
In addition to the olive tree that Athena gave the city in the con¬ 
test, the temple enclosed a saltwater pool that supposedly sprang 
up where Poseidon threw his trident. The architect therefore 
designed the Erechtheion to serve several religious functions 
simultaneously. Its highly irregular plan included four rooms, as 
well as a basement on the western side. The main, eastern room 
was dedicated to Athena Polias (Athena as the City Goddess) and 
contained the old cult image, an amorphous piece of olive wood 
that was the most sacred cult object in Athens; the western room 
was sacred to Poseidon. Another room held a cult of King 
Erechtheus, who promoted the worship of Athena and for whom 
the building is named. 

Instead of a west facade, the Erechtheion has two porches 
attached to its flanks. A very large one dedicated to Poseidon 
faces north and served as the main entrance, while a smaller one 
juts out toward the Parthenon. The latter is the famous Porch of 
the Maidens (see fig. 5.51), so named because six caryatids, instead

of columns, support its roof on a high parapet. The Roman archi¬ 
tect Vitruvius wrote that these figural columns represented the 
women of Caryae, a city-state in the Peloponnese that formed an 
alliance with the Persians in the Persian Wars. When the war was 
over, the triumphant Greeks killed the men of Caryae, and took 
the women as slaves, forcing them nonetheless to retain their fine 
clothing and other marks of their former status as visible 
reminders of their shame. Thus, Vitruvius continues, architects 
designed images of these women to bear the burden of their state s 
dishonor in perpetuity. Vitruvius 5 explanation for the origin of 
caryatids is inconsistent with the fact that they appear on the 
Siphnian Treasury well before the Persian Wars (see fig. 5.20); but 
it may reveal the special significance of caryatids for Athenians 
after the war. Even beyond the caryatids, the Erechtheion was a 
highly decorative temple. Its pediments remained bare, perhaps 
for lack of funds at the end of the Peloponnesian War, and little 
survives of the sculptural frieze. However, the carving on the 
bases and capitals of the columns, and on the frames of doorways 
and windows, is extraordinarily delicate and rich. Indeed, accord¬ 
ing to stone inscriptions detailing construction expenses for the 
building, it cost more than the temple s figural sculpture. 

Although the Akropolis buildings arose over the course of 
several decades, Perikles clearly intended them as a programmatic 
unit. The solid, stately forms of the Doric Parthenon and Propylaia 
complemented the lighter, more decorative style of the Temple of 
Athena Nike and Erechtheion, and together they honored 
Athens 5 protective goddess, and expressed the ideals and grandeur 
of the city-state and its place in the wider Greek world. 

THE LATE CLASSICAL PERIOD 

By the end of the fifth century bce, Athens 5 supremacy was on 
the wane. Conflict between Athens and the Peloponnesian cities 
of Corinth and Sparta, which had been smoldering since about 
460 bce, gradually escalated into the great Peloponnesian War in 
431. By the time this ended in 404, Athens had lost. During the 
following century, the Greek city-states were constantly at odds 
with one another. In 338 bce, Philip II, who had acceded to power 
in the kingdom of Macedon, to the north, exploited their disunity 
by invading Greece, and decisively defeated the Athenians and 
Thebans at the Battle of Chaironeia. The change in Greece’s for¬ 
tune finds its reflection in the art and architecture of the time, as 
artists and architects start to move away from traditional forms 
and subjects. 

Late Classical Architecture: Civic and Sacred 

Two notable changes occurred in monumental architecture in the 
late fifth and fourth centuries bce. One was a shift in emphasis: As 

5.5 2 Reconstruction drawing of the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos. 
ca. 359-351 bce (from H. Colvin) 


well as constructing temples, architects explored a range of other 
building types. Many of these—stoas, meeting houses for the 
governing council, and the like—had long existed, but now took 
on grander form. The other was the development of a new style: 
the Corinthian. 

THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALIKARNASSOS In Halikarnassos 
(present-day Bodrum, in southwest Turkey; see map 5.1), the ten¬ 
dency toward monumentalization resulted in a vast tomb for 
Mausolos, who ruled Caria from 377 to 353 bce as satrap for the 
Persians. His wife and sister, Artemisia, commissioned Pytheos of 
Priene to design the sepulcher to commemorate Mausolos as 
hero-founder of Halikarnassos. Such was its renown in antiquity 
that the ancients counted it among the seven wonders of the 
ancient world and by Roman imperial times its title, the 
Mausoleum, was used to describe any monumental tomb. It 
stood reasonably intact until the thirteenth century ce, when an 
earthquake brought down the upper sections. Then, in the late 
fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the Knights of St. John 
used the site as a source of squared stone to refortify their castle. 
In 1857, the British archaeologist Charles Newton removed many 
sculptural fragments to the British Museum. Danish excavations 
continue to yield information at the site. When coupled with 
literary evidence, archaeological data permits reconstructions, 
though none has met with universal approval (see 
www.myartslab.com) . One hypothesis appears in figure 5.52.

The Mausoleum combined the monumental tomb-building

ture, and an Egyptian pyramid. The grouping of these elements in 
a single monument is evidence of a growing diversity in architec¬ 
ture. It may also have had a propagandistic function: It may have 
expressed Carian supremacy in the region and the symbiosis of 
Greek and non-Greek civilizations that might be achieved 
through founding a Carian empire headed by Halikarnassos. 


CORINTHIAN CAPITAL The other major change in architec¬ 
ture that took place in the late fifth century bce was the 
development of the Corinthian capital (fig. 5.53) as an elaborate 
substitute for the Ionic. Its shape is an inverted bell covered with 
the curly shoots and leaves of an acanthus plant, which seem to 
sprout from the top of the column shaft. Writing about four 
centuries later in Italy, Vitruvius ascribed its invention to the 
metalworker Kallimachos. At first, Greek builders only used 
Corinthian capitals in temple interiors, perhaps because of the 
conservative nature of Greek architecture, or because of the per¬ 
ceived sanctity of its vegetal forms. It was not until the second 
century bce that Corinthian columns appeared on the exteriors of 
buildings. The capital in figure 5.54 belongs to a circular shrine, or 
tholos at Epidauros designed by Polykleitos the Younger. The cir¬ 
cular form of the shrine is further evidence of the preoccupation 
with new types of building, and its elaborate interior continues 
the tradition, begun with the Parthenon, of stressing the articula¬ 
tion of interior space. 

Late Classical Sculpture 

The Pheidian style, with its apparent confidence in the transcen¬ 
dence of the Athenian city-state, did not survive Athens’ 
devastating defeat in the Peloponnesian War. At the end of the 
fifth century, a shift in mood is perceptible in sculpture, which 
seems to reflect a different—and less optimistic—view of man’s 
place in the universe. 

Scholars attempt to match surviving sculptures with fourth- 
century bce sculptors named in literary sources. Among these is 
Skopas of Paros. According to the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, 
he was one of four masters chosen to work on the Mausoleum of 
Halikarnassos, and art historians recognize his dynamic style in 
some parts of a frieze from the tomb depicting the battle of the 
Greeks and the Amazons. His greatest fame, though, derives from

the way he infused emotion into the faces he sculpted. A 
fragmentary head from a pediment of the Temple of Athena Alea 
at Tegea of about 340 bce is either by Skopas, or an artist deeply 
influenced by his work (fig. 5.55). A lion skin covering the head 
identifies it as either Herakles or his son Telephos. The smooth 
planes and fleshy treatment of the face are characteristic of 
Classical art, as seen on the Parthenon. What is new, however, is 
how the sculptor cut the marble away sharply over the eyes toward 
the bridge of the nose to create a dark shadow At the outer edge, 
the eyelid bulges to overhang the eye. This simple change charges 
the face with a depth of emotion not seen before. The slightly 
parted lips and the sharp turn of the head enhance the effect. 

PRAXI TELES If the Greeks were less confident of their place in 
the world in the Late Classical period, they were also less certain 
of their relationship to fate and the gods. This is reflected in the 
work of Praxiteles, who was at work at roughly the same time as 
Skopas. Choosing to work in marble rather than bronze, he exe¬ 
cuted several statues of divinities. Where fifth-century bce artists 
had stressed the gods’ majesty, Praxiteles gave them a youthful 
sensuousness that suggests their willful capriciousness toward 
humans. His most famous work is a sculpture of Aphrodite, 
dating to about 340-330 bce (fig. 5.56). Pliny records that the 
people of Kos commissioned a cult statue of Aphrodite from

Praxiteles, but rejected the nude statue he offered them in favor of 
a draped version. But the inhabitants of Knidos purchased the 
nude statue, and profited from the risk: Her fame spread fast, and 
visitors came to the island from far and wide to see her. (See 
www.myartslab.com. ) Perhaps it was her nudity that drew so 
much attention: She was the first nude monumental statue of a

goddess in the Greek world. Yet even if artists had previously 
reserved female nudity principally for representations of slaves or 
courtesans, the clinging drapery of the fifth century bce had 
exposed almost as much of the female anatomy as it concealed. 
Her appeal may have resided just as much in the blatant eroticism 
of the image. A viewer catches Aphrodite either as she is about 
to bathe or as she is rising from her bath. With her right hand, 
she covers her nudity in a gesture of modesty, while grasping 
for a robe with her left. Her head is slightly turned, so she 
does not engage a viewer’s gaze directly, but a viewer is made 
complicit with the sculpture, willingly or not, by having 
inappropriately witnessed her in her nudity. Perhaps, in her capri¬ 
ciousness, Aphrodite intended to be surprised as she bathed; the 
uncertainty for a viewer augments the erotic quality of the image. 
By some accounts, the Knidians displayed Praxiteles’ sculpture in 
a circular shrine with entrances at front and back, so visitors could 
view the cult statue from all sides. A viewer’s role is more com¬ 
plex here than in the Classical period: The sculpture invites 
physical and emotional engagement, not merely respect. 

Praxiteles’ Aphrodite is known to us only through Roman 
copies. In this respect, a group representing Hermes holding the 
infant Dionysos poses complicated questions (fig. 5.57). The 
Roman writer Pausanias mentions seeing such a statue by 
Praxiteles in the Temple of Hera at Olympia, where this marble 
was found in 1877. It is of such high quality that art historians 
have long regarded it as a late work by Praxiteles himself. Now, 
however, most scholars believe it to be a fine copy of the first 
century bce because of the strut support and unfinished back; 
analysis of the tool marks on the surface of the marble support 
this date, as do the sandals, which are distinctly Roman in style. 
Still, the group has all the characteristics of Praxitelean sculpture. 
Hermes is more slender in proportion than Polykleitos’ 
Doryphoros (see fig. 5.33), and the chiastic pose is so exaggerated 
as to have become a fully relaxed and languid curve of the torso. 
The anatomy, so clearly defined on the Doryphoros , blurs to sug¬ 
gest a youthful sensuousness rather than athletic prowess. The 
surface treatment of the marble is masterful, contrasting highly 
polished skin with rough, almost expressionistic hair. The group 
has a humorous quality typical of Praxiteles’ work as well: The 
messenger god originally dangled a bunch of grapes in front of 
Dionysos, whose attempts to reach for them foreshadow his 
eventual role as the god of wine. Yet, depending upon a viewer’s 
mood (or worldview), Hermes’ distant gaze may also hold a 
callous disregard for the child’s efforts. 


LYSIPPOS A third great name in fourth-century bce sculpture 
is Lysippos, who had an extremely long career. He may have begun 
sculpting as early as about 370 bce and continued almost to the 
end of the century. Known from Roman copies, his Apoxyomenos 
(a youth scraping oil from his skin with a strigil) dates to about 
330 bce (fig. 5.58) and is in dialogue with Polykleitos’ Doryphoros 
(see fig. 5.33). Lysippos preferred more slender proportions for 
his athlete, calculating the length of the head as one-eighth of the 
body’s length, rather than one-seventh as Polykleitos had. (See 


144 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 








www artslab.com. ) The Apoxyomenos leans further back into 
his chiastic pose, too—a sign of Praxiteles’ influence—and the 
diagonal line of the free leg suggests freedom of movement. Most 
innovative, however, is the positioning of the athlete s arms. The 
outstretched arm reaches forward into a viewer s space. Since a 
frontal view foreshortens the arm, it entices a viewer to move 
around the sculpture to understand the full range of the action; 


like Praxiteles, Lysippos breaks the primacy of the frontal view 
for a standing figure. The athlete s left arm bends around to meet 
the right at chest height, so the sculpture deliberately contains 
space within its composition. Lysippos challenges the stark oppo¬ 
sition between sculpture and its environment; the two begin to 
merge. This device is symptomatic of a new interest in illusionism 
in the Late Classical and Hellenistic ages.

Painting in the Late Classical Age 

Written sources name some of the famous painters of the Classical 
age, and reveal a good deal about how painting evolved, but they 
rarely include details of what it actually looked like. The great age 
of Greek painting began early in the Classical period with 
Polygnotos of Thasos and his collaborator, Mikon of Athens, 
who both worked as sculptors as well. Polygnotos was known for 
paintings depicting the aftermath of the Trojan War in Delphi, and 
mythological paintings coupled with a depiction of the Battle of 
Marathon decorating the Stoa Poikile (Painted Stoa) in the 
Athenian agora (see fig. 5.37). He introduced several innovations 
in painting, including the depiction of emotion and character, 
which became as central to Classical painting as they were to 
sculpture. He was also first to depict women in transparent drap¬ 
ery, and to forgo the notion of a single ground-line, placing 
figures instead at varying levels in a landscape setting. 

The placement of figures at different levels of terrain seems to 
have influenced a contemporary vase painter, known today as the 
Niobid Painter. His name vase (the vase for which scholars name 
him) is a calyx krater (a wine-mixing bowl), which shows the 
outcome of Niobe s foolish boast that she had more—and more 
beautiful—children than Leto, mother of Apollo and Artemis: 
The sibling gods of hunting shoot down Niobe s sons and daugh¬ 
ters (fig. 5.59). Each of the figures has his or her own ground-line, 
which undulates to suggest a rocky landscape. Artemis and 
Apollo stand above two of their victims, who are sprawled over 
boulders, but we should probably understand the terrain to 
recede into the distance.

Significant technical differences separated wall painting from 
red-figured vase painting. Much closer to wall painting was a 
technique reserved almost exclusively for the vases Greeks 
deposited with burials: white-ground vase painting. Artists 
working in this technique painted a range of colors onto a white 
slip background, and favored a type of oil flask used in funerary 
rituals, known as a lekythos. On a lekythos from the last quarter 
of the fifth century bce, attributed to the Reed Painter (fig. 5.60),

a disconsolate young man sits on the steps of a tomb. A woman 
on the right holds his helmet, while a second man stands to the left 
with one arm raised in a gesture of farewell. Black outlines define 
the scene, filled with washes of vivid color. Some blue still sur¬ 
vives on parts of the tomb and the seated mans cloak, and brown 
in the figures’ hair, but most of the colors have long vanished, 
since fugitive paints sufficed for a vessel that did not have to 
withstand prolonged or repeated use. The freedom of the tech¬ 
nique allowed the painter to explore foreshortening and depth, 
and to achieve a remarkably expressionistic effect with a few fluid 
lines. The deceased mans deep-set brooding eyes give some indi¬ 
cation of the emotion painters could capture. Despite the artistic 
advantages of the white-ground technique, from the mid-fifth 
century bce on monumental painting gradually eclipsed vase 
painting, though in some cases vase painters tried to reproduce 
large-scale compositions. 

THE AGE OF ALEXANDER 
AND THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD 

In 336 bce, Philip II of Macedon died, and his kingdom passed 
to his son Alexander. Alexander the Great is one of the romantic 
figures of history, renowned for his military genius and personal 


charm. He embarked upon a great campaign of conquest, over¬ 
coming Egypt and the Persians, then continuing on to 
Mesopotamia and present-day Afghanistan. In 323 bce, having 
founded over 70 cities, he died at the age of 33. His conquests 
changed the face of the Greek world dramatically, expanding it 
into unknown spheres, creating new political alignments, and 
breaking down cultural boundaries (see map 5.2). 

The years following Alexanders death were fraught with 
struggles between members of his family and his generals, as each 
tried to establish himself as his sole successor; none succeeded. By 
about 275 bce, Alexander s lands had coalesced into three main 
kingdoms, which would dominate the Mediterranean until the 
Romans gradually assumed control. Ptolemy founded a dynasty 
in Egypt that reigned until Octavian (later the Roman emperor 
Augustus) defeated Cleopatra VII in 31 bce. In the east, the 
Seleucid family captured Babylon in 312 bce. From Syria they 
ruled a kingdom which, at its largest, extended from present-day 
western Turkey to Afghanistan. They lost control of a small 
pocket of territory around Pergamon to the Attalids, who 
bequeathed their city to the Romans in 133 bce. In 64 bce, the 
Seleucid kingdom came under Roman control. Most coveted was 
Alexander s ancestral Macedon, which the Antigonids controlled 
until the Roman conquest in 168 bce. Within these kingdoms, 
powerful cities grew—among them, Alexandria, Antioch, and

Pergamon—with teeming populations drawn from all over the 
new Greek world. They vied for cultural preeminence, and art 
played a large part in the rivalry. Scholars call the period from 
the death of Alexander until Roman rule the Hellenistic period, 
and Hellenistic culture was radically different from that of 
Classical times. The expansion of Greek dominance meant that 
Greek cultural institutions prevailed over a vast territory; those 
institutions commingled with the strong cultural traditions of the 
indigenous peoples. The result was a rich and diverse society, in 
which an individual s identity was more complex than before: 
the kings of Pergamon, for instance, were not Greek but strove 
for Greekness and identified themselves as Greek. All the same, 
over a wide region, people were united by a common cultural 
vocabulary, known as a koine (Greek for "common thing”). The 
art of the time reflects this richness: diverse styles coexisted, and 
artists drew inspiration from indigenous forms as well as the 
Greek heritage. 

Architecture: The Scholarly Tradition 
and Theatricality 

Within the cultural centers of the Hellenistic world, academies 
emerged, which fostered avid debate among scholars in a range of 
fields. They engaged, among other things, in a close analysis of the 
arts, and developed canons by which they could judge works of 
literature, art, and architecture. In architecture, this led, pre¬ 
dictably, to a heightened interest in systems of proportions, 
recorded in architectural treatises by practitioners of the day. 
Vitruvius asserts that the leading protagonist in this movement 
was Pytheos of Priene, one of the architects of the Mausoleum at 
Halikarnassos (see fig. 5.52). Like most, his treatise does not sur¬ 
vive, but Vitruvius notes that he was dismissive of the Doric style 
because problems with the spacing of corner triglyphs made it 
impossible to impose the style without compromise. Pytheos 
worked instead in the Ionic style (in which the volutes of corner 
capitals could be angled), as seen in his temple to Athena at 
Priene, dedicated in 334 bce (fig. 5.61). 



5.61 Plan of Pytheos. Temple of Athena, Priene. 334 bce 


The temples colonnade had 6 columns by 11, and a grid of 
squares, each 6 by 6 Attic feet (the Attic foot is slightly longer than 
the English foot), that dictated the proportions of all of its ele¬ 
ments. Proportions controlled the elevation as well: For instance, 
the columns were 43 feet high and the entablature was 7 feet high 
—a total of 50 feet, half the external length of the cella. Unlike the 
Parthenon and other Classical temples, there were no deviations 
from the rule, and no refinements. The temple is a work of the 
intellect, the product of a didactic tradition, rather than a compro¬ 
mise between theory and practice. In fact, Vitruvius faults Pytheos 
precisely for his inability to differentiate between the two. 

While this scholarly tradition flourished, the relaxation of 
architectural guidelines and the combination of architectural 
types that had occurred in the Late Classical period heralded 
another development. This was a penchant for dramatic siting, 
impressive vistas, and surprise revelations. Scholars have termed 
this movement "theatricality,” and it balanced and complemented 
the scholarly tradition. As the glory of Athens declined, the 
Athenians and other Greeks came to think of themselves less as 
members of a city-state and more as individuals; architecture, in 
turn, began to cater more and more to personal experience, often 
manipulating visitors toward a meaningful revelation. 

THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO, DIDYMA Begun in about 300 
bce and still unfinished by the end of the Roman period, the 
Temple of Apollo at Didyma is a good example of architectural 
theatricality (figs. 5.62 and 5.63). Its ground plan and design 
appear to have been established by the renowned architects 
Paionios of Ephesos and Daphnis of Miletos, on the site and at the 
scale of an Archaic temple destroyed by the Persians in 494 bce. 

From the outside, the temple appeared similar to other large- 
scale dipteral Ionic buildings of the area. A visitor would natu¬ 
rally expect the interior to repeat the format of canonical Greek 
temples such as the Parthenon; but, in fact, the architects 
constantly defied these expectations, leading visitors instead to 
dramatic vistas, perhaps intending to heighten their religious 
experience. Although the temple appeared to be accessible from 
all sides, its seven massive steps were on a divine, not a mortal 
scale, and far too high to climb comfortably. Instead, visitors 
climbed a set of shallower steps at the front, and entered the porch 
between its vast columns, set to mimic the grove of sacred trees 
around the building. As expected, an opening led to the cella—but 
this cella stood approximately 5 feet off the ground, so access was 
impossible. From this raised threshold, scholars believe, the orac¬ 
ular priestess may have uttered her prophecies to those standing 
below in the porch. The path further into the building led to the 
right or left of the threshold, where dark barrel-vaulted tunnels 
led downward. For a Greek visitor, a barrel-vaulted tunnel 
evoked a dark interior such as a cave. Yet these passages did not 
lead to a covered cella, but a vast open courtyard drenched with 
bright sunshine: A revelation, it must have seemed. 

At the end of the courtyard was the shrine itself, a small Ionic 
building dedicated to Apollo. Near the shrine were sacred laurel 
bushes and a spring of holy water. Turning back from the shrine,

a visitor faced another astonishing sight: A wide, steep staircase 
dwarfed the tunnels through which he or she had entered the 
courtyard, and led up to a pair of towering engaged Corinthian 
columns (joined to the wall). These may have signaled that the 
room that lay beyond them was the priestess’ innermost sanctu¬ 
ary We know little of the goings-on inside Greek temples, yet 


the processional quality of this staircase and the large scale of 
the courtyard suggest that large crowds of worshipers could 
have gathered there to witness ritual ceremonies. Also unknown 
is the function of small staircases leading off from the sanctuary 
and up to the roof over the colonnades. Building inscriptions 
describe them as “labyrinths,” and the ceiling above them is

carved with a brightly painted meander pattern (see fig. 5.3), the 
Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for a maze. They may have provided 
maintenance workers with access to the roof, but they may 
equally have accommodated revelatory dramas in honor of Apollo. 

As a whole, the temple s design manipulated visitors along 
unexpected paths, and offered constant surprises. Yet the temple 
is remarkable for another reason besides. Inside the courtyard, 
archaeologists unexpectedly discovered diagrams incised (so 
lightly that they are visible only under a strong raking light) upon 
its walls. These etchings are scale drawings for aspects of the 
building s design, ranging from capital decoration to column enta¬ 
sis. They provide a rare insight into the design process in Greek 
building. They suggest that architects drew a building s design 
onto its surfaces as it rose, and workers then polished them off as 
they finished those surfaces. This temple’s incompletion 
preserved the design drawings in place. 

City Planning 

Early Greek cities such as Athens grew organically, transforming 
gradually from small settlements into larger urban developments. 


Streets were typically winding, and building blocks were irregu¬ 
lar. From the seventh century bce onward, colonization offered 
Greeks an opportunity to conceive cities as a whole, and to assess 
different types of city planning, while from the Late Classical 
period, philosophers debated the structure of ideal cities. 
Hippodamos of Miletos was the first to write a treatise on city 
design, advocating grid planning—that is, laying out city streets in 
intersecting horizontals and verticals. In the mid-fifth century 
bce, he designed the Piraeus, near Athens, as a grid, and the pat¬ 
tern is still used in many Western cities today. The design offered 
many advantages: For an architect, it provided regularity; for 
colonists, it simplified the distribution of allotments; and for 
inhabitants, it meant a new ease of orientation. When the inhabi¬ 
tants of Priene relocated their city to avoid flooding, in approxi¬ 
mately 350 bce, they opted for the efficiency of a grid plan (fig. 
5.64). As the model demonstrates, the city planners applied the 
grid to the sloping terrain uncompromisingly. On some longitu¬ 
dinal axes, they inserted staircases to climb straight, steep inclines. 
Useful for pedestrians, the stairs must have been impassable by 
wheeled vehicles. Though perhaps a misjudgment, this may 
equally have been a form of traffic control.

THE ANCIENT WORLD 





PERGAMON: a THEATRICAL PLAN A visitor to the city of 
Pergamon would have had a dramatically different experience. 
There, in the early second century bce, King Eumenes II and his 
architects eschewed a grid as they planned an expansion of the 
city (fig. 5.65). Residential areas lay mainly on the plain of the 
Kaikos River; nearby was the towering Akropolis. The new 
design exploited the dramatic rise in terrain from one to the 
other, apparently assigning symbolic meaning to the ascent as 
well. On the lower levels were amenities of everyday life, such 
as the agora. As the road climbed the southern slope of the 
Akropolis, it passed through vaulted entrance tunnels to emerge 
at three gymnasia (schools); the first was for boys, the second 
for ephebes (adolescents aged 15-17), and the third and highest 
for young men. Farther up the road were sanctuaries to Hera 
and Demeter. 

The road followed the terrain, snaking past an earlier agora, 
now chiefly used for legal and political purposes, to the Akropolis 
proper, where Eumenes II, or perhaps his successor Attalos II, 
dedicated a magnificent altar court to Zeus (see fig. 5.72). Further 
up and to the east was a shrine for the hero cult, a heroon. A long 
portico temporarily obscured any view of the journeys great 
crescendo; passing through it, a visitor entered the sanctuary of 
Athena, patron goddess of Pergamon, where the city’s oldest 
temple stood, alongside Eumenes’ celebrated library, with an 
over-life-size marble version of Pheidias’ Athena Parthenos (see 
fig. 5.41). This sanctuary marked the privileged place of learning 
in Pergamene culture. On its own, the temple was not remarkable. 
Yet it acquired meaning from the symbolic journey required 
to reach it. From the sanctuary, a visitor could look out over 
the steep cavea (or seating area) of the Theater of Dionysos 
across the plain’s breathtaking panorama. Beyond the sanctuary, 
to the northeast, were the royal residence and barracks for the 
guard. Like the sanctuary, the residence offered magnificent 
views of the river and the receding countryside, and cool breezes 
blowing through the valley and up to the Akropolis must have 
provided relief from the fierce summer heat. At every turn, 
the city’s designer considered a visitor’s experience. The impres¬ 
sive vistas and sudden surprises are hallmarks of Hellenistic 
theatricality. 

THE THEATER AT EPIDAUROS Within these cities, archi¬ 
tects continued the Late Classical trend toward formalizing a 
variety of types of architecture. Given the propensity for theatri¬ 
cality, it is no surprise that they paid close attention to theater 
buildings. Theaters had long been part of the religious landscape 
of Greek cities, since Greeks gathered in their communities for 
the choral performances and plays that were central to festivals of 
Dionysos. The basic prerequisites for a theater were a hillside, on 
which an audience could sit (the cavea), and a level area for the 
performance (the orchestra). In the Late Classical and Hellenistic 
periods, however, theaters became more formalized as their essen¬ 
tial components took on architectural form. 

In the sanctuary of the healing god Asklepios at Epidauros on 
the Peloponnese, a magnificent stone theater was constructed in

the early third century bce; its upper tier was completed in the 
second century bce (figs. 5.66 and 5.67). Row upon row of stone 
seats lined the sloping hillside, covering slightly more than a semi¬ 
circle. To facilitate the audiences circulation, the architect 
grouped the seats in wedgelike sections (cunei), separated by 
staircases; a wide horizontal corridor divides the upper and lower 
sections. Actors performed in the level circle at the center, with a 
stage building (skene) behind as a backdrop, containing utility 
rooms for storage and dressing. Because it was open to the sky, no 
roof supports obstructed the audience s view of the performance, 
and many of the seats offered spectacular vistas across the land¬ 
scape as well. Yet perhaps the most astonishing feature of the 
theater is its acoustics, which visitors can still experience: Its 
funnel shape carries the slightest whisper up to the highest points 
of the auditorium. This form is familiar to theatergoers today, a 
testament to its success. 


THE PHAROS AT ALEXANDRIA In Alexandria, on the 
northwest coast of the Nile Delta, a vast and innovative lighthouse 
was a testament to the city’s cosmopolitan nature and the vitality 
of shipping and commerce throughout the Hellenistic 
Mediterranean (fig. 5.68). Alexander the Great founded the city 
to a grid design by Dinocrites of Rhodes, but the famed light¬ 
house, or Pharos, was not begun until the reign of Ptolemy I, in 
ca. 279 bce, and was completed under his son, Ptolemy II 
Philadelphos. Some sources attribute it to an architect named 
Sostratus. The building has long collapsed, but a French team has 
recently recovered some of its blocks in underwater excavations. 
Together with mosaic depictions and medieval descriptions, 
archaeological evidence suggests a building with a square, slightly 
tapering base, an octagonal central drum, and a tholos-like 
element, crowned by a huge bronze statue at the dizzying height 
of about 400 feet. Ancient sources describe a fire at the summit,

and an annular corridor circled up through the tower, wide enough 
for mules to climb to the top with fuel—a type of petroleum called 
naphtha, perhaps, that is found in ponds. Yet archaeologists are 
uncertain how to reconcile a fire with a stone tholos, which would 
have cracked if exposed to intense heat. The building became an 
icon for the city. Its monumentality earned it a place among the 
seven wonders of the ancient world, and it was widely imitated by 
other cities. 

Hellenistic Sculpture: 

Expression and Movement 

Hellenistic sculptors also responded to the cultural changes of the 
Hellenistc world. Fourth-century bce sculptors had explored the 
portrayal of emotion and three-dimensional movement, and their 
Hellenistic successors made further radical strides in these direc¬ 
tions. Both resulted in heightened drama and viewer involvement. 
That said, one can make only broad generalizations about 
Hellenistic sculpture, as it is notoriously difficult to date and to 
attribute to a firm place of origin. Often it is style alone that leads 
scholars to ascribe a sculpture to this period, and even that is not 
always straightforward: Although there is good evidence of a 
dialogue between sculptors, they were working throughout a vast 
territory where numerous local influences were at play, making the 
body of material much less homogeneous than Classical sculpture. 

P O R TR AITU R E A chief development in sculpture in this period 
was portraiture. If Archaic artists depicted individuals at all, they 
represented them with the all-purpose figures of kouroi and

korai. Individual likenesses were unknown in art of the Classical 
period, which sought a timeless ideal. A copy of a famous sculpture 
of Perikles dating from about 425 bce, for instance, differs from 
the idealized youths of the Parthenon frieze only in that the 
Perikles wears a beard and a helmet. Later, in the mid-fourth 
century bce, portraiture became a major branch of Greek sculp¬ 
ture, and it continued to flourish in Hellenistic times. One of the 
catalysts for this change was Alexander the Great himself. 
Recognizing the power of a consistent visual image, he retained 
Lysippos as the exclusive creator of his sculpted portraits. No sur¬ 
viving original preserves Lysippos’ touch, but scholars consider 
the so-called “Azara Herm” to be relatively faithful to its model 
(fig. 5.69). To be sure, the face has an idealized quality: Its planes 
are smooth, especially around the brow. Yet individuality emerges 
in the unruly hair, raised at the front in Alexander the Great s 
characteristic cowlick (or anastole ), and in the twist of the head, 
which removes the portrait from a timeless realm and animates it

with action. Moreover, Alexander does not engage with a viewer, 
but has a distant gaze. These characteristics would become 
emblematic of Alexander, and Hellenistic and Roman generals 
would adopt them as attributes in their own portraiture. With this 
image, the individual came to inhabit the sculpture, and portrai¬ 
ture began to flourish as a genre. 

As with so many Greek sculptures, original Hellenistic por¬ 
traits are extremely rare. One is an early first-century bce bronze 
head from Delos (fig. 5.70), which may portray a trader: The 
island of Delos was a lively trading port, and many merchants 
there became extremely wealthy. Unlike the Romans, the Greeks 
did not isolate an individuals personality in portrait busts, but 
considered it to animate the full body. Thus this head is just a 
fragment of a full-length statue. The artist fused the heroic 
qualities of Alexander s likeness—the whimsical turn of the head, 
for instance, and the full head of hair—with modeled surfaces. 
The fleshy features, the uncertain mouth, and the furrowed brows 
capture an individual likeness. If they also suggest character 
traits, it is hard to read them with any precision at such a cultural 
distance. 

Like architects, Hellenistic sculptors engaged their audience in 
the experience of their work, and favored dramatic subjects 


infused with emotion. The Dying Trumpeter , preserved in a 
Roman copy (fig. 5.71), probably belonged on one of two statue 
bases found in the Sanctuary of Athena on the Akropolis of 
Pergamon, and commemorated Attalos Is defeat of the Gauls in 
about 233 bce. Gone is the Classical tradition of referring to the 
enemy through mythological analogy (see figs. 5.35 and 5.44). 
Instead, the sculptor specifically identifies the enemy as a Gaul 
through his bushy hair and moustache, and by the torque, or 
braided gold band, that he wears around his neck. Gone, too, is 
any suggestion of the inferiority of the vanquished. The Gaul dies 
nobly, sinking quietly to the ground or struggling to prop himself 
up, as blood pours from a wound in his chest. His body is pow¬ 
erful, his strength palpable. He faces his agonies alone, mindless 
of any viewer. A viewer, in turn, is drawn in by the privateness of 
the moment, and drawn around the sculpture by the pyramidal 
composition and the foreshortening witnessed from every angle. 
The Dying Trumpeter was probably one sculpture in a group, but 
the victor, always present in Classical battle scenes, was absent. 
The monument celebrates the conqueror s valor by exalting the 
enemy he overcame; the greater the enemy, the greater the victory. 
Pliny records a famous sculpture by Epigonos of a trumpet 
player, and this Roman copy may reflect that work.

DRAMATIC VICTORY MONUMENTS Sculptures decorating 
the Great Altar of Zeus at Pergamon exemplify the highly 
emotional, dramatic style at its height (figs. 5.72 and 5.73). The 
monument dates to the second quarter of the second century bce, 
when Eumenes II, or Attalos II, built it to commemorate terri¬ 
torial victories over Pontos and Bithynia and the establishment of 
a grand victory festival, the Nikephoria. The altar stood high on 
a podium within a large rectangular enclosure defined by an Ionic 
colonnade. A wide staircase at the front provided access. The 
altar and its enclosure, which both go by the name of the Great 
Altar, stood on a terrace on the Pergamene Akropolis. A German 
team excavated the monument from 1878 to 1886, and its entire 
west front, with the great flight of stairs leading to its entrance, 
has been reconstructed in Berlin (see fig. 5.72). The vast enclosure 
belongs to a long Ionian tradition of massive altars, but this is 
by far the most elaborate extant example. Its boldest feature 
is a frieze encircling the base, which extends over 400 feet in 
length and over 7 feet in height. Its subject, the Battle of the 
Gods and Giants, was a familiar theme in architectural sculpture. 
Here, as before, it worked allegorically, symbolizing Eumenes’ 
victories. Never before, however, had artists treated the subject 
so extensively or so dramatically. About 84 figures crowd the 
composition, interspersed with numerous animals. This was no 
mean feat: The designer must have relied upon research by scholars

J. J. Winckelmann and the Apollo Belvedere 


D espite the best efforts of contemporary art historians, many 
assessments of art today are deeply informed by a notion of 
beauty rooted in Greek Classicism. This bias has been present 
through the ages since antiquity; but its abiding power is also the 
legacy of a pioneering German antiquarian, Johann Joachim 
Winckelmann, who is often called the father of art history. Born in 
Stendal in Prussia in 1 71 7, Winckelmann studied in Halle and Jena 
before becoming librarian for Count Heinrich von Bunau near 
Dresden. It was in von Bunau’s library that he gained an education in 
the visual arts, which led to his first publication, Reflections on the 
Imitation of Creek Works of Art in Painting and Sculpture, in 1 755. 
In that same year he moved to Rome, and was soon appointed librar¬ 
ian and advisor to Cardinal Alessandro Albani. In 1 764, after the 
publication of his seminal History of Art of Antiquity, he became 
papal antiquary and director of antiquities in Rome. Unpublished 
Antiquities, of 1 767, was his last work before his rather ignominious 
death a year later at the hands of a petty criminal. 

The impact of his published works has been enormous. He was 
first, for instance, to determine that most Greek sculptures (which he 
often conflated with their Roman copies) represented not historical 
figures but mythological characters. Even more significant was his 
contention that Greek art captured an ideal beauty that transcended 
nature. He established a model for the development of art that 
divided art history into periods that coincided with political events. 
The Older Style was the precursor to the High or Sublime Style. Next 
came the Beautiful Style, and finally the Style of the Imitators. In 
ancient art, these correspond to the Archaic, fifth-century bce 
Classical, Late Classical, and Hellenistic and Roman periods. This 
progression from rise to eventual decline still lies at the heart of 
most studies of art history, regardless of the era. When it came to 
assigning works of art to these phases, Winckelmann was, in a sense, 
trapped by his own scheme. Reluctant to allot works he admired to 
the “decline” phase of Hellenistic and Roman art, he often dated 
sculptures much too early; such was the case with the Laocoon 
(see The Art Historian’s Lens, page 183), which he placed in the 
fourth century bce, and the Apollo Belvedere, which he considered a 
Greek original. 

The Apollo Belvedere first came to light again in the fifteenth cen¬ 
tury ce, and quickly made its way into the collection of Pope Julius II. 
It represents the god in an open pose, with his left arm outstretched, 
perhaps to hold a bow. Winckelmann was one of many antiquarians 
to be profoundly moved by the statue. Combined in its form he 
perceived both power and desirability, and he penned a rhapsodic 
description of it that is tinged with eroticizing overtones. “I forget all 
else at the sight of this miracle of art,” he wrote. “My breast seems to 
enlarge and swell with reverence.” Few scholars share his enthusiasm 
for the piece today. Its significance for art historians resides more in 
its modern reception—the role it played for admiring Renaissance 
artists, for instance—than in its place in ancient culture. As for its 
date, most scholars now identify it as a second-century ce copy or 
interpretation of a Greek original; the latter is sometimes attributed 
to Leochares, who worked at the end of the fourth century bce.

THE ANCIENT WORLD 










with creating a balanced and resonant composition, for despite 
the chaotic appearance of the melee, guiding principles lurk 
behind it. Modern scholars still struggle to understand these 
principles fully, even with the help of inscriptions naming some 
of the gods on the molding in the entablature and giants on the 
base molding. On the eastern frieze, facing the sanctuary’s great 
propylon and the rising sun, were the Olympian gods. The most 
prominent position belonged to Athena. On the south, drenched 
in sun, were heavenly lights such as Helios; on the shadowy north 
were divinities of the night. Deities of the earth and sea were on 
the west. Compositional parallels unified the four sides. The 
frieze is direct evidence of the Hellenistic scholarly tradition 
at work. 

On the other hand, it is also deeply imbued with Hellenistic 
theatricality. Sculptors carved the figures so deeply, and undercut 
them in places so forcefully, that they are almost in the round. The 
high relief creates a vivid interplay of light and dark, and on the 
staircase, the figures seem to spill out onto the steps and climb 
alongside an ascending visitor. Muscular bodies rush at each other, 
overlapping and entwining (see fig. 5.73). The giants’ snaky 
extremities twist and curl, echoed in their deeply drilled tendrils 
of ropelike hair. Wings beat and garments blow furiously in the 
wind or twist around those they robe, not to reveal the anatomy 
beneath but to create motion; they have a life of their own and 
their texture contrasts with the smoothness of the giants’ flesh. 
The giants’ emotion is palpable: They agonize in the torment of 
their defeat, their brows creased in pain, their eyes deep-set in an 
exaggerated style reminiscent of Skopas. A writhing motion 
pervades the entire design, and links the figures in a single contin¬ 
uous rhythm. This rhythm, and the quiet Classicism of the gods’ 
faces, so starkly opposed to the giants’ faces, create a unity that 
keeps the violence of the struggle from exploding its architectural 
frame—but only just. For the first time in the long tradition of its 
depiction, a viewer has a visceral sense of what a terrible cosmic 
crisis this battle would be. 

The weight and solidity of the great gigantomachy make it a 
fitting frieze for its place on the building’s platform. A second, 
lighter frieze encircled the inside of the colonnade, and may 
be slightly later. This frieze portrays the life of Telephos, son 
of Herakles and legendary founder of Mysia, the region of 
Pergamon. 

Though an altar first and foremost, the Great Altar of Zeus 
also commemorates Eumenes’ victory. Its magnificence under¬ 
scores the precariousness of the Hellenistic world, and the 
importance of conquest to a ruler’s image. Dramatic location and 
style combine in another victory monument of the early second 
century bce, the Nike of Samothrace (fig. 5.74). The sculpture 
probably celebrates the naval victories —nike means “victory”— 
of Eudamos, an admiral in command of the fleet at Rhodes, over 
Antiochos the Great and the Seleucid forces in 190 bce. The 
Rhodian marble of the sculpture’s base, and evidence from 
inscriptions, suggest that the sculpture comes from Rhodes, and 
may be the work of the renowned artist Pythokritos from that 
island. The victory goddess seems to be landing on the prow of a 


ship, as if to bestow a crown of victory upon Eudamos. 
Alternatively, she could be about to take flight. Her massive 
wings soar out behind her, stretching the limits of the marble’s 
tensile strength. The lift of the wings makes the whole statue 
appear weightless, despite the great mass of stone: In a new 
variant of the chiastic stance, neither leg holds the body’s full 
weight. The wings and the drapery give the sculpture its energy. 
The drapery swirls around the goddess’s body, exposing her 
anatomy and stressing the sensuous curves of her form. Yet it has 
its own function as well: Its swirling motion suggests the head¬ 
wind she struggles against, which, in turn, balances the rushing 
forward thrust of her arrival. The drapery creates the environ¬ 
ment around the figure. 

This sculpture is a rare instance of a monument coming to 
light, in 1863, in its original location—in the Sanctuary of the 
Great Gods at Samothrace, where it must have been a dedication. 
The stone prow stood high on a terrace overlooking the theater 
and the sea, within a pool of water that must have reflected the 
Nike’s white marble forms. The pool was raised above a second 
water basin filled with rocks, to evoke a coastline. 

PLAYFULNESS IN SCULPTURE Scholars use the term 
baroque to describe the extreme emotions, extravagant gestures, 
and theatrical locations that characterize the Great Altar of Zeus 
and the Nike of Samothrace. Art historians first used the word 
to describe seventeenth-century ce art, but the scholars of 
Hellenistic art borrowed it on recognizing similarities between 
the two styles. With its dramatic qualities, the Hellenistic baroque 
style has tended to eclipse the many other contemporary move¬ 
ments in sculpture. One of these is a penchant for works of a 
light-hearted and sometimes faintly erotic quality. These appear 
to be a reaction to the weightiness of the baroque style, and some¬ 
times they have an element of parody to them, suggesting that 
the sculptor hoped to reduce the grand themes of the classical and 
baroque styles to a comical level. Scholars describe these works 
somewhat inadequately by the term Rococo, which they also 
borrow from scholarship on later European art. Some of them 
represent amorous interactions between divine or semidivine 
and human figures. In the example shown here, dating to about 
100 bce, Aphrodite wields a slipper to fend off the advances of a 
lecherous Pan, the half-man, half-goat god of the forests 
(fig. 5.75). Eros hovers mischievously between them. With her 
sensuous roundness and her modest hand gesture, the goddess 
recalls Praxiteles’ bathing Aphrodite of Knidos (see fig. 5.56). 
Here, the erotic possibilities that Praxiteles dangled provocatively 
in the air are unambiguously answered, and by a humorously 
undesirable partner. Rather than grasping for her drapery to 
preserve her dignity, the majestic Aphrodite is reduced to grab¬ 
bing a slipper in self-defense. This sculpture is another rare exam¬ 
ple of a Greek original found in the location in which it was used 
in antiquity. Archaeologists unearthed it in the clubhouse of a 
group of merchants from Berytus (Beirut) on Delos. Still, it is 
unclear whether the sculptural group was a cult image or a 
decorative piece.

HELLENISTIC REALISM Scholars sometimes group these 
light-hearted sculptures together with a series of works depicting 
unidealized and realistic everyday life. Their genre is known as 
Hellenistic realism, and a sculpture of a drunken old woman illus¬ 
trates it well (fig. 5.76). Known from Roman copies, this piece has 
at times been ascribed to Myron of Thebes, who may have 
worked at Pergamon. The evidence is slim, and the figure may fit 
better with the cultural context of Alexandria, where realism 
seems to have been particularly prevalent. The woman crouches 
on the ground, clasping a wine bottle, her head flung far back. 


Wrinkles cover her face, and the skin on her exposed shoulder and 
chest sags with age. She wears a buckled tunic, which identifies 
her as a member of an affluent social class. Other sculptures of 
this kind focus on the ravaging effects of a rustic life on the 
poor—an old shepherdess, for instance; yet in this sculpture, the 
artist explores drunkenness and old age. With her wine jar and her 
garment slipping from her shoulder, she may even be in ironic 
dialogue with figures of Aphrodite with her water vessel (see fig. 
5.56). Without further insights into the cultural context for the 
image, it is hard to know if the sculptor intended to offer a sym¬ 
pathetic view of his subject, exalting her nobility, or to engage in 
hard social commentary

5.77 The Abduction of Persephone, Tomb I, Vergina, Macedonia (detail), ca. 340-330 bce 


Hellenistic Painting 

It was in the fourth century bce that Greek wall painting came 
into its own. Pliny names a number of leading painters, but no 
surviving work can be attributed to them to give proof of his 
words. (See www.myartslab.com .) All the same, paintings are pre¬ 
served in Macedonian tombs, several of which have recently 
come—and keep coming—to light in northern Greece (in the 
region of Macedonia). These tombs are of great importance 
because they contain the only surviving relatively complete Greek 
wall paintings, and offer a tantalizing glimpse of what painters 


could accomplish. The section shown here (fig. 5.77) comes from 
a small tomb at Vergina, dating to about 340-330 bce. The sub¬ 
ject, the abduction of Persephone, is appropriate to the funereal 
setting. Pluto, ruler of the underworld, carries away Persephone 
to be his queen. Thanks to Zeus’ intervention, Persephone would 
be allowed to return to the world of the living for six months of 
every year. Here, the artist has chosen the moment when Pluto 
seizes Persephone into his speeding chariot, her handmaiden rear¬ 
ing back in fright and horror. This is the most harrowing moment, 
before Persephone knows that Zeus will find a compromise, when

her futile struggle seems the only possible escape from the under¬ 
world. The painting captures all of the myths drama. Persephone 
flings her body backward, while the chariot rushes onward with 
her captor; their bodies cross as a sign of conflict. The chariot 
plunges toward a viewer, its wheel sharply foreshortened. 
Masterful brushwork animates the scene. With swift flourishes, 
the artist sends hair and drapery flying, and lends plasticity to the 
garments. Hatchwork rounds out the bodies 5 flesh, as on the arms 
and shoulders. The colors are brilliant washes, with shading for 
texture. Literary sources attribute the discovery of shading (the 
modulation of volume by means of contrasting light and shade), 
known as skiagraphia, to a painter named Apollodorus, who used 
the technique perhaps as early as the fifth century bce. They also 
associate spatial perspective (rendering recession of space) with 
Agatharchos and the art of stage scenery during the heyday of 
Athenian drama. The exploration and perfection of both devices 
during the course of the fourth century bce illustrate the fascina¬ 
tion with illusionism at this time. 

Roman copies and imitations may also provide a general 
impression of Greek wall painting. According to Pliny, at the end 
of the fourth century bce, Philoxenos of Eretria painted 
Alexander the Great s victory over Darius III at Issos. This is the 
subject of a large and masterful floor mosaic from a Pompeian 
house of about 100 bce (fig. 5.78), which could be a copy of 
Philoxenos 5 painting. Yet a female painter named Helen, from 


Alexandria, also painted the subject, and most scholars believe the 
mosaic copies her work. It depicts Darius and the fleeing Persians 
on the right and, in the badly damaged left-hand portion, the 
figure of Alexander. The mosaic follows a four-color scheme (yel¬ 
low, red, black, and white) that is known to have been widely used 
in the late fourth century bce. (See www.myartslab.com .) The 
crowding, the air of frantic excitement, the powerfully modeled 
and foreshortened forms, and the precise shadows also place the 
scene in the fourth century bce, as does the minimal treatment of 
landscape, suggested by a single barren tree to the left of center. 

The abundance of surviving Greek art from a period of over 
seven centuries is a testimony to great intellectual fervor and 
political change. Devastating wars with their own and neighbor¬ 
ing peoples continually shaped Greek culture and art. In the 
course of those centuries, Greek art changed almost unrecogniz¬ 
ably. From the abstract forms of the Geometric period, it trans¬ 
formed itself into the myriad styles of the Hellenistic period. To 
be sure, the quest for naturalism in sculpture and painting was a 
driving force in this change. Yet that quest in art was merely part 
of a more pervasive philosophical outlook, which led to a fascina¬ 
tion with proportions and with scholarly analysis of the arts. 
If the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, and the Macedonian 
conquests took their toll, they also fueled the urge to express 
emotion in the visual arts, and to appeal to an individuals 
personal experience of the world.

Etruscan Art 



E arly etruscan culture, known as villanovan, appeared on 

the Italian peninsula in the tenth century bce. Who the Etruscans were 
remains a mystery; even in antiquity, writers disputed their origins. The 
Greek historian Herodotus believed that they had left their homeland of 
Lydia in Asia Minor in about 1200 bce, and settled in what are now the Italian 


regions of Tuscany, Umbria, and Lazio (map 6.1). Recent DNA 
sampling may support his view. Others claimed they were indige¬ 
nous. Wherever they came from, the Etruscans had strong 
cultural links with Asia Minor and the ancient Near East. In 
fact, their visual culture is a rich blend of distinctly Etruscan traits 
with influences from the East and from Greece. Since Greek city- 
states had established colonies in Italy from the eighth century 
bce, contact between the two cultures was inevitable. The close 
relationship between Etruscan and Greek art forms has led schol¬ 
ars to define the stylistic periods of Etruscan art with terms that 
are similar to those used for Greece. Toward the end of the eighth 
century bce the Etruscans began to use the Greek alphabet, and 
this makes it possible to read their inscriptions, which survive in 
the thousands; but since their language is unrelated to any other, 
we cannot always understand their meaning. 

The Etruscans reached the height of their power in the seventh 
and sixth centuries bce, coinciding with the Archaic period in 
Greece. They amassed great wealth from mining metals, and their 
cities rivaled those of the Greeks; their fleet dominated the west¬ 
ern Mediterranean and protected a vast commercial network that 
competed with the Greeks and Phoenicians; and their territory 
extended from the lower Po Valley in the north to Naples in the 
south. But, like the Greeks, the Etruscans never formed a unified 

Detail of figure 6.6, Charun from the Tomb of the Anina Family 


nation. They remained a loose federation of individual city-states, 
united by a common language and religion, but given to conflict 
and slow to unite against a common enemy. This may have been 
one cause of their gradual downfall. In 474 bce, the Etruscans’ 
archrival, Syracuse, defeated the Etruscan fleet. And during the 
later fifth and fourth centuries bce, one Etruscan city after 
another fell to the Romans. By 270 bce, all the Etruscan city- 
states had lost their independence to Rome, although if we are to 
judge by the splendor of their tombs during this period of politi¬ 
cal struggle, many still prospered. 

The bulk of our knowledge about Etruscan culture comes 
from art, and especially from their monumental tombs. These 
structures provide information about Etruscan building practices, 
and artists often painted them with scenes that reveal a glimpse of 
Etruscan life. Objects found within them attest to the Etruscans’ 
reputation as fine sculptors and metalworkers. Large numbers of 
painted vases from Athens have also come to light in tombs, 
demonstrating the Etruscans’ close trade ties with Greece. 

FUNERARY ART 

As with burials elsewhere in prehistoric Europe, early burials 
on the Italian peninsula were modest. The living either buried 
the deceased in shallow graves or cremated them, and placed 
the ashes, in a pottery vessel or cinerary urn, in a simple pit. 


CHAPTER 6 ETRUSCAN ART 


165 


CHAPTER 




Sometimes they buried offerings with the dead—weapons for 
men, and jewelry and weaving implements for women. Early in 
the seventh century bce, as Etruscans began to bury their dead in 
family groups, funerary customs for men and women became 
more elaborate, and the tombs of the wealthy gradually trans¬ 
formed into monumental structures. 


Tombs and Their Contents 

Named for the amateur archaeologists who excavated it, the 
Regolini-Galassi Tomb at Cerveteri is an early example of this 
more elaborate burial practice, dating to the so-called 
Orientalizing phase of the mid-seventh century bce, when 
Etruscan arts show a marked influence from Eastern motifs. 
Etruscans formed tombs in the shape of mounds called tumuli, 
which were grouped together outside the living spaces of 
Etruscan towns to create a city of the dead, or necropolis. In this 
example, builders roofed the long dromos (plural, dromoi) or

decorative safety pin, and often served to hold a garment together 
at the neck. At 11 X A inches in length, this magnificent example is a 
tour de force of the goldsmiths art (see Materials and Techniques , 
page 169), and justifies the fame Etruscan goldsmiths enjoyed in 
antiquity. Covering the lower leaflike portion are 55 gold ducks in 
the round. On the upper portion, shaped like a three-quarter- 
moon, repousse work defines pacing lions, whose profile pose 
and erect stance may derive from Phoenician precedents. Indeed, 
though the workmanship is probably Etruscan, the animal motifs 
suggest familiarity with the artworks of Near Eastern cultures 
(see fig. 2.10). Also buried in tombs of this time were precious 
objects imported from the ancient Near East, such as ivories. 


The Regolini-Galassi Tomb is but one of many tumulus tombs 
built at necropoleis near Cerveteri over the course of several cen¬ 
turies until about 100 bce (fig. 6.2). The local stone is a soft 
volcanic rock known as tuff which is easy to cut and hardens after 
prolonged exposure to the air. Those who created the tumuli 
excavated into bedrock, cutting away a path and burial chambers. 
They used excavated stone to build a circular retaining wall 
around the chambers, and piled up soil above it. Often several 
dromoi led to independent networks of chambers within a single 
mound. The layout of the burial chambers varies (fig. 6.3), and 
scholars have supposed that these dwellings of the dead mimicked 
contemporary houses, often complete with chairs or beds carved

out of the rock as furnishing. This may be true, but it is hard to 
confirm given the scant evidence for Etruscan residences. In a late 
example, the Tomb of the Reliefs at Cerveteri, an artist applied 
everything the dead might want in the afterlife onto the walls in 
stucco (fig. 6.4). Reproductions of weapons, armor, household 
implements, and domestic animals cover the piers and the walls 
between the niches. Two damaged busts may have represented the 
dead or underworld deities. The concept of burying items that 
would be of service in the afterlife is reminiscent of Egyptian 
funerary practice, though replicas of actual items differ markedly 
between the two cultures. 


Farther north, at Tarquinia, tombs consist of chambers sunk 
into the earth with a steep underground dromos. Vibrant paint¬ 
ings cover the walls, executed while the plaster was wet. At one 
end of the low chamber in the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing is a 
marine panorama, dating to about 530-520 bce (fig. 6.5) during 
the Archaic period. In the vast expanse of water and sky, fisher¬ 
men cast lines from a boat, as brightly colored dolphins leap 
through the waves. A figure on a rocky promontory aims his 
slingshot at large birds in bright red, blue, and yellow that swoop 
through the sky. Unlike Greek landscape scenes, where humans 
dominate their surroundings, here the figures are just one part of

Etruscan Gold-Working 

E arly in their history, the Etruscans became talented metalworkers, 
with special proficiency in gold-working. The goldsmith responsible 
for the fibula in figure 6.1 was a master of two complex techniques: 
filigree and granulation. 

Filigree is the art of soldering fine gold wires—singly or twisted 
together into a rope—onto a gold background. The goldsmith used 
this process to outline the ornamental decoration and two-dimensional 
animals on the fibula’s surface. Etruscan artists were so expert that 
they could even create openwork designs independent of a backplate. 

Granulation describes the process of soldering tiny gold balls or 
grains onto a background. Skilled Etruscan artists worked with grains 
as small as /so", using them to decorate large areas, or to define linear 
or geometric patterns. Alternatively, they might employ them in con¬ 
junction with embossed designs, or in a mass to create a silhouette 
against the background. Finally, they might cover the background with 
grains, leaving a design in silhouette. 

Mastery of granulation was lost in early medieval Europe, as tastes 
changed and different gold-working techniques came to be preferred. 
Goldsmiths use various methods today, but scholars do not know how 
Etruscan artists prepared the grains. They may have placed fragments 
of gold in a crucible, separating them with charcoal. When heated, the 
gold would melt into separate balls. Goldsmiths would then remove 
the charcoal that kept the balls apart. Alternatively, they may have 
poured molten gold into water from a height, to ensure that tiny grains 
would form into small balls. When the liquid metal reached the water, 
it would cool into solid form. For all but the simplest designs (which

were applied straight to the background), the artist probably arranged 
the grains in a design engraved on a stone or metal plate, and lowered 
a piece of adhesive-covered papyrus or leather, fixed to the end of a 
tube, over the design, to pick up the grains. They could then be 
treated with solder and transferred to the gold backplate.

a larger scheme. The exuberance of the colors and gestures, too, is 
characteristically Etruscan. All the same, here as in most tombs, 
the treatment of drapery and anatomy reveals that developing 
Greek painting influenced Etruscan tomb painters. 

The artist seems to have conceived of the scene as a view from 
a tent or hut, defined by wide bands of color at cornice level and 
roofed with a light tapestry. Hanging from the cornice are festive 
garlands of the kind probably used during funerary rituals. In 
many tombs, images of animals fill the gable —leopards, some¬ 
times, or fantastic hybrids—perhaps used as guardian figures to 
ward off evil. Above the fishing scene, a man and woman recline 
together at a banquet, where musicians entertain them and ser¬ 
vants attend to their needs. One draws wine from a large mixing 
bowl, or krater, while another makes wreaths. In contrast to 
Greek drinking parties (symposia), which were reserved for men 
and courtesans, Etruscan banquet scenes include respectable 
women reclining alongside men. Banquet paintings appear fre¬ 
quently in Etruscan tombs; athletic games were another common 
subject, as were scenes that focused on musicians and dancers. 

The purpose of these paintings is hard to determine. They may 
record and perpetuate activities the deceased once enjoyed, or 


depict rituals observed at the funeral (the games, in fact, are prob¬ 
ably the forerunners of Roman gladiatorial contests). Or, like 
Egyptian tomb paintings, they may have served as provisions for 
the afterlife of the deceased. At the heart of the problem of inter¬ 
pretation lies our general ignorance about Etruscan beliefs con¬ 
cerning death and the afterlife. Roman writers describe them as a 
highly religious people, and their priests are known to have read 
meaning into the flight of birds in different sectors of the sky; 
beyond that, as enigmatic as they are, these paintings actually con¬ 
stitute a large part of our evidence for understanding Etruscan 
beliefs. In a few tombs, paintings seem to reflect Greek myths, 
but these images merely compound the problem, since we 
cannot be sure that the Etruscans intended the same meaning as 
Greek artists. 

However we interpret these Archaic and Classical images, it 
is clear that a distinct change in the content of tomb paintings 
begins in the Late Classical period during the fourth century bce. 
An overwhelming sense of sadness replaces the energetic mood 
of the foregoing periods. The exuberant palette of the earlier 
phases, with its bright reds and yellows, gives way to a somber 
range of darker colors. At this time, funerary images often depict 


170 PART

processions taking the deceased to a world of the dead, or they 
are set in a shadowy underworld. In the Tomb of the Anina 
Family at Tarquinia, dating to about the end of the fourth century 
bce, two winged demons flank a door to another world (fig. 6.6). 

A hook-nosed male demon Charun, on the left, is the souls 
guide to the underworld. He holds the hammer with which he 
will open the door, while Vanth, a female demon on the right, 
bears a torch to light the darkness. It is possible that the gloomy 
subjects reflected difficult times, as they coincide with the Roman 
conquest and subordination of Etruscan cities. 

Containers used for the remains of the dead manifest similar 
changes. In the Orientalizing period, the pottery urns tradition¬ 
ally used for ashes gradually took on human characteristics 
(fig. 6.7). The lid became a head, perhaps intended to represent the 
deceased, and body markings appeared on the vessel itself. Hair 
and jewelry may have been attached where holes appear in the 
terra-cotta surface. Sometimes the urn was placed on a sort of 
throne in the tomb, which may have indicated a high status for 
the deceased. 

In Cerveteri, two monumental sarcophagi of the Archaic 
period have come to light, molded in terra cotta in two separate 
halves. One of them, dating to about 520 bce, is shown here (fig. 

6.8). The artist shaped the lid to resemble a couch, and reclining 
side by side on top are full-length sculptures of a man and 

woman, presumably a married couple. A wineskin (a soft canteen __ TT . , . .

out objects in their hands—a cup or an alabastron (a perfume 
container), perhaps, or an egg, symbol of eternity. Despite the 
abstract forms and rigid poses of the Archaic style, the soft mate¬ 
rial allows the sculptor to model rounded forms and capture an 
extraordinary directness and vivacity. The artist painted the entire 
work in bright colors, which conservators have revealed more 
clearly in a recent cleaning. 

The change in mood, from optimistic to somber, that charac¬ 
terizes tomb paintings between the fifth and fourth centuries bce 


also becomes apparent if we compare the sarcophagus in figure 
6.8 with a cinerary container made of soft stone soon after 400 
bce (fig. 6.9). At one end reclines a young man wearing his man¬ 
tle pulled down around his waist, in the Etruscan style. As in wall 
paintings of this period, a woman sits at the foot of the couch. Yet 
she is not his wife. Her wings identify her as a demon from the 
world of the dead, and the scroll in her left hand may record his 
fate. The two figures set at either end of the couch create a bal¬ 
anced composition, but their separation marks a new mood of

melancholy associated with death, which each individual must 
face alone. Still, wealthy Etruscans continued to bury their dead 
together in family tombs, and the familial context for cinerary 
urns like this one must have gone some way toward mitigating the 
isolation of death (fig. 6.10). Moreover, while cinerary urns of this 
kind were typical, usually with a single figure reclining on the lid, 
a few grand sarcophagi survive. On the lid of one are carved a 
man and woman in a tender embrace, lying under a sheet as if 
in their marital bed (fig. 6.11). The coiffures and beard reflect 
Greek fashion, and the sides of the chest feature battle scenes 
influenced by Greek iconography, yet the finished product is 
definitively Etruscan. 


ARCHITECTURE 

According to Roman writers, the Etruscans were masters of 
engineering, town planning, and surveying. Almost certainly, the 
Romans learned from them, especially in water management 
(drainage systems and aqueducts) and bridge building. Exactly 
what they learned is hard to determine, however. Since it was built 
predominantly of wood or mud brick, relatively little Etruscan 
and early Roman architecture survives. Additionally, many 
Etruscan towns lie beneath existing Italian towns, and any 
permanent materials employed in their construction have often 
been reused. 

Etruscan cities generally sat on hilltops close to a navigable 
river or the sea. From the seventh century bce on, in some places 
the inhabitants added massive defensive walls. A late example of 
civic architecture survives in the city of Perugia, where sections of 
a fortification wall and some of its gates still stand. The best- 
known of these is the Porta Marzia (Gate of Mars) of the second 
century bce, the upper portion of which the Renaissance architect 
Antonio da Sangallo encased in a later wall (fig. 6.12). The gate is 
an early example of a voussoir arch, built out of a series of trun¬ 
cated wedge-shaped stones called voussoirs set in a semicircle 
against a wooden framework, which was removed after construc¬ 
tion. Once the voussoirs were in place, they were remarkably 
strong; any downward thrust from above (the weight of the wall 
over the void, for instance) merely strengthened their bond by 
pressing them more tightly against one another. Above the arch, 
and separated from one another by engaged pilasters, sculpted fig¬ 
ures of Tinia (the Etruscan equivalent of Zeus or Jupiter) and his 
sons (equivalent to Castor and Pollux) with their horses look out 
over a balustrade. The arch is visual evidence of the confluence of

CHAPTER 6 ETRUSCAN ART 173 
























cultures so prevalent in the Mediterranean in the last centuries 
before the Common Era. 

City Planning 

The hilltops of Etruria did not lend themselves to grid planning, 
yet there is good evidence at sites like Marzabotto that when the 
Etruscans colonized the flatlands of the Po Valley in northern 
Italy, from the sixth century bce on, they laid out newly founded 
cities as a network of streets. These centered on the intersection of 
two main thoroughfares, one running north-south (known in 
Latin as the cardo) and one running east-west (the decumanus). 
The resulting four quarters could be further subdivided or 
expanded, according to need. This system seems consistent with 
religious beliefs that led the Etruscans to divide the sky into 
regions according to the points of the compass. The Romans also 
adopted it for the new colonies they founded throughout Italy, 
Western Europe, and North Africa, and for military camps. 

Little survives of the houses that composed Etruscan towns. 
Unlike tombs, they were built with a packed-earth technique 
(pise) similar to wattle and daub or adobe, with only the base 
made of stone. Even these stone footprints are hard to discern, 
since the hilltops favored by the Etruscans have been inhabited 
more or less continually since their days. In a few places, however, 
archaeologists have unearthed the remains of monumental build¬ 
ing complexes that may have been palaces or large villas. An espe¬ 
cially fine example existed at Poggio Civitate (present-day Murlo) 
in the sixth century bce, where numerous rooms framed a large 
central courtyard (fig. 6.13). This kind of architecture is concep¬ 
tually linked to typically Roman atrium houses (see fig. 7.50). In 
order to protect the wooden fabric of their monumental build¬ 
ings, Etruscans nailed terra-cotta revetment plaques over exposed 
parts of beams. A mid-sixth-century bce monumental residential 
building at Acquarossa yielded a fine set of molded and painted

revetments. One of them shows a banquet scene, with diners on 
couches amid musicians (fig. 6.14), and others depicted Herakles 
accomplishing his labors. With their bright colors, the revetments 
enlivened the building, but they may also have aligned the elite 
property owners with the Greek hero. 

Etruscans built their temples of mud brick and wood, so once 
again only the stone foundations survive. Early temples consisted 
of little more than modest rectangular cellas (rooms for holding 
cult figures). Later temples seem to have fallen heavily under the 
influence of the innovative design of the massive Temple of 
Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill in Rome (see 
fig. 7.1). As a result, they are characterized by a tall base, or 
podium, with steps only on the front (fig. 6.15). The steps lead to 
a deep porch with rows of columns, and to the cella beyond,

which was often subdivided into three compartments. The terra¬ 
cotta tile roof hung well over the walls in wide eaves, to protect 
the mud bricks from rain, and terra-cotta revetments sheathed 
the beams. 

SCULPTURE 

As with their Greek counterparts, Etruscan temples were highly 
ornate, but where Greeks used marble to adorn their temples, 
Etruscans had little access to this material. The decoration on 
Etruscan temples usually consisted of the brightly painted 
terra-cotta revetments that protected the architrave and the edges 
of the roof. After about 400 bce, Etruscan artists sometimes 
designed large-scale terra-cotta groups to fill the pediment above 
the porch. The most dramatic use of sculpture, however, was on 
the ridgepole—the horizontal beam at the crest of a gabled roof. 
Terra-cotta figures at this height depicted not only single figures 
but narratives. 

Dynamism in Terra Cotta and Bronze 

One of the most famous surviving temple sculptures comes from 
Veii, a site some 14 miles (22 km) north of Rome. Both Roman 
texts and archaeological evidence indicate that Veii was an impor¬ 
tant sculptural center by the end of the sixth century bce. 

The late sixth-century bce temple at Veii was probably 
devoted to the Etruscan gods Menrva, Aritimi, and Turan. Four 
life-size terra-cotta statues crowned the ridge of the roof. (Similar 
examples appear in the reconstruction model, see fig. 6.15.) They 
formed a dynamic and interactive group representing the contest 
of Hercle (equivalent to Hercules) and Aplu (Apollo) for the 
sacred hind (female deer) in the presence of other deities. The 
best-preserved of the figures is Aplu (fig. 6.16). He wears a man¬ 
tle with curved hem later known to Romans as a toga. The drap¬ 
ery falls across his form in ornamental patterns and exposes his

massive body, with its sinewy, muscular legs. The stylistic similar¬ 
ity to contemporary Greek kouroi and korai signals the influence 
Greek sculpture must have had on the Etruscans. Yet this god 
moves in a hurried, purposeful stride that has no equivalent in 
free-standing Greek statues of the same date. Rendered in terra 
cotta, which allowed the sculptor greater freedom than stone to 
experiment with poses, this is a purely Etruscan energy. These 
sculptures have been attributed to a famous Etruscan sculptor, 
Vulca of Veii, celebrated in Latin literary sources. 

Etruscan sculptors also demonstrated extraordinary skill as 
bronze-casters. One of the most renowned works of Etruscan 


sculpture is the bronze She-Wolf now housed in the Capitoline 
Museums in Rome (fig. 6.17). Its most likely date is the fifth cen¬ 
tury bce, and, judging by its workmanship, it is probably by the 
hand of an Etruscan artist. The stylized, patterned treatment of 
the wolf s mane and hackles sets off the bold but smoothly mod¬ 
eled muscularity of her body, tensed for attack. Simple lines aug¬ 
ment her power: The straight back and neck contrast with the 
sharp turn of the head toward a viewer, highlighting her ferocity. 
So polished is the metal s surface that it almost seems wet; her 
fangs seem to glisten. The early history and subject matter of this 
statue is unknown. However, evidence suggests that it was highly 


176 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 







valued in later antiquity, particularly by the Romans. According 
to Roman legend, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, descen¬ 
dants of refugees from Troy in Asia Minor, founded Rome in 
753/52 bce. Abandoned as babies, they were nourished by a she- 
wolf in the wild. Romans may have seen in this Etruscan bronze 
a representation of their legendary mother wolf. In fact, the early 
fourth-century ce emperor Maxentius built a grand palace in 
Rome, where, in a large exedra (alcove) framed by a walkway, 
archaeologists found a statue base with fittings that exactly match 
the footprints of the she-wolf. A later sculptor—probably 
Antonio Polaiuolo—added the twins Romulus and Remus 
beneath her between 1471 and 1473, to resemble Roman coin 
images of the lactating she-wolf with the babies. 

The Etruscan concern with images of the dead might lead us 
to expect an early interest in portraiture. Yet the features of funer¬ 
ary images such as those in figures 6.8 and 6.9 are stylized rather 
than individualized. Not until a century later, toward 300 bce, did 
individual likenesses begin to appear in Etruscan sculpture. Greek 
portraiture may have influenced the change, but terra cotta, the 
material of so much Etruscan sculpture, lent itself to easy model¬ 
ing of distinctive facial features and a sensitive treatment of flesh, 
and must have facilitated the development of the genre. The artist 
individualized an example from Cerveteri by giving it protruding

ears, a crooked nose, and blond hair. Many Etruscan portraits, 
like this one, come from votive deposits, where Etruscans left 
them as offerings to the gods (fig. 6.18). 

Etruscan artists also produced fine portraits in bronze. A life- 
size sculpture of an orator known today as UArringatore (the 
Orator) shows how impressive their full-length sculptures were 
(fig. 6.19). Most scholars place this sculpture in the early years of 
the first century bce. It comes from Lake Trasimene, in the cen¬ 
tral Etruscan territory, and bears an Etruscan inscription that 
includes the name Aule Meteli (Aulus Metellus in Latin), presum¬ 
ably the name of the person it represents. The inscription shows 
that the workmanship is Etruscan, yet the high boots mark the

subject as Roman, or at least an official appointed by the Romans. 
The raised arm, a gesture that denotes both address and salutation, 
is common to hundreds of Roman statues. The sculpture raises 
questions about the roles of artist and patron in the conquered 
Etruscan territories. The high quality of the casting and finishing 
of Etruscan bronze works bears out their fame as metalworkers. 
Their skill is hardly surprising in a land whose wealth was 
founded on the exploitation of copper, iron, and silver deposits. 

From the sixth century bce on, Etruscans produced large 
numbers of bronze statuettes, mirrors, and other objects for 
domestic use and for export. They often engraved the backs of 
mirrors with scenes from Etruscan versions of Greek myths 
devoted to the loves of the gods. Such amorous subjects were 
appropriate for objects used for self-admiration. The design on 
the back of a mirror created soon after 400 bce (fig. 6.20) is of a 
different genre, and shows how the Etruscans adapted Greek tra¬ 
ditions to their own ends. Within an undulating wreath of vines 
stands a winged old man, one foot raised upon a rock. An inscrip¬ 
tion identifies him as the seer Chalchas, an Etruscan version of the 
Greek figure known from Homers Iliad. Yet this is the full extent 
of the borrowing, for the wings make the figure entirely Etruscan, 
and he is engaged in haruspicy, a pursuit that was central to 
Etruscan ritual: He is gazing intently at the liver of a sacrificial 
animal, searching for omens or portents. The Etruscans believed 


that signs in the natural world, such as thunderstorms or, as we 
have seen, the flight of birds, or even the entrails of sacrificed ani¬ 
mals, expressed the will of the gods. In fact, they viewed the liver 
as a sort of microcosm, divided into sections that corresponded to 
the 16 regions of the sky. By reading natural signs, those priests 
who were skilled in the arts of augury, as this practice was also 
called, could determine whether the gods approved or disap¬ 
proved of their acts. These priests enjoyed great prestige and 
power, and they continued to thrive long after the Romans had 
subordinated Etruscan culture. The Romans themselves con¬ 
sulted them before any major public or private event. As the 
Roman philosopher and statesman Seneca wrote: “This is the 
difference between us and the Etruscans...Since they attribute 
everything to divine agency, they are of the opinion that things do 
not reveal the future because they have occurred, but that they 
occur because they are meant to reveal the future. ” Mirrors, too, 
were valued for their ability to reveal the future, which is proba¬ 
bly why the artist represented this scene here. 

Etruscan artists and architects show immense skill and versa¬ 
tility when working in many different mediums. Their work is 
a true product of the Mediterranean crossroads. Their Greek 
counterparts exerted some influence on them, and they exchanged 
inspiration with the Romans. Still, Etruscan works stand 
distinctly apart.

Roman Art 


O F ALL THE CIVILIZATIONS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD, THE MOST 

accessible to modern scholars is that of ancient Rome. Romans built 
countless monuments throughout their empire, many of which are 
extraordinarily well preserved. A vast literary legacy, ranging from 
poetry and histories to inscriptions that recorded everyday events, also reveals 


a great deal about Roman culture. Yet few questions are more 
difficult to address than “What is Roman art? ” 

Rome was a significant power in the Mediterranean from the 
fifth century bce until the fourth century ce. At the Empire s 
height, its borders stretched from present-day Morocco to Iran, 
and from Egypt to Scotland (map 7.1). Greece was a relatively 
early addition to Roman territory, and much of Roman public art 
draws heavily on Greek styles, both Classical and Hellenistic. In 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, influenced by early 
art historians like Winckelmann (see The Art Historian's Lens , 
page 157), art connoisseurs exalted Greek Classicism as the height 
of stylistic achievement, and considered Roman art derivative, the 
last chapter, so to speak, of Greek art history. This view changed 
radically in the ensuing years, especially as pure connoisseurship 
(an assessment of quality and authenticity) began to yield to other 
branches of art history. Scholars now focus, for instance, on the 
roles of a work of art in its social and political contexts. Yet 
regardless of how one assesses Roman artists for drawing on 
Greek styles, these were by no means the only styles at play in the 
Roman world. Works of art created in the provinces or for the 
nonelite have their own style, as do those of late antiquity. There 
were also phases of distinct “Egyptianizing” in Rome.

Roman art was the art of both Republic and Empire, the art of 
a small city that became a vast empire. It was created by Roman 
artists, but not exclusively; the greatest architect of Trajans time 
may have been from Damascus. Perhaps the most useful way to 
think of Roman art is to see it as an art of syncretism—an art that 
brings diverse elements together to produce something entirely 
new, with a powerful message-bearing potential. Syncretism was 
a profoundly Roman attitude, and was probably the secret to 
Romes extraordinarily successful expansion. From the very start, 
Roman society was unusually tolerant of non-Roman traditions, 
as long as they did not undermine the state. Romans did not, on 
the whole, subordinate the populations of newly conquered 
regions, eventually according many the rights of citizenship and 
receiving non-Roman gods hospitably in the capital. This Roman 
propensity for integrating other cultures led to a remarkably 
diverse world. 

EARLY ROME AND THE REPUBLIC 

According to Roman legend, Romulus founded the city of Rome 
in 753/52 bce, in the region known as Latium, on a site near the 
Tiber River. The sons of Mars and Rhea Silvia, who later became 
a Vestal Virgin, Romulus and his twin, Remus, were abandoned at 
birth, and raised by a she-wolf (see fig. 6.17). Yet archaeological

evidence shows that people had actually lived on the site since 
about 1000 bce. From the eighth to the sixth centuries bce, a 
series of kings built the first defensive wall around the settlement, 
drained and filled the swampy plain of the Forum, and built a vast 
temple on the Capitoline Hill, making an urban center out of 
what had been little more than a group of villages. The kings 
established many of Romes lasting institutions, such as priest¬ 
hoods and techniques of warfare. In about 509 bce, the Roman 
elite expelled the last king, and gradually established a republic, 
with an unwritten constitution. 

Under the Republic, a group of elected magistrates managed 
the affairs of the growing state. Two consuls headed them, and a 
Senate served as an advisory council. Popular uprisings led to 
greater rights and representation for the nonelite over the next 
200 years. Rome gained most of its territorial empire during the 
course of the republic. First Rome and its allies, the Latin League, 


destroyed the southern Etruscan city of Veil in 396 bce. The 
Gauls, from the north, sacked Rome in 390 bce, but this seems 
only to have spurred Rome on to greater conquest. By 275 bce, 
Rome controlled all of Italy, including the Greek colonies of 
the south. Three Punic (from the Latin for “Phoenician”) Wars 
against the North African city of Carthage ended with the deci¬ 
sive razing of Carthage in 146 bce, and during the second century 
bce all of Greece and Asia Minor also came under Roman control. 
Yet despite its successes, from about 133 bce to 31 bce, the Late 
Republic was in turmoil. Factional politics, mob violence, assassi¬ 
nation, and competition among aristocratic families led to the 
breakdown of the constitution and to civil war. Julius Caesar 
became perpetual dictator in 46 bce, a position that other senators 
were unable to tolerate. Two years later, they assassinated him. 

During the course of the Republic, magistrates commissioned 
works of architecture and sculpture to embellish the city as well

Recognizing Copies: The Case of the Laocoon 


I n one of the most powerful passages of The Aeneid, Vergil describes 
the punishment of Laocoon, who, according to legend, was a priest 
at the time of the Trojan War. He warned the Trojans against accept¬ 
ing the wooden horse, the famous gift that hid invading Greeks within. 
The goddess Minerva, on the side of the Greeks, punished Laocoon by 
sending two giant serpents to devour him and his sons. Vergil 
describes the twin snakes gliding out of the sea to the altar where 
Laocoon was conducting a sacrifice, strangling him in their terrible 
coils, turning sacrificer into sacrificed. (See .) 

In January 1 506, a sculptural group depicting Laocoon and his sons 
writhing in the coils of snakes was unearthed on the Esquiline Hill in 
Rome. Renaissance humanists immediately hailed the group as an 
original Greek sculpture describing this brutal scene. It was, they 
thought, a sculpture that Pliny the Elder praised in his Natural History 
(completed in 77 ce). Pliny believed the Laocoon group that stood in 
Titus’ palace to be the work of three sculptors from Rhodes: 
Hagesandros, Polydorus, and Athenodorus. Within a year of its redis¬ 
covery, the group had become the property of Pope Julius II, who 
installed it in his sculpture gallery, the Belvedere Courtyard in the 
Vatican. The sculpture quickly became a focus for contemporary 
artists, who both used it as a model and struggled to restore 
Laocoon’s missing right arm (now bent behind him in what art 
historians consider the correct position). Its instant fame derived in 
part from the tidy convergence of the rediscovered sculpture with 
ancient literary sources: The masterpiece represented a dramatic 
moment in Rome’s greatest epic and was described by a reputable 
Roman author. 

The Laocoon group caught the rapt attention of the eighteenth- 
century art historian J. J. Winckelmann (see The Art Historian’s Lens, 
page 1 57). He recognized a powerful tension between the subjects’ 
agonizing death throes and a viewer’s pleasure at the work’s extraor¬ 
dinary quality. Such was his admiration that he could only see the 
piece as a Classical work, and dated it to the fourth century bce; any 
later and it would be Hellenistic, a period that he characterized as a 
time of artistic decline. So began a wide debate on not only the date 
of the sculpture, but also its originality. For many scholars, the 
writhing agony of the Trojan priest and his sons bears all the hall¬ 
marks of the Hellenistic baroque style, as seen in the gigantomachy 
(the war between gods and giants) of the Great Altar of Zeus at 
Pergamon (see figs. 5.72 and 5.73). A masterpiece of the Hellenistic 
style, it should accordingly date to the third or second century bce. On 
the other hand, evidence from inscriptions links the three artists 
named by Pliny to sculptors at work in the mid-first century bce, 
making the sculpture considerably later and removing it from the 


apogee of the Hellenistic age. Yet there are cases of artists’ names 
being passed down through several generations, and it is not at all 
clear that the group is in fact the sculpture Pliny admired. 

Pliny specified that Laocoon was sculpted from a single piece of 
marble, and this sculpture is not; even more telling is the fact that a 
slab of Carrara marble—which was not exploited until the reign of 
Augustus (r. 27 bce-1 4 ce)— is incorporated into the altar at the back. 
Is the sculpture then an early imperial work? Or is this much-lauded 
masterpiece a Roman copy of a Hellenistic work? If so, does that 
reduce its status? As if this were not debate enough, one contention 
takes Laocoon out of the realm of antiquity altogether, and identifies 
it instead as a Renaissance work by none other than Michelangelo. 
Evidence cited includes a pen study by the artist depicting a male torso 
resembling Laocoon’s, dating to 1501. At this point, all that can be 
said with certainty about Laocoon is that the tidy picture imagined by 
sixteenth-century admirers has become considerably murkier.

as to enhance their own careers. Roman conquests abroad 
brought new artistic forms to the city, especially from Greece, 
which merged with Italic (i.e., typical of people of the Italian 
peninsula) forms to create a Roman artistic vocabulary, and the 
development of new building technologies such as concrete 
strongly influenced architectural designs. 


NEW DIRECTIONS IN ARCHITECTURE 

Roman architecture has had a more lasting impact on Western 
building through the ages than any other ancient tradition. It is an 
architecture of power, mediated through the solidity of its forms, 
and through the experience of those forms. Roman builders were 


CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 183 


STORI AN ’ 













indebted to Greek traditions, especially in their use of the Doric, 
Ionic, and Corinthian styles, yet these traditions inspired build¬ 
ings that were decidedly Roman. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMS The Temple of Jupiter 
Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was the first truly mon¬ 
umental building of Rome (fig. 7.1). Romans worshiped a wide 
range of gods, some of them indigenous, but many others adopted 
from other cultures; in fact, their pantheon of state gods was 
roughly equivalent to the Greek pantheon. The Capitoline temple 
honored the chief god, Jupiter, roughly equivalent to the Greek 
Zeus. Its construction began under two sixth-century bce kings, 
Tarquinius the Ancient and Tarquinius the Proud, but it was one 
of Romes first consuls who actually dedicated the finished tem¬ 
ple. Its scale was unprecedented on the Italian peninsula, evoking 
the massive Ionic temples of eastern Greece (see fig. 5.12). It stood 
on a high masonry platform, with steps leading up to the facade. 
Six wooden columns marked the front, and six columns flanked 
each side. Two rows of columns supported the roof over a deep 
porch. An Etruscan artist, Vulca of Veii, crafted a vast terra-cotta 
acroterion for the peak of the pediment, representing Jupiter in a 
four-horse chariot. A triple cella with walls of wood-framed mud 
brick accommodated cult statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, 
and recent excavations suggest that two additional rooms were 
arranged across the rear, accessed from the lateral colonnades. The 
rectilinear forms, the use of columns, and a gabled roof echo 
Greek design; yet the high podium and the emphatic frontal

access set it apart. Scholars call these features Etrusco-Italic, and 
they characterize most Roman temples in centuries to come. 

Although the practice of borrowing Greek forms began early 
in the Republic, it was particularly marked during the period of 
Romes conquest of Greece, when architects used Greek building 
materials as well as essential building forms. After celebrating a 
triumph over Macedonia in 146 bce, the general Metellus com¬ 
missioned Romes first all-marble temple and hired a Greek archi¬ 
tect, Hermodorus, for the job. It no longer survives, but was 
probably close in form to the remarkably well-preserved temple 
to the harbor-god Portunus near the Tiber (fig. 7.2). Dating from 
80 to 70 bce, the temple is in the Italic style: It stands on a 
podium, and engaged lateral columns (instead of a true peristyle) 


emphasize the frontal approach. All the same, the Ionic columns 
have the slender proportions of Classical Greek temples, and a 
white marble stucco covering their travertine and tufa shafts, 
bases, and capitals deliberately evoked the translucent marbles of 
Greek architecture. 

Roman architects quickly combined the rectilinear designs of 
Greek architecture with the curved form of the arch (fig. 7.3). An 
arch could be a free-standing monument in its own right, or be 
applied to a building, often to frame an entrance. To construct 
arches, builders assembled wedge-shaped voussoirs, as seen in the 
Etruscan Porta Marzia at Perugia (see fig. 6.12). These arches are 
extremely strong, in contrast to corbeled arches (see fig. 4.21).

CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 185 






















































































Eastern architects used them in ziggurat foundations and in city 
gates, and Egyptian builders employed them, as well as their 
extension, the barrel vault, as early as about 1250 bce, mainly in 
underground tombs and utilitarian buildings, rather than for 
monumental public buildings; Greeks architects constructed 
underground structures or simple gateways with arches. The 
Romans, however, put them to widespread use in public architec¬ 
ture, making them one of the hallmarks of Roman building. 

THE CONCRETE REVOLUTION It was the development of 
concrete, however, that was a catalyst for the most dramatic 
changes in Roman architecture. Concrete is a mixture of mortar 
and pieces of aggregate such as tufa, limestone, or brick. At first, 
Roman architects used it as fill, between walls or in podiums. Yet 
on adding pozzolana sand to the mortar, they discovered a mate¬ 
rial of remarkable durability—which would even cure (or set) 
under water—and they used it with growing confidence from the 
second century bce onward. Despite its strength, it was not 
attractive to the eye, and builders concealed it with cosmetic fac¬ 
ings of stone, brick, and plaster, which changed with the passing 
years and therefore provide archaeologists with an invaluable tool 
for dating Roman buildings. The advantages of concrete were 
quickly evident: It was strong and inexpensive, and could be 
worked by relatively unskilled laborers. It was also extraordinar¬ 
ily adaptable. By constructing wooden frameworks into which 
they poured the concrete, builders could mold it to shapes that 
would have been impossible or prohibitively time-consuming to 
make using cut stone, wood, or mud brick. In terms of design, the 
history of Roman architecture is a dialogue between the tradi¬ 
tional rectilinear forms of Greek and early Italic post-and-lintel 
traditions (construction using vertical posts to support horizontal 
elements) on the one hand, and the freedoms afforded by this 
malleable material on the other. 

Two quite different Republican structures demonstrate con¬ 
crete s advantages. A building of the second century bce, long 
identified as the Porticus Aemilia, but almost certainly the 
Navalia, or ship shed for the Roman fleet, is the earliest known 
building in Rome constructed entirely of concrete. Its dimensions 
were simply staggering: It stretched 1,600 Roman feet (a little 
shorter than modern feet) along the Tiber and was 300 feet deep. 
As the partial reconstruction in figure 7.4 illustrates, the architects 
took advantage of the new material to create a remarkably open 
interior space. Soaring barrel vaults roofed 50 transverse corri¬ 
dors, built in four rising sections to accommodate the sloping 
terrain. Arches pierced the walls supporting the vaults, so that air 
could circulate freely. Roman sailors could pull the ships into 
these spaces for easy maintenance in the winter months. 

East of Rome, in the Apennine foothills, the town of 
Palestrina (ancient Praeneste) is home to another masterpiece of 
concrete construction (figs. 7.5 and 7.6). The spectacular sanctu¬ 
ary to the goddess Fortuna Primigenia, dated to the late second 
century bce, was an oracular center where priests interpreted 
divine will by drawing lots. Architects used concrete to mold 
structures over the entire surface of the hillside and to craft spaces 



that controlled and heightened a visitor s experience. The sanctu¬ 
ary ascended in seven levels. At the bottom stood an early temple, 
a basilica (see page 225), and a senate house. The upper terraces 
rose in a grand crescendo around a central axis, established by a 
series of statue niches and staircases. A visitor climbed lateral 
staircases to the third terrace, where steep ramps, roofed with 
sloping barrel vaults, led upward. A bright shaft of daylight beck¬ 
oned from the end of the ramp, where an open landing provided 
the first of several stunning views across the countryside. 

On the fourth level, colonnaded exedrae (semicircular recesses) 
framed the altars. Barrel vaults roofed the colonnades, inscribing a 
half-circle both horizontally and vertically (annular barrel vaults). 
Their curved forms animate the straight lines, since columns set in 
a semicircle shift their relationship to the environment with every 
step a visitor takes. A wide central staircase leads upward to the 
next level. After the confinement of the ramps, its steps were 
exposed, engendering a sense of vulnerability in the visitor. On this 
level, shops probably sold souvenirs and votive objects. Standing 
on this terrace, a visitor was directly above the voids of the barrel 
vaults below, evidence of the architects’ confidence in the struc¬ 
ture. The next terrace was a huge open court, with double colon¬ 
nades on three sides. The visitor climbed to a small theater topped 
by a double annular colonnade. Here religious performances took 
place against the magnificent backdrop of the countryside 
beyond, and in full sight of Fortuna, the goddess whose circular 
temple crowned the complex. Its diminutive size drew grandeur 
from the vast scale of the whole—all accomplished with concrete. 
The hugely versatile material plays easily with the landscape, 
transforming nature to heighten a visitor s religious experience. 

The first century bce was a turning point in the use of archi¬ 
tecture for political purposes. One of the most magnificent build¬ 
ings of this time was the vast theater complex of Pompey, which 
would remain Romes most important theater throughout antiquity.

Primigenia, Praeneste 



Like Julius Caesar after him, Pompey (active in Roman politics in 
the 70s and 60s bce) maneuvered his way into a position of sole 
authority in Rome and used architecture to express and justify his 
aconstitutional power. To commemorate his conquests, he con¬ 
ceived of a theater on the Field of Mars, just outside the northern 
city boundary, dedicated to his patron goddess Venus Victrix (the 
Conqueror) (fig. 7.7). Later buildings on the site incorporate 
traces of its superstructure, and the street plan still reflects its 
curved form. Moreover, its ground plan is inscribed on an ancient 
marble map of the city, carved in the early third century ce, and 
new excavations may uncover more of its vaulted substructure. 
The reconstruction in figure 7.7 is therefore provisional, a combi¬ 
nation of archaeological evidence and conjecture; it is likely to 
change as new evidence emerges. In some respects, Pompey s 
theater resembled its Greek forebears, with sloping banks of seats 
in a semicircular arrangement, a ground-level orchestra area, and 


a raised stage for scenery. In other ways, however, it was radically 
different. It was not, for instance, nestled into a preexisting hill¬ 
side. Instead, the architect created an artificial slope out of con¬ 
crete, rising on radially disposed barrel vaults, which buttressed 
one another for a strong structure. Concrete, in other words, gave 
the designer freedom to build independent of the landscape. The 
curved cavea (seating area), moreover, was a true half-circle, rather 
than the extended half-circle of Greek theaters. At the summit of 
the cavea were three shrines and a temple dedicated to Venus. The 
curved facade held statues personifying the nations Pompey had 
subdued. Beyond the theater, and adjoining it behind the stage 
building, porticoes defined a vast garden, where Romans could 
admire valuable works of art, such as sculptures, paintings, and 
tapestries, many of which had been brought from Greece. These 
public gardens were Pompey s gift to the people of Rome—an 
implicit way of winning political favor. 


CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 187 
























7.7 Theater complex of Pompey, Rome. Dedicated in 55 bce. Provisional reconstruction by James E. Packer and John Burge 


Pompey s theater complex dwarfed the smaller, scattered 
buildings that individual magistrates had commissioned up to that 
point. It was also Romes first permanent theater. As in Greece, 
plays were an essential component of religious ceremonies, and 
Romans had always constructed the buildings that accommo¬ 
dated them out of wood, assembling them for the occasion and 
then dismantling them. In fact, some elite Romans spoke out 
against the construction of permanent theaters—ostensibly on 
moral grounds, but also because they were places for the nonelite 
to meet. Pompey circumvented such objections by describing his 
theater as a mere appendage to the temple of Venus at its summit, 
and in building the complex he set the precedent for the great 
forum project of Julius Caesar, and the imperial fora that would 
follow (see page 196). 

Sculpture 

FREE-STANDING SCULPTURE In early Rome, as elsewhere 
in Italy, sculptors worked primarily in terra cotta and in bronze. 
Countless terra-cotta votive objects survive from sanctuaries, 
where visitors dedicated them in hope of divine favor. The grad¬ 
ual conquest of Greece in the second century bce had led to a 
fascination with Greek works of art, which flooded into Rome as 
booty. So intense was the fascination, in fact, that in the late first 
century bce, the poet Horace commented ironically “Greece, 
having been conquered, conquered her wild conqueror, and 
brought the arts into rustic Latium. ” Paraded through the streets 


of Rome as part of the triumphal procession, the works of art 
ended their journey by decorating public spaces, such as the 
theater complex of Pompey (see fig. 7.7). 

These glistening bronze and marble works provoked reaction. 
For most, it seems, they were a welcome sign of Romes cultural 
advance, more visually pleasing than indigenous sculptures in 
terra cotta. Elite Romans assembled magnificent collections of 
Greek art in their homes; through their display they could give 
visual expression to their erudition. The Villa of the Papyri in 
Herculaneum, a city built on the slopes of Vesuvius in southwest 
Italy preserved an extensive collection in situ when the volcano 
erupted. The villa and its collection are partially reconstructed in 
the Getty Museum in Malibu, California. When Greek originals 
were not available, copyists provided alternatives in the styles of 
known Greek artists. (See Materials and Techniques , page 193, and 
The Art Historian's Lens , page 183.) A series of letters from 
Cicero, a lawyer and writer of the mid-first century bce, to his 
friend Atticus in Athens shows the process at work: he asks 
Atticus to send him sculptures to decorate the various parts of his 
villa. (See Primary Source, page 192.) The stylistic borrowings also 
had a bold political dimension, showing that Rome had bested the 
great cultures of Greece. 

RELIEF SCULPTURE A few strident voices spoke out against 
the invasion of Greek art. Most vociferous was Cato (“The 
Moralist”), for whom traditional Roman art forms symbolized 
the staunch moral and religious values that had led to, and justified,

7.8 Reconstruction of pedimental 
sculptures from Via di San Gregorio, 
ca. 150-100 bce 



Romes political ascent. A set of magnificent terra-cotta pediment 
sculptures discovered on Via di San Gregorio in Rome during 
sewer repairs in 1878 gives an impression of the art form he was 
intent on defending (figs. 7.8 and 7.9). The subject of the pediment 
appears to be a suovetaurilia , a sacrifice of a pig, a sheep, and a 
bull. The larger-scale figures probably represent divinities—per¬ 
haps Mars in the center, with breastplate and spear, and two flank¬ 
ing goddesses. Smaller figures include a male in a toga, perhaps the 
presiding magistrate; a male in tunic and mantle; and several victi- 
marii (attendants to the sacrificial animals). The artists sculpted 
the figures in such high relief that they are almost fully in the 
round, and applied them to a smooth background, painted black; 
they protrude emphatically toward the top, in order to be legible 
from below. As in Egypt, color conventions distinguish the female 
figures, with their cream skin tones, from the deeper red males. 

The pediment may have belonged to a temple to Mars on the 
Caelian Hill. Scholars date it to the third quarter of the second 
century bce, which places it at the height of Greek influence in 
Rome. This is clearly evident in Mars’ Hellenistic breastplate, the 
classicizing treatment of the drapery and faces, and the muscula¬ 
ture. All the same, the material and technique are distinctly Italic, 
and the refined modeling and high polish demonstrate how 
striking terra-cotta works could be. 

Sometimes Roman sculpture commemorated specific events, 
as it did in the ancient Near East (see figs. 2.12 and 2.19). Classical 
Greek sculptors disguised historical events in mythical clothing— 
a combat of Lapiths and Centaurs, for instance, or Greeks and 
Amazons (see figs. 5.35, and 5.44)—and this convention broke 
down only slightly in the Classical period. The Romans, by con¬ 
trast, represented actual events, developing a form of sculpture 
known as historical relief—although many were not historically 
accurate. The reliefs shown in figure 7.10, sometimes called the

Base of Marcus Antonius, probably decorated a base for a statu¬ 
ary group, which scholars place near the route used for triumphal 
processions through Rome. One long section shows a census, a 
ceremony during which individuals recorded their property hold¬ 
ings with the state to qualify for military service (which was a pre¬ 
requisite for public office). On the left side, soldiers and civilians 
line up to be entered into the census. Two large figures flanking an 
altar represent a statue of Mars, god of war, and the officiating 
censor, who probably commissioned the monument. Attendants 
escort a bull, a sheep, and a pig for sacrifice at an altar, marking 
the closing ceremony of the census. 

On the same monument, the remaining reliefs depict a marine 
thiasos (procession) for the marriage of the sea-god Neptune and 
a sea-nymph, Amphitrite. But these reliefs are in an entirely dif¬ 
ferent style. The swirling motion of the marriage procession and 
its Hellenistic forms contrast dramatically with the static compo¬ 
sition of the census relief and the stocky proportions of its figures. 
Moreover, the panels are carved from different types of marble. 
Scholars suppose that the sea-thiasos sections were not original to 
this context, but that a triumphant general brought them back as 


spoils from Greece to grace a triumphal monument—proof, as it 
were, of his conquest. By contrast, artists carved the census relief 
in Rome to complement the thiasos. Together, the reliefs may rep¬ 
resent the patron s military and political achievements. 

PORTRAIT SCULPTURE Literary sources reveal that the 
Senate and People (the governing bodies of the Republic) of 
Rome honored political or military figures by putting their stat¬ 
ues on public display, often in the Roman Forum, the civic heart 
of the city (see page 196). The custom began in the early Republic 
and continued until the end of the Empire. Many of the early por¬ 
traits were bronze and were melted down in later years for 
coinage or weaponry. A magnificent bronze male head dating to 
the late first century bce, a mere fragment of a full-length figure, 
gives a tantalizing sense of how these statues once looked (fig. 
7.11). Sixteenth-century antiquarians dubbed it “Brutus,” after 
the founder and first consul of the Republic. Strong features 
characterize the over-life-size portrait: a solid neck, a square jaw 
accentuated by a short beard, high cheekbones, and a firm brow. 
The image derives its power not from classical idealization or the

Cicero (106-43 bce) 



Letters to Atticus I. 9-10 (67 bce, Rome) 

Marcus Tullius Cicero was a leading politician and orator in Rome 
during the turbulent days of the late Republic. He is known through his 
extensive writings, which include orations, rhetorical and philosophical 
treatises, and letters. Like many other Roman statesmen, he filed his 
many houses and villas with works of Greek art, either original or 
copied. Atticus was his childhood friend, who maintained communica¬ 
tion with Cicero afer moving to Athens and served as his purchasing 
agent for works of art. 

IX 

Cicero to Atticus, Greeting 

Y our letters are much too few and far between, considering that 
it is much easier for you to find someone coming to Rome than 
for me to find anyone going to Athens. Besides, you can be surer that 


I am at Rome than I can be that you are in Athens. The shortness of 
this letter is due to my doubts as to your whereabouts. Not knowing 
for certain where you are, I don’t want private correspondence to fall 
into a stranger’s hands. 

I am awaiting impatiently the statues of Megaric marble and those 
of Hermes, which you mentioned in your letter. Don’t hesitate to 
send anything else of the same kind that you have, if it is fit for my 
Academy. My purse is long enough. This is my little weakness; and 
what I want especially are those that are fit for a Gymnasium. 
Lentulus promises his ships. Please bestir yourself about it. Thyillus 
asks you, or rather has got me to ask you, for some books on the 
ritual of the Eumolpidae.

stylized qualities of, for instance, the portrait of an Akkadian 
ruler (see fig. 2.11), but from the creases and furrows that record 
a life of engagement. The slight downward turn of the head may 
indicate that it once belonged to an equestrian portrait, originally 
displayed raised above a viewer. 

The majority of Republican portraits were stone and date to 
the end of the second century and the first century bce. Most rep¬ 
resent men at an advanced age (fig. 7.12). Wrinkles cover their faces, 
etching deep crags into their cheeks and brows. Artists played up 
distinguishing marks—like warts, a hooked nose, or a receding 
hairline—rather than smoothing over them. In the example illus¬ 
trated here, remnants of a veil suggest that the subject was repre¬ 
sented as a priest. Although there is no way of knowing what the 
sitter looked like, the images appear realistic, so that scholars term 
the style veristic, from the Latin verus , meaning “true. ” Cultures 
construct different ideals, and to Romans, responsibility and 
experience came with seniority. Military service was a prerequisite 
for office, and most magistracies had minimum-age requirements. 
An image marked by age therefore conveyed the necessary quali¬ 
ties for winning votes for political office, and the veristic style 
became the hallmark of Late Republican portraiture. 

Where the impetus to produce likenesses came from is a 
mystery that scholars have struggled to solve. For some, its roots 
lie in an Italic practice of storing ancestral masks in the home to 
provide a visual genealogy—in this society, a good pedigree was a 
reliable steppingstone to political success. Polybius, a Greek 
historian of the mid-second century bce, recounts that before 
burying a family member, living relatives would wear these ances¬ 
tral masks in a funerary procession, parading the family’s history 
in front of bystanders. (See Primary Source , page 194.) Other 
scholars trace it to a Greek custom of placing votive statues of 
athletes and other important individuals in sacred precincts, and 
indeed some Roman portraits were executed in Greek styles.

Copying Greek Sculptures 


I n order to satisfy a growing demand for Greek sculptures, artists set 
up copying workshops in Athens and Rome, where they produced 
copies of famous “masterpieces.” Some of these copies may have been 
relatively close replicas of the originals; others were adaptations, 
where the copyist’s own creativity came freely into play. Given the 
paucity of surviving Greek originals, it is often difficult for scholars to 
determine the appearance of the original, and thus to distinguish 
replica from adaptation. One clue to recognizing a marble copy 
(whether a true replica or a free adaptation) of a bronze original is to 
look for the use of struts to strengthen the stone, since marble has a 
different tensile strength from bronze (see the tree trunk and the strut 
at the hip in fig. 5.33). 

Scholars have long believed that Roman copyists used a pointing 
machine (a duplicating device that takes one to one measurements), 
similar to a kind that was used in the early nineteenth century, but 
evidence from unfinished sculptures now suggests a different tech¬ 
nique using calipers, known as triangulation. By establishing three 
points on the model, and the same three points on a new block of 
stone, an artist can calculate and transfer any other point on the model 
sculpture to a new place on the copy. The sculptor takes measure¬ 
ments from each of the three points on the original to a fourth new 
point, and, using those measurements, makes arcs with the calipers 
from each of the three points on the new block of stone. Where the 


arcs intersect is the fourth point (see fig. 4) on the copy. In order to 
alter the scale from original to copy, the artist simply multiplies or 
divides the measurements. Having taken a number of points in this 
way, the sculptor uses a chisel to cut away the stone between the 
points. The accuracy of the resultant copy depends upon how many 
points the sculptor takes. 



The triangulation process 


Aspiring politicians probably commissioned many of these 
Republican portraits, but scholars can rarely give a name to the 
individuals portrayed. Inscriptions identifying the subject are 
scarce, and the coin portraits that help to identify later public fig¬ 
ures only appear from the mid-first century bce on. By contrast, 
we can readily identify individuals represented in a related class of 
monument. In the Late Republican and Augustan periods, eman¬ 
cipated slaves commissioned group portraits in relief, which they 
mounted on roadside funerary monuments (fig. 7.13). Usually, a 


long rectangular frame surrounds shoulder-length truncated busts 
of the subjects. The very fact that the ex-slaves are depicted visu¬ 
ally reflects their freed status; other visual cues reinforce it, such 
as a ring, either painted or carved on a mans hand, or the joined 
right hands of a man and woman, symbolizing marriage, which 
was not legal among slaves. An inscription records their names 
and status. In this example, the freed slaves' one-time owner 
appears in the center of the relief.

Polybius (ca. 200-ca. 118 bce) 



Histories, from Book YI 

Polybius was a Greek historian active during the Roman conquest of his 
homeland. His Histories recount the rise of Rome from the third 
century BCE to the destruction of Corinth in 146 BCE. In Book VI he 
considers cultural and other factors explaining Rome 5 success. 



W henever any illustrious man dies ... they place the image of the 
departed in the most conspicuous position in the house, 
enclosed in a wooden shrine. This image is a mask reproducing with 
remarkable fidelity both the features and complexion of the deceased. 
On the occasion of public sacrifices they display these images, and 
decorate them with much care, and when any distinguished member 
of the family dies they take them to the funeral, putting them on men 
who seem to them to bear the closest resemblance to the original in 


stature and carriage. These representatives wear togas, with a purple 
border if the deceased was a consul or praetor, whole purple if he was 
a censor, and embroidered with gold if he had celebrated a triumph or 
achieved anything similar. They all ride in chariots preceded by the 
fasces, axes, and other insignia ... and when they arrive at the rostra 
they all seat themselves in a row on ivory chairs. There could not 
easily be a more ennobling spectacle for a young man who aspires 
to fame and virtue. For who would not be inspired by the sight of 
the images of men renowned for their excellence, all together and as 
if alive and breathing? ... By this means, by this constant renewal of 
the good report of brave men, the celebrity of those who performed 
noble deeds is rendered immortal.... But the most important result 
is that young men are thus inspired to endure every suffering for 
the public welfare in the hope of winning the glory that attends on 
brave men.

Painting and Mosaic 

Lamentably few free-standing portraits come from known archaeo¬ 
logical contexts. Romans appear to have displayed them in tombs 
as well as in homes and public places. Tombs were more than just 
lodging places for the dead. They were the focus of routine funer¬ 
ary rituals, and during the course of the Republic they became 
stages for displaying the feats of ancestors in order to elevate fam¬ 
ily status. Paintings, both inside and out, served this purpose well. 

A tomb on the Esquiline Hill in Rome yielded a fragmentary 
painting of the late fourth or early third century bce, depicting 
scenes from a conflict between the Romans and a neighboring 
tribe, the Samnites (fig. 7.14). A label identifies a toga-clad figure 
on the upper right as Quintus Fabius, a renowned general who 
may have been the tomb s owner. He holds out a spear to a figure 
identified as Fannius on the left, who wears golden greaves and 
loincloth. Behind Fannius is a crenelated city wall, and in the 
lower registers are scenes of battle and parlay. The labels suggest 
that the images record specific events, relating the subject matter 
to the relief sculptures discussed previously. Literary sources state 
that Roman generals also made a practice of commissioning panel 
paintings of their military achievements, which they displayed in 
triumphal processions before installing them in a public building 
such as a temple. 

As well as ornamenting walls with narrative paintings, Roman 
artists also decorated floors with mosaics. They fitted together 
minute colored stones called tesserae to create a pattern or a fig¬ 
ured image. An extraordinary example survives from an apsidal 
room opening onto the forum at Praeneste (Palestrina) (fig. 7.15; 
see figs. 7.5 and 7.6), probably dating to the end of the second 
century bce. The mosaic is a large visual map of Egypt, perhaps 
inspired by an Alexandrian work. The Nile dominates. In the 
foreground is Alexandria, with its monumental buildings, lush 
vegetation, and cosmopolitan lifestyle. A vignette at the lower 
right may show a Roman general s visit to Egypt. The mosaicist

Remarkable for its fine execution and the richness of its colors, 
the mosaic is a testament to a fascination with far-off lands during 
a phase of Romes rapid expansion. 

THE EARLY EMPIRE 

The last century of the Republic witnessed a gradual breakdown 
of order in Rome, as ambitious men vied for sole authority in the 
city. Julius Caesar s assassination on the Ides of March of 44 bce 
was a last-ditch effort to safeguard the constitution. His heir, 
Octavian, took revenge on the principal assassins, Brutus and 
Cassius, and then eliminated his own rival for power, Mark 


Antony, who had made an alliance with the Egyptian queen 
Cleopatra. In 27 bce, the Senate named Octavian as Augustus 
Caesar, and he became princeps , or first citizen. History recog¬ 
nizes him as the first Roman emperor. The arts flourished in the 
Augustan age. Artists took a new interest in classicism, while 
Virgil penned The Aeneid as a Latin response to Homers epics, 
and Horace and Ovid wrote poetry of lasting renown. 

The birth of the Roman Empire brought a period of greater 
stability to the Mediterranean region than had previously been 
known. Roman domination continued to spread, and at its largest 
extent, in the time of Trajan (98-117 ce), the Empire stretched 
through most of Europe, as far north as northern England, 
through much of the Middle East including Armenia and Assyria, 
and throughout coastal North Africa. Romanization spread 
through these regions. Roman institutions—political, social, and 
religious—mingled with indigenous ones, leading to a degree of 


CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 195 
















homogenization through much of the Roman world. Increasingly, 
the emperor and his family became the principal patrons of pub¬ 
lic art and architecture in Rome. Often, their public monuments 
stressed the legitimacy of the imperial family. 

Architecture 

THE IMPERIAL FORA During the Republic, the Roman 
Forum was the bustling center of civic life (figs. 7.16 and 7.17). It 
was there, in markets and basilicas, that people shopped and 
attended court cases and schools. The Senate deliberated in the 
Forums Senate House, and temples to the state gods housed cult 
statues as well as the state treasury. Gladiators fought in the open 
space in the center of the Forum, where temporary wooden 
bleachers were erected for spectators. The Forum continued to 
accommodate many essential Roman functions during the 
Empire, but some moved to new imperial complexes. Pompey’s 
theater complex was the first of a series of huge urban interven¬ 
tions through which Romes autocrats curried favor with the pop¬ 
ulace. Julius Caesar and Augustus each commissioned a forum, 
separate from but close to the Roman Forum, establishing a tra¬ 
dition that Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan followed. As the plan 
in figure 7.17 reveals, these fora were closely connected to each 
other topographically and drew significance from their proximity. 
A visitor entered the Forum of Augustus directly from that of his 
divinized ancestor Caesar, cementing the connection through 
physical experience. Augustus’ Forum was a large open plaza 


with porticoes lining the long sides. At the end of the plaza was a 
temple to Mars the Avenger, which Augustus had vowed to erect 
after Caesar’s assassination. When compared with the free forms 
of the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Praeneste, this complex 
is overwhelmingly rectilinear and Classically inspired, as was 
most Augustan architecture. This deliberate choice evoked the 
pinnacle of Greek achievement in fifth-century bce Athens, and 
the pervasive use of marble, available from newly opened quarries 
at Carrara, underlined the effect. Sculpture filled the Forum. The 
porticoes housed full-length, labeled portraits of great men from 
Romes legendary past and recent history, suggesting a link between 
the past and the Augustan present. In the attic (upper level) of the 
porticoes, engaged caryatids (supporting columns in the shape of 
draped female figures) flanked shields decorated with heads of 
Jupiter Ammon (god of the Sahara, sometimes described as 
Alexander the Great’s father). The carved women replicated the 
figures on the south porch of the Erechtheion on the Athenian 
Akropolis (see fig. 5.51), where Augustus’ architects were engaged 
in restoration work. Many of the rituals once accommodated by 
Rome’s historic buildings such as the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter 
now moved to Augustus’ Forum, and by diverting these state 
activities to an arena associated with his name, Augustus placed 
himself explicitly at the head of Roman public life. 

The largest of all the imperial fora was Trajan’s, financed with 
the spoils of his wars against the Dacians. Reconstructions of the 
complex give a sense of its former magnificence (fig. 7.18). 
Located alongside Augustus’ Forum, it adapted many of that

forum s features to new effect. In place of the caryatids in the por¬ 
tico attics, for instance, were statues of captive Dacians carved 
from exotic marbles. Beyond a basilica at the far end, two libraries 
and a temple defined a small courtyard, where Trajans Column 
stood (see figs. 7.39 and 7.40). The Forums message is clear: The 
Dacian Wars brought Rome great financial benefit. As in many 
societies, the ruling elite hoped to dispel the starker realities of 
war through visual propaganda. 

The change in patronage from magistrates to emperor is one 
of the major developments in architecture during the Empire. 
Another is the invention of the composite capital. To the 
building styles that they borrowed from Greece, Roman archi¬ 
tects added two more (fig. 7.19). One was the Tuscan style, 
which resembled the Doric style except that the shaft stood 
on a base. This style was in use throughout the Roman period. 
The composite capital was an imperial phenomenon: Architects 
used it as a substitute for the Ionic capital on secular buildings, 
especially from the reign of the first Flavian emperor, Vespasian 
(69-79 ce). It combined the volutes of an Ionic capital with the 
acanthus leaves of the Corinthian capital, to rich decorative 
effect. 


THE COLOSSEUM Tuscan columns frequently appear in a dec¬ 
orative capacity on entertainment buildings. Vespasian was the 
first to construct a permanent amphitheater for the gladiatorial 
games and mock sea battles that were so central to Roman enter¬ 
tainment and to Romes penal system (figs. 7.20, 7.21, and 7.22). 
Putting on shows for the populace was a crucial form of favor- 
gaining benefaction, and the audience assembled for diversion but 
also to see their emperor and to receive the free handouts that he 
would make on these occasions. Vespasian died before completing 
the Colosseum, and his son Titus inaugurated it in 80 ce with over 
100 days of games, at a cost of over 9,000 animal lives. 

In terms of sheer mass, the Colosseum was one of the largest 
single buildings anywhere: It stood 159 feet high, 616 feet 9 inches 
long, and 511 feet 11 inches wide, and held well over 50,000 spec¬ 
tators. Concrete—faced with travertine—was the secret of its suc¬ 
cess. In plan, 80 radial barrel-vaulted wedges ringed an oval arena. 
Each barrel vault buttressed the next, making the ring remarkably 
stable (see fig. 7.22). The wedges sloped down from the outside to 
the ringside to support seating, as in Pompey s theater, and the 
architects accommodated countless stairways and corridors 
within the wedges to ensure the smooth flow of traffic between 
the entrances and the seating areas and the arena. During the per¬ 
formances, Romans took their seats strictly according to social 
rank, and the distinctive clothing of each order visually set off one

group from another. On the hottest days, sailors stationed nearby 
rigged a velarium , huge canvas sheets, over the seating areas to 
provide shade. Dignified and monumental, the exterior reflects 
the structure s interior organization. Eighty arched entrances led 
into the building, framed with engaged Tuscan columns. On the 
second story, Ionic columns framed a second set of arches, and on 
the third are engaged Corinthian columns. Engaged Corinthian 
pilasters embellish the wall on the fourth. 

THE PANTHEON But of all the masterpieces Roman architects 
accomplished with concrete, the Pantheon is perhaps the most 
remarkable (fig. 7.23). Augustus’ right-hand man, Agrippa, built 
the first Pantheon on the site. Its name suggests that he intended 
it as a temple to all the gods. This was a Hellenistic concept, and 
it included living and deceased members of the ruling family 
among the gods. When a fire destroyed this temple in 80 ce, 
Domitian built a reconstruction, which perished after a lightning 
strike. The Pantheon we see today, which has a substantially dif¬ 
ferent design, is probably the work of Trajan’s architect, perhaps 
Apollodorus. The temple was completed in Hadrian’s reign, and 
as an act of piety, Hadrian left Agrippa’s name in the inscription 
(see The Art Historian's Lens , page 202). It owes its status as one 
of the best-preserved temples of Rome to its transformation into 
a church in the early seventh century ce. All the same, its sur¬ 
roundings have changed sufficiently through the ages to alter a 
visitor’s experience of it quite profoundly.

THE ANCIENT WORLD 















































In Roman times, the Pantheon stood, raised on a podium, at 
the south end of a large rectangular court (fig. 7.24). Porticoes 
framed the three remaining sides of the court and extended on the 
south up to the sides of the temple s pedimented porch, hiding the 
temple s circular drum from view. A visitor approaching the tem¬ 
ple s broad octastyle facade would have been struck by the forest 
of massive monolithic gray and pink granite columns soaring 
upward; but in most other respects, the temple s form would have 
been familiar, evoking an expectation of a rectangular cella 
beyond the huge bronze doors, and a large cult statue. Yet a sur¬ 
prise was in store. On stepping across the threshold (figs. 7.25 and 
7.26), a visitor faced a vast circular hall, with seven large niches at 


ground level at the cardinal points. Engaged pilasters and bronze 
grilles decorated an attic level, and high above soared an enor¬ 
mous dome, pierced with a 27-foot hole, or oculus, open to the 
sky. Through the oculus came a glowing shaft of light, slicing 
through the shadows from high overhead. Dome and drum are of 
equal height, and the total interior height, 143 feet, is also the 
dome s diameter (fig. 7.27). For many ancient viewers, the result¬ 
ant sphere would have symbolized eternity and perfection, and 
the dome s surface, once emblazoned with bronze rosettes in its 
coffers (recessed panels), must have evoked a starry night sky. 

For a visitor entering the cella, there was no obvious cue to 
point out where to go, except toward the light at the center. In

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 


Two Pantheon Problems 


to 


to 


U ntil the early twentieth century, most scholars believed that the 
existing Pantheon was an Augustan building, partially because its 
inscription attributes it to Agrippa, Augustus’ right-hand man. In 
1 936-38, archaeologist Herbert Bloch produced a masterly analysis of 
Roman brick-stamps—stamps that manufacturers impressed on bricks 
while they were wet. Often, these incorporated the names of consuls, 
especially in the second century ce, which allows scholars to date 
bricks to a span of years, and sometimes even to a precise year. 
Bloch’s assessment of bricks used in the Pantheon led him to confirm 
what archaeologists had begun to suspect on the basis of excavations: 
that the Pantheon was not Agrippa’s temple but a later rebuilding of 
it. Bloch assigned it to the reign of Hadrian. However, Lise Hetland’s 
new reading of the Pantheon brick-stamps stresses the presence of 
Trajanic bricks in early stages of the temple’s construction. This sug¬ 
gests that building began in Trajan’s reign, and ended under Hadrian. 
The Pantheon may be the work of Apollodorus, designer of Trajan’s 
Forum, who also constructed an imperial bath building with similar 
design features. If true, as many believe, this redating will engender 
new interpretations of the building’s significance and new assess¬ 
ments of the emperors’ respective building programs. 

Since the fifteenth century, architects studying the Pantheon have 
struggled with a paradox: Despite the building’s profound impact on 
Western architecture from the moment of its construction, irregular¬ 


ities in its design suggest that it is seriously flawed. These irregular¬ 
ities include an inexplicable second pediment, above and behind the 
first; the fact that the exterior cornices are at different levels on 
circular drum and porch; and unaccountable misalignments in the 
floor plan. To explain these irregularities, scholars initially concluded 
that the present building is the result of several different building 
campaigns—a theory that Bloch’s brick analysis roundly disproved. 

In 1 987, while doodling on a napkin over a beer at a pub, three 
British scholars, Paul Davies, David Hemsoll and Mark Wilson Jones, 
recognized that if the 40-foot column shafts of the Pantheon’s porch 
were replaced with 50-foot shafts, the irregularities would disappear. 
The taller shafts would raise the pediment to the level of the “ghost” 
pediment; the cornices would align around the entire building; and 
because the shafts would be thicker, the imperfections in the floor 
plan would be resolved. Gray and pink granite shafts come from 
Aswan in Egypt. Fifty-foot shafts are relatively rare; in the event that 
they were—for instance—lost at sea, 40-foot replacements would have 
been more readily available to keep construction on schedule. The 
British scholars’ contention—which is now widely accepted—is that an 
unforeseen circumstance forced the builders to deviate from the 
design mid-construction. One of the most admired buildings of antiq¬ 
uity, in other words, is probably a brilliant compromise between 
design and necessity. 


fact, the domes coffers only make sense perspectivally from 
directly beneath the oculus. Once a visitor reached the center, 
molded space and applied decoration combined to provide a stun¬ 
ning effect. Beginning in the Renaissance, scholars have found 
fault with the Pantheon s architect for neglecting to align the ribs 
between the dome coffers with the pilasters in the attic zone and 
the ground-floor columns. The design is not without logic: a void 
or a row of coffers aligns exactly over each central intercolumni- 
ation (space between columns) on the ground floor. All the same,

the absence of a systemic network of continuous vertical lines 
between top and bottom means that, visually speaking, the dome 
is not anchored. The optical effect is that it hovers unfettered 
above the visitor—who feels, paradoxically, both sheltered and 
exposed. The dome seems to be in perpetual motion, spinning 
overhead in the same way as the heavens it imitates. An all-but- 
imperceptible rise in the floor at the center exaggerates this sensa¬ 
tion, which can incite an unnerving feeling similar to vertigo. A 
visitor s instinct, in response, is to take refuge in the safety of the 
curved wall. The building is all experience, and photographs do it 
no justice. This is the place, so literary sources relate, where 
Hadrian preferred to hold court, greeting foreign embassies and 
adjudicating disputes here. The temple s form cast the emperor in 
an authoritative position as controller of his revolving universe. 
He must have appeared like a divine revelation before his guests, 
who were already awed and completely manipulated by the 
building that enclosed them. 

The Pantheon is the extraordinary result of an increased con¬ 
fidence in the potential and strength of concrete. The architect 
calibrated the aggregate as the building rose, from travertine to 
tufa, then brick, and finally pumice, to reduce its weight. The 
dome s weight is concentrated on eight wide pillars between the 
interior alcoves, rather than resting uniformly on the drum (the 
circular cella wall) (see fig. 7.26). The alcoves, in turn, with their 
screens of columns, visually reduce the solidity of the walls, and 
colored marbles on the interior surfaces add energy to the whole.

As in Trajan’s Forum, the marbles were symbolic. They under¬ 
lined the vast reach of imperial authority, assuming trade with or 
control over Egypt (gray and rose-pink granite, porphyry), 
Phrygia (Phrygian purple and white stone), the island of Teos 
(Lucullan red and black stone), and Chemtou in Tunisia 
(Numidian yellow stone). 

HADRIAN’S VILLA AT TIVOLI As well as commissioning 
public architecture, emperors also built magnificent residences for 
themselves. From the start of the Empire, the emperor’s principal 
home was on the Palatine Hill in Rome (from which the term 
“palace” derives). Yet, like many members of the elite, he had sev¬ 
eral properties, many of which were outside of Rome. The most 
famous is the Villa of Hadrian at Tibur (present-day Tivoli). Built 
on the site of a Republican villa, this residence was a vast sprawl¬ 
ing complex of buildings, some or all of which Hadrian may have 
designed himself. The villa’s forms appear to follow the natural 
line of the landscape, but in fact massive earthworks rearranged 
the terrain to accommodate the architecture and to allow for 
impressive vistas, cool retreats, and surprise revelations. Water 
was a common feature, in pools and running channels, adding 
sound and motion, reflecting light, and offering coolness in the 
summer heat. Throughout the villa were mosaics, paintings, and 
sculptures. The emperor may have collected some of these works 


of art during his extensive travels, especially in Egypt and Greece. 
A desire to evoke the far-flung regions of the Empire may also 
have inspired some of the buildings: A fourth-century ce biogra¬ 
pher claims that Hadrian “built up his villa at Tibur in an extraor¬ 
dinary way, applying to parts of it the renowned names of 
provinces and places, such as the Lyceum, the Academy, the 
prytaneum , the Canopus, the Poecile , and Tempe. And so as to 
omit nothing, he even fashioned ‘infernal regions.’” This state¬ 
ment has led modern scholars to give fanciful names to many 
parts of the villa. Few of them are based on archaeological 
evidence, and they lead visitors to faulty conclusions about the 
buildings’ functions. The canal shown in figure 7.28 has long been 
known as the Canopus, after a town in Egypt. Only recently have 
scholars proposed more neutral terms for the villa’s components, 
in this case the “Scenic Canal. ” 

Portrait Sculpture 

By the time Augustus had effectively become emperor, he was no 
more than 36. With its stress on maturity, the veristic portrait 
style so characteristic of the Republic might have served to under¬ 
line his unusual, not to say aconstitutional, status in Rome. 
Perhaps as a consequence, Augustus turned instead to a more 
Hellenizing style. Portraits made right up to his death in his late

seventies depict him as an ageless youth, as seen in a statue discov¬ 
ered in the house of his wife Livia at Primaporta (fig. 7.29). The 
emperor appears in battledress with his arm raised in a gesture of 
address. The portrait seems to combine a series of references to 
previous works of art and historical events in order to strengthen 
Augustus’ claim to authority.

The chiastic stance, and the smooth features of Augustus’ face, 
are so reminiscent of Polykleitos’ Doryphoros (see fig. 5.33) that 
scholars assume that Augustus turned deliberately to this well- 
known image. There was good reason for this kind of imitation: 
The Classical Greek style evoked the apogee of Athenian culture, 
casting Augustan Rome as Greece’s successor (and conqueror) in 
cultural supremacy. Even Augustus’ hair is similar to that of the 
Doryphoros—except, that is, at the front, where the locks part 
slightly over the center of the brow, a subtle reference to 
Alexander the Great, another youthful general, whose cowlick 
was such a distinctive feature of his portraits (see fig. 5.69). 

Next to Augustus’ right ankle, a cupid playfully rides a dol¬ 
phin, serving as a strut to strengthen the marble. Most Romans 
would have recognized that Cupid, or Eros, the son of Venus, 
symbolized Augustus’ claim of descent from the goddess of love 
through his Trojan ancestor Aeneas. The dolphin evoked the sea, 
and specifically the site off the coast of Actium where Augustus 
had prevailed over Mark Antony and Cleopatra in a celebrated 
naval battle in 31 bce. By associating Augustus with historical or 
divine figures, these references projected an image of earthly and 
divinely ordained power, thereby elevating the emperor above 
other politicians. 

The iconography of Augustus’ breastplate serves a similar 
purpose by calling attention to an important event in 20 bce, when 
the Parthians returned standards that they had captured, to Roman 
shame, in 53 bce. A figure usually identified as Tiberius, Augustus’ 
eventual successor, or the god Mars, accepts the standards from a 
Parthian soldier, possibly King Phraates IV. Celestial gods and 
terrestrial personifications frame the scene, giving the event a

cosmic and eternal significance. This diplomatic victory took on 
momentous proportions in Augustan propaganda. The scene 
suggests that the portrait dates to about 19 bce. The emperor is 
barefoot, which usually denotes divine status. Later in the Roman 
period, or in the Eastern Empire, emperors might be depicted as 
gods while still alive, but with Caesar’s legacy still fresh in Roman 
minds, it is unlikely that Augustus would have been so presump¬ 
tuous. Some scholars therefore conclude that the statue is a 
posthumous copy of a bronze original dating to about 20 bce. 

The Primaporta Augustus offers a good example of a tendency 
in Roman art to express a message through references to earlier 
works. Naturally, not all Romans would have understood all the 
references in any given work, but the frequency of visual “quota¬ 
tions” suggests that Romans, like many other ancient peoples, 
were extremely visually astute. In fact, the history of Roman 
portraiture, as with many other branches of Roman art, is one of 
constant association with, and negation of (or conscious turning 
away from), past images. In their portraits, Augustus’ dynastic 
successors, for instance, look very much like the first emperor 
from whom they drew their authority, even though they were 
rarely (or at best distantly) related by blood. But then, with the 
emperor Vespasian, founder of the Flavian dynasty, there was a 
return to a more veristic style of portrait (fig. 7.30). Scholars 
reason that this maneuver was part of a deliberate attempt to 
restore social order when he came into power in 69 ce, after a year 
of civil war. A soldier by background, Vespasian justified his 
authority through his military success, and appealed to the rank 
and file through this harshly matter-of-fact image. However,

several years later, Hadrian’s portraits revived the classicism asso¬ 
ciated with Augustus, taking the Greek style even further. 
Nicknamed “The Greekling” by the ancients for his admiration 
of Greek culture, he adopted the full beard that was characteristic 
of Greek philosophers (fig. 7.31); ancient reports that he was 
trying to conceal scars from acne are unlikely to be true. It was in 
his reign that sculptors began to carve the pupils and irises of eyes, 
rather than painting them. 

Imperial portraits survive in great multitudes. They fall into a 
number of types, suggesting that there was a master portrait, often 
executed for a specific occasion, which sculptors would copy for 
dissemination within and outside of Rome; other sculptors would 
copy these copies, in turn, leading to a ripple effect around the 
empire. Thousands of portraits of nonimperial subjects also 
survive. Scholars can rarely identify them, but date them on the 
basis of similarities with members of the imperial family. When 
dealing with female portraits, hairstyles are especially useful 
since they change relatively rapidly. Livia’s simple coiffure, with a 
roll, or nodus , at the front is a far cry from the towering hairstyle 
of Domitia Longina, wife of Domitian, one of Vespasian’s sons 
(fig. 7.32). Built around a framework (often of wicker), her 
coiffure was a masterpiece in itself, and its representation in

206 PART I THE ANCIENT WORLD 








sculpture reflected her status, as well as affording the sculptor 
an opportunity to explore contrasts of texture between skin and 
hair, and to drill deep into the marble for a strong play of light 
and shadow. 

Beginning in the second half of the second century ce, Roman 
portraits gradually take on a more abstract quality This is per¬ 
ceptible in a spectacular gilded bronze portrait of Marcus 
Aurelius, which was spared the melting pot in the medieval period 
because Christians misidentified the subject as Constantine the 
Great, champion of Christianity (fig. 7.33). With one arm out¬ 
stretched in a gesture of mercy, the emperor sits calmly astride a 
spirited horse, whose raised front leg once rested on a conquered 
barbarian. As in the portrait of Hadrian and the vast majority of 
second- and third-century ce male portraits, Marcus Aurelius is 
bearded. He was interested in philosophy, and his Stoic musings 
still survive as the “Meditations.” Sculpture of the time reflects 
such abstract concerns. For example, his eyelids fall in languid 
fashion over his pupils, lending them a remote quality. 


Relief Sculpture 

The Republican practice of commissioning narrative reliefs to 
record specific events continued well into the Empire. The reliefs 
were mounted on public buildings and monuments, such as the 
Ara Pads Augustae , or Altar of Augustan Peace, as well as com¬ 
memorative columns and arches. 

THE ARA PACIS AUGUSTAE ALTAR OF AUGUSTAN 
PEACE The Senate and People of Rome vowed the Ara Pads 
Augustae (fig. 7.34) in 13 bce when Augustus returned safely from 
Spain and Gaul, and it was dedicated in 9 bce. It stood inside a 
marble enclosure, which was open to the sky and richly sculpted 
over its entire surface. On east and west sides, flanking two 
entrances, relief panels represent allegorical figures, or personifi¬ 
cations, and figures from Romes legendary past. On the west end, 
a fragmentary panel shows a she-wolf suckling the infants 
Romulus and Remus, under the watchful eyes of the shepherd

Faustulus, who discovered and adopted them. In a second relief, 

Aeneas (or perhaps, according to a recent interpretation, Numa, 
second king of Rome) makes a sacrifice at an altar of roughly 
hewn stones. At the east end, a relief depicting the goddess Roma 
seated on her weapons balances a panel with a female figure (the 
goddess Venus or Ceres, perhaps, or Peace, Italia, or Mother 
Earth) embodying the notion of peace. Together, the panels 
express the message of peace that Augustus was intent on pro¬ 
moting, in contrast with the bleakness of the preceding civil 
wars. The same message was implicit in the acanthus relief that 
encircles the enclosure in a lower register. Vegetation unfurls in 
rich abundance, populated with small creatures such as lizards 
and frogs. 

On north and south sides, the upper register contains contin¬ 
uous procession friezes that portray members of the imperial 
family interspersed with the college of priests and senators (fig. 

7.35). The friezes record a particular event on the day of the altar s 
dedication. A large gap in the relief falls exactly on Augustus, 
whose action remains unidentified. Still, the friezes are significant 
for a number of reasons. In their superficial resemblance to the 
Greek Parthenon frieze (see figs. 5.45 and 5.46), they bear witness, 
once again, to a preference for Greek styles in the Augustan age. 

They also include a number of women from the imperial family, 
including Livia, and small children. Their inclusion probably 
denotes the importance of dynasty, as well as referring to moral 
legislation Augustus enacted to curb adultery and promote child¬ 
birth among the elite. 7.36 Arch of Titus, Rome. ca. 81 ce. Marble

THE ARCH OF TITUS Reliefs also decorated free-standing 
arches. Members of the elite first erected arches during the 
Republic, though no early examples survive. During the Empire, 
many arches celebrated triumphs, but they also served as 
commemorative monuments for the dead. Their enduring 
impact on Western architecture is readily understandable: As 
with free-standing columns, their chief raison d'etre was to 
express a visual message. Often they stood at or near an entrance 
to a public area, and framed the transition, or liminal space 
(from limen , Latin for “threshold”), between one place and 
another. Many societies consider liminal spaces unsettling and 
in need of protection; the lamassu of Mesopotamia, one might 
note, guarded doorways (see fig. 2.18). The Arch of Titus, son 
and successor of Vespasian, stands at the far eastern end of the 
Roman Forum. It is the earliest surviving free-standing arch 
in Rome, though much of it is the product of architect Giuseppe 
Valadiers restoration from 1822 to 1824 (fig. 7.36). It may 
have been a triumphal monument, but given that its inscription 
and a small relief panel describe Titus as a god, it is more 
likely that it commemorates his apotheosis (or divinization) 
after his death in 81 ce. Its principal sculptural relief panels are 
within the bay, and both refer to the triumph after the 
destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 ce. In one 


of them, soldiers carry booty through the streets, including 
a seven-branched menorah (a Jewish candelabra) and other 
sacred furniture looted from the Temple (fig. 7.37). The panel 
marks an important move toward spatial illusionism. Two ranks 
of figures appear, carved in different levels of relief. The 
background figures are in such shallow relief that they seem to 
fade into the distance. The procession breaks away abruptly at 
the sides, so that it appears to continue beyond a viewer s line of 
sight. On the right, it disappears through a triumphal arch, 
placed at an angle to the background so that only the nearer half 
emerges in relief, giving the illusion of spatial depth. The panel 
even bulges out slightly at the center, so that it seems to turn 
right in front of a viewer standing inside the archs bay, making 
the viewer a part of the action. In the other panel, Titus rides in 
a triumphal chariot, high above a teeming crowd, signified 
through differing levels of relief (fig. 7.38). The horses appear 
in profile, but the chariot is frontal, giving the illusion that 
the procession is approaching a viewer before turning sharply. 
Behind the emperor, a personification of victory crowns him 
for his success. Additional personifications—Honor and Virtue, 
perhaps, or Roma—accompany the chariot. Their presence, and 
the absence of Vespasian, whom the Jewish historian Josephus 
places in the scene, sound a cautionary note for those who

OURCE 


Josephus (37 /8-ca. 100 ce) 



The Jewish War, from Book YII 

The Jewish soldier and historian Josephus Flavius was born Joseph Ben 
Matthias in Jerusalem. He was named commander of Galilee during 
the uprising of66-70 CE against the Romans in the reign of Nero. Afeer 
surrendering , he won the favor of the general Titus Flavius Sahinus 
Vespasian and took the name Flavius as his own. Josephus moved 
to Rome, where he wrote an account of the war (75-79 CE) and 
Antiquities of the Jews (93 CE). The following passage from his history 
of the rebellion describes the triumphal procession into Rome following 
the Sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE, which is depicted on the Arch of Titus 
(figs. 7.38 and 7.39). 

I t is impossible to give a worthy description of the great number of 
splendid sights and of the magnificence which occurred in every 
conceivable form, be it works of art, varieties of wealth, or natural 
objects of great rarity For almost all the wondrous and expensive 
objects which had ever been collected, piece by piece, from one land 
and another, by prosperous men—all this, being brought together 
for exhibition on a single day, gave a true indication of the greatness 
of the Roman Empire. For a vast amount of silver and gold and ivory, 
wrought into every sort of form, was to be seen, giving not so much 
the impression of being borne along in a procession as, one might say, 
of flowing by like a river. Woven tapestries were carried along, some 


dyed purple and of great rarity, others having varied representations 
of living figures embroidered on them with great exactness, the 
handiwork of Babylonians. Transparent stones, some set into gold 
crowns, some displayed in other ways, were borne by in such great 
numbers that the conception which we had formed of their rarity 
seemed pointless. Images of the Roman gods, of wondrous size and 
made with no inconsiderable workmanship, were also exhibited, and 
of these there was not one which was not made of some expensive 
material. ... 

The rest of the spoils were borne along in random heaps. The most 
interesting of all were the spoils seized from the temple of Jerusalem: 
a gold table weighing many talents, and a lampstand, also made 
of gold, which was made in a form different from that which we 
usually employ. For there was a central shaft fastened to the base; 
then spandrels extended from this in an arrangement which rather 
resembled the shape of a trident, and on the end of each of these 
spandrels a lamp was forged. There were seven of these, emphasizing 
the honor accorded to the number seven among the Jews. The law of 
the Jews was borne along after these as the last of the spoils. In the 
next section a good many images of Victory were paraded by. The 
workmanship of all of these was in ivory and gold. Vespasian drove 
along behind these and Titus followed him; Domitian rode beside 
them, dressed in a dazzling fashion and riding a horse which was 
worth seeing.

would read Roman visual narratives as accurate accounts of 
historical events. (See Primary Source, above.) Artists constructed 
these narratives to express a version of events that served the 
patron s ideology. 


THE COLUMN OF TRAJAN The exploration of space and 
narrative strategies comes into full bloom in the Column of Trajan 
(fig. 7.39), erected between 106 and 113 ce in a small court to the 
west of Trajan s Forum (see figs. 7.17 and 7.18). Soaring about 150

Roman feet high, this supported a gilded statue of the emperor, 
lost in medieval times. Winding through the interior of its shaft 
was a spiral staircase leading to a viewing platform, from which a 
visitor could look out over Trajans extraordinary building com¬ 
plex. Free-standing columns had been used as commemorative 
monuments in Greece from Hellenistic times, but the sheer scale 
of Trajan’s Column, usually credited as the work of Apollodorus, 
along with its role as belvedere (or viewing station), makes it 
nothing short of a world wonder. However, art historians have 
tended to focus not on the engineering feat the column represents, 
but on the 656-foot-long continuous narrative relief that winds 
around its shaft in a counterclockwise direction, celebrating the 
emperor’s victorious campaigns against the people of Dacia (in 
present-day Romania). 

The narrative begins with the Roman army’s crossing of the 
Danube to reach Dacian territory (fig. 7.40). The river appears as 
a large personification. To the left are riverboats loaded with sup¬ 
plies and a Roman town on a rocky bank. The second band shows 
Trajan speaking to his soldiers, and soldiers building fortifica¬ 
tions. In the third, soldiers construct a garrison camp and bridge 
as the cavalry sets out on a reconnaissance mission; and in the

CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 211 















fourth, foot soldiers cross a stream while, to the right, the 
emperor addresses his troops in front of a Dacian fortress. These 
scenes are a fair sampling of events shown on the column. Among 
the more than 150 episodes, combat occurs only rarely. The geo¬ 
graphic, logistic, and political aspects of the campaign receive 
more attention, much as they do in Julius Caesars literary 
account of his conquest of Gaul. 

Individual scenes are not distinctly separate from one another. 
Sculptors placed trees and buildings in such a way as to suggest 
divisions, but the scenes still merge into a continuous whole, with 
important protagonists, such as Trajan, appearing multiple times. 
Thus, they preserved visual continuity without sacrificing the 
coherence of each scene. Although Assyrian and Egyptian artists 
created visual narratives of military conquests, this relief is by far 
the most ambitious composition so far in terms of the number of 
figures and the density of the narrative, and understanding it is a 
complicated matter. Continuous illustrated rotuli (scrolls) are a 
likely inspiration for the composition, if such things existed 
before the column s construction. 

Also problematic is the fact that in order to follow the narra¬ 
tive sequence, a viewer has to keep turning around the column, 
head inclined upward. Above the fourth or fifth turn, details 
become hard to make out with the naked eye, even if the addition 
of paint made the sculpture more vivid. It might have been possi¬ 
ble to view the upper spirals from balconies on surrounding 


buildings in antiquity, but the format would still have required an 
encircling motion. These problems have led scholars to propose 
viewing strategies. They have long noted that the relief is formu¬ 
laic; that is, the sculptors repeated a fairly limited number of stock 
scenes again and again. These include, for instance, sacrifice 
scenes, the emperor addressing his troops, or soldiers construct¬ 
ing forts and dismantling enemy cities. Though these are not iden¬ 
tical, they are similar enough to be recognized at a distance, which 
helps make the upper spirals more legible. The designer may also 
have aligned important and representative scenes on the cardinal 
axes of the column, so that a viewer could grasp an abbreviated 
version of the whole from a single standpoint. Yet there is always 
the possibility that the designer intended viewers to have to turn 
around the column in order to read its narrative. The column s 
base would serve as a burial chamber for Trajans ashes after his 
death in 117 ce, and an encircling motion would be entirely con¬ 
sistent with a widespread Roman funerary ritual known as the 
decursio , in which visitors to a tomb walked around it to protect 
the dead buried within, to keep harmful spirits in the grave, and 
to pay perpetual homage to the deceased. 

THE COLUMN BASE OF ANTONINUS PIUS The point at 
which the classicizing phase of Roman sculpture, still so evident 
on the Column of Trajan, starts to yield to the more abstract style 
of late antiquity—with its less naturalistic, more linear treatment

of the body—is a matter of some debate. A critical shift may have 
taken place with the column base of Antoninus Pius and his wife, 
Faustina the Elder. Antoninus died in 161 ce. His successors, 
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, erected a 50-foot porphyry 
column in his honor, surmounted by his statue. Its white marble 
base is all that survives. One side bears an inscription. On another 
is an apotheosis scene, where a winged figure bears the emperor 
and his wife to the heavens, while personifications of the Field of 
Mars (where the cremation took place) and Rome look on (fig. 
7.41). The figures have lithe, Classical proportions, and idealized 
faces, with smooth, even planes and ageless features. On the two 
remaining sides of the base, Roman cavalrymen ride in a counter¬ 
clockwise circle around a group of infantrymen, in nearly identi¬ 
cal scenes that probably represent the decursio around the funeral 
pyre. The sculptural style of these scenes is unlike the apotheosis 
scene. The soldiers have stocky, squat proportions, and the action 
unfolds in a birds-eye perspective, while the soldiers are viewed 


from the side. Both of these factors find parallels in sculpture 
commissioned in the provinces and in nonelite circles. Figure 7.42 
shows a nonelite style, in a funerary relief commemorating a 
butcher and a woman. The image has a flatness that is different 
from the illusionistic treatment of space on the panels of the Arch 
of Titus (see figs. 7.37 and 7.38) The figures are stocky, and the 
butchers head is large in proportion to his body. The artists 
priority was probably legibility: The patron would have mounted 
the panel on the facade of a tomb, so that viewers could see it from 
a distance. The linear treatment of the image and the boldness of 
the forms served this goal well. The introduction of these quali¬ 
ties into imperial commissions in Rome signals a change in the 
way state art expressed messages. 

Art and Architecture in the Provinces 

The spread of Romes authority over a wide geographical reach 
had a profound impact on artistic and architectural production in 
those areas. As Romes political and cultural institutions reached 
the provinces, so did the architectural and artistic forms that 
accommodated them. Sometimes provincial monuments are all 
but indistinguishable from those in the city of Rome; but more 
often the syncretism of Roman forms and indigenous styles and 
materials led to works that were at once recognizably Roman and 
yet distinctive to their locale. 

The principal written sources on the provinces tend to be 
works by Romans. For this reason, it is hard to assess how 
provincial peoples reacted to Roman rule. But it certainly brought 
them some benefits. For instance, Roman engineers had mastered 
the art of moving water efficiently, and the new aqueducts that 
sprang up in urban centers around the Empire must have 
improved local standards of living immeasurably A striking aque¬ 
duct still stands at Segovia in Spain, dating to the first or early sec¬ 
ond century ce (fig. 7.43). It brought water from Riofrfo, about

10 Vi miles (17 km) away, flowing for most of its length through an 
underground channel. Approaching the town, however, architects 
built a massive bridge stretching 2,666 feet long and up to 98 feet 
high to span a valley. One hundred and eighteen arches support 
the water channel, superimposed in two registers at the highest 
point. Like most provincial builders, the architects used a local 
stone, in this case granite, which they assembled without mortar 
and left unfinished to give it an air of strength. Despite the obvi¬ 
ous practical advantages the aqueduct provided, the design also 
illustrates how Roman architecture could effect dominion. The 
arches—such a quintessential^ Roman form—march relentlessly 
across the terrain, symbolically conquering it with their step. 
Even the act of moving water was a conquest of a kind, a conquest 
of Nature. 

THE MAISON CAREE, NIMES Romans carried their way of 
life with them across the Empire, constructing theaters and 
amphitheaters in a Roman style, and temples to accommodate 
their rituals. A well-preserved temple (fig. 7.44) known as the 
Maison Carree (Square House) survives in the French town of 
Nimes (ancient Nemausus). Typically Roman, it stands on a high 
podium, with a frontal staircase. Six Corinthian columns across 
the front lead into a deep porch and to the cella; engaged columns 
decorate the cella s exterior walls. Reconstructing an inscription 


in bronze letters on its architrave from the evidence of dowel 
holes, scholars long thought the temple to have been dedicated to 
Rome and Augustus during the Augustan age. Acanthus scrolls in 
the frieze appeared to be reminiscent of the Ara Pads , and the 
masonry style showed similarities to that of the Temple of Mars 
the Avenger in Augustus’ Forum. Indeed, scholars once consid¬ 
ered the temple evidence for traveling workshops. Recent 
research has cast doubt on this view, though, and illustrates the 
danger that historians may construct the very history they are 
looking for by interpreting evidence to fit preconceived theories. 
As it turns out, the dowel holes could support any number of 
different inscriptions; and the module (construction measure) 
employed throughout the building only came into use under 
Trajan. The building could be a temple dedicated to Trajan’s wife, 
Plotina, as attested in literary sources. 

EL KHASNEH, PETRA In some cases, the syncretism of 
indigenous building traditions with Roman styles resulted in 
powerful new effects. This appears to be the case with the extraor¬ 
dinary rock-cut facade known as El Khasneh, or the Treasury, at 
the site of Petra in present-day Jordan (fig. 7.45). This facade is the 
first sight to greet a visitor who wanders through the long, twist¬ 
ing gorge known as the Siq, leading to the town center. The 
Nabataeans, a nomadic people who settled this area before the

Romans took control in 106 ce, buried their wealthy dead in 
tombs cut out of the pink sandstone cliffs, and some have seen El 
Khasneh as one of their monuments. Most now agree, however, 
that it belongs to the Trajanic or Hadrianic period. Carved from 
the living rock, the monument resembles a temple facade, with six 
columns beneath an architrave decorated with floral designs and a 
pediment. In a second story, lateral columns support the angles of 
a broken pediment. Between them is a tholos with a conical roof, 
surmounted by an ornamental finial. In modern times, locals 
imagined that pirates had stored their treasure in the finial, lend¬ 
ing the monument its name; bullet holes show how they tried to 
knock it down. The facade is a striking amalgamation of a 
Nabataean concept with Roman decorative features—the 
Corinthian column capitals, for instance, and the vegetal designs. 
The architectural elements are not structural, and this allows for a 
freedom and quality of fantasy in the design, not unlike the 
fantasy vistas of Second Style wall paintings (see page 221). This 


playful treatment of once-structural elements became popular in 
the provinces and in Rome in the second century ce, and scholars 
sometimes describe it as a “baroque” phase, for its similarities to 
Italian Baroque architecture. The monuments function may have 
changed for Roman usage as well: Relief sculptures between the 
columns seem to represent figures from the cult of Isis, suggest¬ 
ing that it was a temple. In some cases, inscriptions and other 
written documents indicate who commissioned monuments in 
the provinces; the patron might be local, a Roman official, or even 
the emperor himself. More often, as in this case, there is no such 
evidence, which makes it hard to determine meaning in a particu¬ 
lar choice of design. 

SCULPTURE AND PAINTING Sculpture in the Roman 
provinces also has a distinctive look—the result, generally, of a 
merging of different traditions. A limestone funerary relief from 
Palmyra in Syria from the second half of the second century ce 
(fig. 7.46) once sealed the opening to a burial within a character¬ 
istically Palmyrene monument, a tower tomb. An Aramaic 
inscription identifies the subject as Tibnan, an elite woman, who 
holds a small child in one arm. The language bespeaks her origin, 
and the strict frontality, large staring eyes, and local dress and 
headband set her apart from elite women of Rome (see fig. 7.32). 
All the same, the portrait has distinctly Roman qualities: Tibnan

raises her right hand, for instance, to hold her veil, in a Roman 
gesture that signified chastity (or pudicitia , defined as loyalty to 
ones husband) (see fig. 7.13). The portrait neatly encapsulates the 
dual identity of this provincial woman, who is both Palmyrene 
and Roman. 

The largest body of painting to survive from the Roman world 
is wall painting (see page 218). Yet the sands of Fayum, in Lower 
Egypt, preserved a magnificent group of painted portraits, once 
attached over the faces of embalmed, mummified corpses (fig. 
7.47). The earliest of them appear to date from the second century

ce. Artists painted them on wooden panels in the encaustic 
technique, which involves suspending pigments in hot wax. The 
mixture can be opaque and creamy, like oil paint, or thin and 
translucent. The medium is extremely durable, and the panels 
retain an extraordinary freshness; the wax also gives them a 
lustrous vitality. The quality of the portraits varies dramatically. 
At their best, they have a haunting immediacy, largely the result 
of the need to work quickly before the hot wax set. The woman 
pictured here wears a crimson tunic and a wealth of jewelry. Rows 
of black circles denote the ringlets of her hair, bound with a 
golden diadem. Her appearance is Roman, yet the portrait itself 
speaks of her local identity, since she was buried in the Egyptian, 
not the Roman, fashion. As a result, these portraits belong rightly 
in the history of both Roman art and Egyptian art. 


Domestic Art and Architecture 

The Romans are one of the few ancient peoples to have left abun¬ 
dant evidence of domestic architecture and its decoration. This is 
largely due to the catastrophic eruption of Vesuvius in 79 ce, 
which left the nearby cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum buried 
under a thick blanket of ash and lava. When excavations began in 
Pompeii in the eighteenth century, archaeologists discovered a 
city frozen in time. Utensils and remnants of furniture were still 
in place in houses, inns, and bath buildings, allowing historians to 
reconstruct the rituals of daily life in extraordinary detail. 

POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM In its early days, the Oscans 
inhabited Pompeii. Another early Italic tribe, the Samnites, took 
control in the late fifth century bce, and the city s monumental- 
ization began under their aegis, and under the influence of nearby 
Greek cities. After the Social War of 90-89 bce, the Roman dicta¬ 
tor Sulla refounded Pompeii as a Roman colony. Like other 
colonies, which took their design from Roman army camps, 
Pompeii had two main streets, the cardo and the decumanus (fig. 
7.48). At their intersection stood the forum, the civic heart of the 
city, near which the Pompeiians built the principal temples and 
two theaters. Interspersed among surrounding streets were 
houses and the other buildings that accommodated everyday 
Roman life: baths for daily bathing and socializing, taverns and 
fast-food kitchens, launderers with their great vats of urine for 
washing clothes, and brothels. A state-of-the-art amphitheater on 
the outskirts of the city, which was a prototype for the 
Colosseum, provided gladiatorial entertainments, and outside the 
city gates the wealthy buried their dead in monumental tombs. In 
the Augustan period, an aqueduct brought fresh water to the pub¬ 
lic fountains that flowed continuously throughout the city. Water 
flushed the basalt-paved streets to keep them clean, and raised 
steppingstones allowed pedestrians to cross from sidewalk to 
sidewalk without getting wet. 

The unusually good state of preservation of the houses of 
Pompeii and Herculaneum means that they dominate scholarly 
discussion, as they will here; yet such was the durability of 
Roman domestic construction that houses survive elsewhere as

well, as far afield as Morocco and Jordan, and although Roman 
houses have many common qualities, they also differ from one 
region to the next, to cater, for instance, to local climates. One 
should be cautious, therefore, about conceiving of a “typical” 

Roman house. 

Scholars describe elite Roman houses by their Latin name, 
domus, known from Vitruvius and other ancient writing (fig. 

7.49). (See www.myartslab.com. ) Its most distinctive feature is an 
atrium, a square or oblong central hall lit by an opening in the 
roof, answered by a shallow pool, or impluvium, in the ground 
to collect rainwater. The airy quality of the atrium confers an ele¬ 
ment of grandeur upon the house, visible here in the House of the 
Silver Wedding (fig. 7.50), and by tradition it was where Romans 7 5 0 Atrium of the House of the silver We dding, Pompeii, 

kept portraits of ancestors. Other rooms, such as bedrooms 2nd century bce-79 ce 



CHAPTER 7 ROMAN ART 217 
















7.51 Model of apartment block 

(cubicula), group around the atrium, which often leads to a 
tablinum , a reception room, where the family kept its archives. 
Beyond the tablinum, a colonnade (the peristyle) surrounds a gar¬ 
den, where the owner could display sculpture and take fresh air. 
There might be additional rooms at the back of the house. The 
chief light source was the atrium and the peristyle; walls facing the 
street did not typically have windows, but one should not be 
misled into believing that these houses were therefore particularly 
private. Romans routinely used rooms flanking the entryway as 
shops, and the front door often stood open. At the heart of 
Roman society was a client-patron relationship, and clients 
routinely visited their patrons in their homes, in a morning ritual 
known as the salutatio. The householder also conducted business 
in his home, even in the bedrooms. A visitor’s access to the differ¬ 
ent parts of the house depended on his relationship with the 
owner, who would greet most visitors in the large central rooms. 

In any given region of the Empire, there were huge discrepan¬ 
cies between the houses of the rich and the dwellings of the poor. 
Abandoned in the Middle Ages, Romes port city, Ostia, preserves 
many examples of high-occupancy dwellings, known as insulae 
(literally "islands”) (fig. 7.51). An insula was generally a substan¬ 
tial concrete-and-brick building (or chain of buildings) around a 
small central court, with many features of a present-day apart¬ 
ment block. On the ground floor, shops and taverns opened to the 
street; above lived numerous families in cramped quarters. Some 


insulae had as many as five stories, with balconies above the 
second floor. Wealthy property owners often made a handsome 
income from these buildings. 

MAU’S FOUR STYLES OF PAINTING Compared with 
Greek painting, Roman domestic painting—mostly wall paint¬ 
ing—survives in great abundance. It comes mainly from Pompeii 
and Herculaneum, and also from Rome and its environs, and it 
dates mostly to a span of less than 200 years, from the end of the 
second century bce to the late first century ce. Given the public 
character of a domus, these paintings were more than mere deco¬ 
ration: They also testified to a family’s wealth and status. 

Basing his analysis partly on Vitruvius’ discussion of painting, 
the late nineteenth-century German art historian August Mau 
distinguished four styles of Roman wall painting (fig. 7.52), which 
are useful as general guidelines. (See www.myartslab.com. ) In the 
First Style, dating to the late second century bce, artists used 
paint and stucco to imitate expensive colored marble paneling. 
Starting about 100 bce, Second Style painters sought to open up 
the flat expanse of the wall by including architectural features 
and figures. In a room in the Villa of the Mysteries just outside 
Pompeii, dating from about 60 to 50 bce, the lower part of the 
wall (the dado) and the upper section above the cornice level 
are painted in rich mottled colors to resemble exotic stone (fig. 
7.53). Figures interact as if on a narrow ledge set against a deep

red background, articulated by upright strips of black resem¬ 
bling stylized columns. They are engaged in rites associated with 
the Dionysiac mysteries, one of the so-called mystery religions 
originating in Greece. The scene may represent an initiation 
into womanhood or marriage, in the presence of Dionysos 
and Ariadne with a train of satyrs. The solidity of the near- 
life-size figures, the bold modeling of their bodies, and their 
calm but varied poses lend a quiet power and vivid drama to 
the room. 

In some cases, Second Style artists employed architectural 
vistas to open the wall into a fantasy realm, suggesting another 
world beyond the room. This movement may reflect architec¬ 
tural backdrops in contemporaneous theaters. In an example 
from the Villa of Publius Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale, near 
Pompeii, now reconstructed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York (fig. 7.54), there is a foreground of architectural 
features: A painted parapet wall runs around the lower part of 
the surface, and resting on it are columns, which support a cor¬ 
nice. Receding away from the foreground, in a range of different 
perspectives, stoas and tholoi and scenic gazebos mingle with 


one another in a maze of architectural fantasy, flooded with light 
to convey a sense of open space. A viewer struggles to disentan¬ 
gle the structures from one other; their size and spatial relation¬ 
ships are hard to determine. The world of the painting is a world 
inaccessible to those who view it, hovering out of reach. In the 
Villa of Livia at Primaporta, the garden beyond the trellis fence 
and low wall is an idyll of nature, filled with flowers, fruit trees, 
and birds (fig. 7.55). Although its lushness beckons, this fantasy 
garden is only for looking. Here the artist employed atmospheric 
perspective: Plants and animals become less distinct as they recede 
into the background. 

The Third Style dominated wall decoration from about 20 bce 
until at least the middle of the first century ce. In this phase, 
artists abandoned illusionism in favor of solid planes of intense 
colors like black and red, which they often articulated with 
attenuated architectural features and imitation panel paintings. 
The Fourth Style, which prevailed at the time of Vesuvius’ 
eruption, was the most intricate of the four, uniting aspects of all 
three preceding styles to create an extravagant effect. The Ixion 
Room in the House of the Vettii (fig. 7.56) combines imitation

marble paneling, framed mythological scenes resembling panel 
pictures set into the wall, and fantastic architectural vistas reced¬ 
ing into space. 

Within these Fourth Style designs, the artist might insert 
still life panels, which usually took the form of trompe-l’oeil 
(intended to trick the eye) niches or cupboards, with objects on 
shelves. A twenty-first-century viewer finds little unusual about 
this, yet these are the only visual studies of mundane, inanimate 
objects until the early modern period. The driving force in these 
paintings was not a narrative, as in many Roman paintings, but a 
close analysis of life. The example illustrated here depicts green 
peaches and a jar half-filled with water (fig. 7.57). Touches of 
white paint capture the effect of light playing on the surface of the 
jar and the water within. Shadows fall in different directions 
around the peaches, suggesting that the artist was more interested 
in forging a spatial relationship between the peaches and their 
surroundings than in indicating a single light source. It is possible, 
too, that the painting reflects the shadows movement as the 
artist worked. 

As in the Ixion Room in the House of the Vettii (see fig. 7.56), 
many Roman paintings depicted Greek themes. The few painters’ 
names on record show that at least some of them were of Greek 
origin. There are also sufficient cases of paintings (or elements of 
paintings) closely resembling one another to indicate that artists 
used copybooks; in some cases, they may have been working 
from a Greek original, adapting the image to their own purposes. 
The Alexander Mosaic in the House of the Faun is a possible 


instance of an artist copying a famous Greek painting, albeit into 
a different medium (see fig. 5.78). Given the scarcity of Greek 
mural paintings, however, it is rarely possible to demonstrate a 
clear connection between Greek original and Roman copy. Given 
the evident innovation in Roman painting, there is no reason to 
suppose that Roman artists were not capable of creating their own 
compositions and narratives when they chose. In recent years, 
scholarship has become less preoccupied with tracing Greek 
influences, and more focused on ways in which painting ensem¬ 
bles affected experience or dictated movement through a house, 
and expressed the owners status. In fact, a genre of ancient 
literature known as ekphrasis is a learned exposition on a real or 
imagined painting. (See n.) On the basis of 

these writings, scholars believe that homeowners sometimes 
conceived paintings as conversation pieces for their guests, who 
might discuss them as they dined. A painting program, then, takes 
on a new level of importance for what it might disclose about the 
patron’s erudition, status, or aspirations. 

THE LATE EMPIRE 

During Marcus Aurelius’ reign, incursions at the Empire’s 
German and Danubian borders were a constant threat. His son 
Commodus succeeded him in 180 ce, and was assassinated in 
192 ce. The imperial administration then hit an all-time low 
when, in 193 ce, the throne was auctioned off to the highest 
bidder. After a brief respite under the Severan dynasty, Rome 
entered a half-century of civil war, when a succession of emperors 
came to power and quickly fell through violence. Diocletian 
(r. 284-305 ce) finally restored imperial authority. His approach 
was to impose rigid order on all aspects of civil as well as 
military life. Recognizing the emperor’s vulnerability, he also 
chose to divide authority among four rulers, known as the 
tetrarchs. Two were senior emperors, the Augusti; and two 
juniors, the Caesars. Terms of power were to be limited, and the 
Caesars were to succeed the Augusti. The tetrarchy dissolved in 
the early fourth century ce, and Constantine the Great, the first 
emperor to embrace Christianity, rose to power, overcoming 
his chief rival, Maxentius, at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge 
in Rome in 312 ce. Art forms are distinctly abstract in late 
antiquity, and scholars sometimes associate the change with the 
militaristic mood of the time. Sculptural forms are less natural¬ 
istic than before, and architects focus on simple but powerful 
geometric shapes. 

Architecture 

By the Late Empire, architects in Rome had more or less aban¬ 
doned the straightforward use of post-and-lintel construction. 
Their interests appear to have focused instead on exploring the 
interior spaces that concrete made possible. Column, architrave, 
and pediment took on decorative roles, superimposed on vaulted 
brick-and-concrete cores. 


222 PART 


THE ANCIENT WORLD 




Painted Stone in Greece and Rome 


F or many people, the prevailing image of Greek and Roman architec¬ 
ture and sculpture is white marble. There is good reason for this: As 
ancient works emerge from the ground, white is the dominant color. 
White columns still gleam majestically against the blues skies of lands 
once Greek or Roman, and white sculptures line the halls of European 
and American museums. Moreover, architects and sculptors such as 
Michelangelo drewtheir inspiration from these colorless pieces, and their 
pristine classicizing works have helped to perpetuate the impression. 

Yet art historians have long noted traces of paint on Greek and 
Roman works of all kinds. As early as 1 81 2, when German archaeolo¬ 
gists unearthed the pedimental sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia 
at Aegina (see fig. 5.22), vestiges of paint fueled a lasting debate 
about color on ancient stone. Initially, attention focused on architec¬ 
ture, but with the discovery of the portrait of Augustus from 
Primaporta in 1 863 (see fig. 7.29), scholars intensified their analysis 
of sculpture as well. Still, as the debate gained strength between the 
twentieth-century world wars, researchers discovered that their labors 
encountered ideological and aesthetic resistance. 

In recent decades, researchers have profited from advances in tech¬ 
nology to attempt convincing reconstructions of well-known ancient 


works as they might once have appeared, including two examples 
shown here: an archer from Aegina and a portrait of the Roman 
emperor Caligula. They use improved ultraviolet light techniques (first 
pioneered by P. de la Coste-Messeliere to examine the frieze of the 
Treasury of the Siphnians at Delphi, see fig. 5.21), and analysis by 
raking light and microscope to find traces of paint that are invisible to 
the naked eye. Other techniques include X-ray diffractometry and 
infrared spectography, which identify specific organic and mineral 
compounds. From these analyses, and from literary evidence such as 
the writings of Pliny the Elder, Vinzenz Brinkmann and others conclude 
that ancient artists employed a rich array of pigments that sometimes 
originated far from their use. Among them were cinnabar for red (from 
Istria and Andalusia), widely available ocher for yellow, azurite for blue 
(from Sinai as well as Italy and Spain), green malachite (from Laurion, 
near Athens), and arsenic for a luminous yellow and orange (from 
Anatolia). To make black paint, they collected smoke from burning 
bones or green wood. Artists also added gold and silver leaf to their 
sculptures. Recent analyses indicate that ancient artists often used 
strong, vibrant colors, a far cry from the muted tones that archaeo¬ 
logists first envisioned.

MATERIALS AND TEC 










7.5 8 Baths of Caracalla, Rome. ca. 211-16 ce 



7.5 9 Plan of Baths of Caracalla 


THE BATHS OF CARACALLA Imperial bath buildings 
demonstrate the new Late Empire architectural interests very 
clearly. By the beginning of the third century ce, public baths 
were a long-established tradition in Roman life. Emperors had 
routinely embellished the city with baths as an act of benefaction. 
Romans who did not own private baths expected to bathe 


publicly most days, but the baths served other functions as well. 
They became a place of social interaction, where Romans con¬ 
ducted business and the wealthy flaunted troops of slaves. The 
Baths of Caracalla, built between 211 and 216 ce, were the most 
extensive and lavish of their kind (figs. 7.58 and 7.59). Set within 
a rectangular perimeter wall, they included the essential bathing 
facilities, arranged in a standardized layout: a cold room 
(frigidarium ), a circular hot room ( caldarium ), and a warm room 
(tepidarium ), as well as a vast swimming pool ( natatio ), changing 
rooms ( apodyteria ), and exercise areas ( palaestrae ). Lecture halls, 
libraries, and temples made for a multifaceted experience within 
its walls. Engineers had long mastered the technology for heating 
the warm rooms: They raised the floors on brick piers, and 
directed hot air from a furnace into the open space below. This is 
known as a hypocaust system. The sheer scale of Caracalla s com¬ 
plex must have been astounding: The principal block of buildings 
measured an immense 656 by 374 feet. Three vast groin vaults 
roofed the largest room, the frigidarium. Luscious marble panels 
revetted the walls, and sculptures animated the halls. 

THE BASILICA OF MAXENTIUS When Maxentius com¬ 
missioned a vast basilica for the center of Rome, the architects 
looked to the massive uninterrupted spaces of bath buildings for

inspiration. Basilicas (from the Greek basileus , meaning “king”) 
had a long history in Rome. Since the Republic, they had served 
as civic halls, and they became a standard feature of Roman 


towns. One of their chief functions was to provide a dignified set¬ 
ting for the courts of law that dispensed justice in the name of the 
emperor. Vitruvius prescribed principles for their placement and 
proportions, but in practice they never conformed to a single type 
and varied from region to region. The Basilica of Maxentius (figs. 
7.60 and 7.61) was built on an even grander scale than the Baths 
of Caracalla and was probably the largest roofed interior in 
Rome. It had three aisles, of which only the north one still stands. 
Transverse barrel vaults covered the lateral aisles, and the wider, 
taller central aisle or nave was covered with three massive groin 
vaults. Since a groin vault concentrates its weight and thrust at the 
four corners (see fig. 7.3), the architect could pierce the nave s 
upper walls with a large clerestory (window in the topmost wall 
zone). As a result, the interior of the basilica must have had a light 
and airy quality. The building had two entrances, each faced by an 
apse: through a transverse vestibule at the east end, and through a 
stepped doorway on the south, leading from the Roman Forum. 
On overcoming Maxentius, Constantine expropriated the basil¬ 
ica. He gave it his own name, and placed his colossal portrait in 
the western apse (see fig. 7.68). Expropriations of this kind were 
not uncommon in Rome, and show how critical it was to have a 
physical presence in the city

Architecture in the Provinces 

By the early second century ce, Roman emperors were no longer 
exclusively from Italy; Trajan came from Spain and Septimius 
Severus was from North Africa. Both emperors embellished their 
native cities with new construction. Severus’ home, Lepcis 
Magna, in present-day Libya, remains remarkably well preserved. 
The emperor was responsible for a grand new forum there, and a 
magnificent basilica with a long central aisle closed by an apse at 
either end (fig. 7.62). Colonnades in two stories provide access to 
the side aisles, which were lower than the nave to permit 
clerestory windows in the upper part of the wall. The wooden 
ceiling has long since perished. 

DIOCLETIAN’S PALACE, SPLIT Developments in Roman 
architecture after Diocletian came to power appear to go hand- 
in-hand with the profound changes he made to society. This is 
clear in his palace at Split (ancient Spalato, in Croatia) overlook¬ 
ing the Adriatic Sea, which he commissioned for his abdication in 
305 ce (figs. 7.63 and 7.64). Although intended as a residence, it is 


essentially a military fort, with defensive walls, gates, and towers. 
As in a military camp, two intersecting colonnaded streets 
stretched between the gates and divided the rectangular space 
within the walls, measuring about 650 by 500 feet, into four blocks. 
The street from the main gate led to a sunken peristyle court. 
Columns on two sides support arcuated (arched) lintels, used only 
sporadically since the early Empire and popular in late antiquity 
They direct a visitor s gaze to the far end of the court, where an 
arcuated lintel set between the two central columns within a ped¬ 
iment creates a frame. It was here that the former emperor made 
public appearances. Behind this grand entrance was a vestibule, 
opening onto the audience hall. To the left of the peristyle court 
stood a large octagonal mausoleum, now used as a cathedral. 
Loosely based upon the Pantheon (see figs. 7.23-7.27), this type 
of imperial mausoleum would be one of the prototypes for 
Christian martyria, burial places of martyred saints. To the right 
of the court Diocletian dedicated a small temple to Jupiter, his 
patron god. The topographical relationship between mausoleum 
and temple implied an equivalency between emperor and god.

THE BASILICA OF CONSTANTIUS, TRIER When 
Diocletian divided authority between the tetrarchs, each of them 
established a capital in a different region of the empire and embel¬ 
lished it with appropriate grandeur. Constantius Chlorus, father 
of Constantine the Great, made his seat at Trier, in present-day 
Germany. There he constructed a basilica, which now functions as 
a church (figs. 7.65 and 7.66). In its design, Classical forms have 
dissolved entirely, leaving vast abstract expanses of solid and void. 
Elongated arches break the great mass of its walls, and serve as 
visual buttresses to frame the windows, beneath which were 
balconies. As vast as the interior was, the architect aspired to 
achieving an illusion of even greater dimensions. The windows in 
the apse are significantly smaller than those in the side walls, and 
the apse ceiling is lower than the ceiling over the main hall. Both 
devices make it appear that the apse recedes farther into the 
distance than it does. Not only did this make the building appear 
grander, but the apse was where the emperor—or his image— 
would hold sway and the altered dimensions would have made 
him appear significantly larger than life. The vocabulary of 
Roman building had changed, in other words, but it remained an 
architecture of power. 


Portrait Sculpture 

During the tetrarchy, portraiture took on a radically abstract 
quality. Two porphyry sculptural groups now immured in the 
Basilica of San Marco in Venice were probably originally 
mounted on columns (fig. 7.67). Each group shows two tetrarchs 
in elaborate military dress, with bird-headed sword hilts and flat 
Pannonian caps that probably represent the powerful Illyrian 
officer class from which they came. The figures are all but indis¬ 
tinguishable from one another (except that in each group, one is 
bearded, the other close-shaven). Their proportions are squat and 
nonnaturalistic, their facial features abstract rather than individu¬ 
alized. The portraits suggest that authority resides in the office of 
emperor, not in the individual who holds the office. The sameness 
of the portraits underlines the tetrarchs' equality, while their close 
embrace stresses unanimity and solidarity The choice of material 
speaks volumes too: Porphyry, a hard Egyptian stone of deep 
purple color, had long been reserved for imperial use. 

The severe abstraction abates only a little under Constantine, 
whose portraitist combined it with an Augustan classicism to 
create the colossal head of figure 7.68. The head is one fragment 
of a vast seated portrait that once occupied an apse in the basilica 
Constantine expropriated from Maxentius (see figs. 7.60 and 
7.61). The head alone is 8 feet tall, and its dominant feature is the 
disproportionately large and deeply carved eyes. Combined with 
the stiff frontality of the face, they give the image an iconic qual¬ 
ity Some scholars associate changes like these with the spiritual¬ 
ity of the later Empire, exemplified by Constantine s adherence to 
Christianity. Perhaps the eyes gaze at something beyond this 
world; perhaps they are a window to the soul. At the same time, 
a soft modeling to the cheeks and mouth renders the portrait 
more naturalistic than its tetrarchic predecessors. Moreover, the

full cap of hair, and the absence of a beard, appear to be direct 
references to Trajan and Augustus, great emperors of the past 
whose achievements still gave the office its authority. 

ReliefSculpture 

The second century ce witnessed a shift in Roman funerary 
customs. Inhumation gradually took the place of cremation for 
all but the imperial family This led to a demand for marble sar¬ 
cophagi in place of cinerary urns, and sculptors decorated them 
with a profusion of designs, which they passed from shop to shop,

probably in pattern books of some kind. Preferences changed 
over time. For example, under Marcus Aurelius, patrons favored 
battle sarcophagi. In the third century ce, biographical and his¬ 
torical scenes preserved aspects of the deceased s life. Most popu¬ 
lar were scenes taken from Greek mythology Their purpose may 
have been to glorify the deceased through analogy to the 
legendary heroes of the past; they may equally have expressed the 
owners erudition. Figure 7.69 illustrates a moment from the myth 
of Meleager. In Homers account, Meleager saved Calydon from a 
ferocious boar, which Artemis had sent to ravage his father s land; 
he then died in a battle over its pelt. For the Romans, Meleager

was an example of noble virtus , or manly prowess. For his hero¬ 
ism and death in the service of his city, he earned immortality. The 
reliefs style owes much to Greek sculpture, but crowding the 
entire surface with figures (known as horror vacui ) is an entirely 
Roman practice. 

THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE In 315 CE, the Senate and 
People of Rome dedicated a triple-bayed arch to Constantine near 
the Colosseum to celebrate his ten-year anniversary and his con¬ 
quest of Maxentius (fig. 7.70). It is one of the largest imperial 
arches, but what makes it unusual is that so little of the sculptural 
relief on its surface was specifically designed for this monument 
(fig. 7.71). The free-standing Dacian captives on the attic (upper 
portion) probably originated in Trajans Forum, as did the Great 
Trajanic Frieze on the ends of the attic and inside the central bay. 
Eight hunting and sacrifice tondi above the lateral bays once 
belonged to a Hadrianic monument, and eight Aurelian panels on 
the attic may have decorated an arch to Marcus Aurelius. When 
the arch was constructed, sculptors recarved the heads of earlier 


emperors to resemble Constantine and his coemperor, Licinius. A 
modern restoration replaced some of them with heads of Trajan. 

Scholars describe sculptural and architectural borrowings of 
this kind by the modern term spolia, from the Latin spolium , 
meaning “hide stripped from an animal,” a term primarily used 
for spoils taken in war. No ancient testimony acknowledges or 
explains the practice, and the spolia raise all manner of 
questions—such as how Romans perceived the stripping of one 
monument in favor of another, and what became of the original 
monument if it was still standing. In a renowned assault on late 
antique sculpture in the 1950s, art historian Bernard Berenson 
condemned the use of spolia as evidence of a pervasive artistic 
decline in the period, which he attributed to a mass exodus of 
artists from a city on the brink of destruction. Other scholars, 
assuming that Romans recognized style differences, see the spolia 
as part of a legitimation ideology, expressing qualities of “emper- 
orness.” By leaning on “good” rulers of the past, Constantine 
may have hoped to harness the reputations that they had earned 
during their lifetimes, as well as the nostalgic idealization that had

7.72 Constantinian relief from Arch of Constantine 


accrued to those reputations through the intervening years. 
Constantine had reason to legitimize his authority: Maxentius had 
been a formidable opponent, with his efforts to reposition Rome 
at the Empire s center through a policy of revivalism. Moreover, 
as the first openly Christian emperor, Constantine risked alienat¬ 
ing a pagan Senate. If this interpretation is correct, it is not dissim¬ 
ilar from readings of the Republican statue base, partly made up 
of Greek reliefs, as seen in figure 7.10. 

To complement the borrowed pieces, Constantinian artists 
carved bases for the columns that flank the bays, a continuous 
relief to encircle the arch above the lateral bays, and roundels for 
the sides of the arch. One scene depicts Constantine addressing 
the Senate and people of Rome from the speaker s platform, or 
rostrum, in the Forum, after entering Rome in 312 ce (fig. 7.72). 
Figures crowd the scene. Their heads are disproportionately large, 
their bodies stocky, and their poses unnaturally rigid. Fines 
carved on the flat surface render anatomical details in place of 
modeling. The artist eschewed devices used on the Arch of Titus 
panels to give an illusion of depth; a second row of heads arranged 
above the first indicates recession (see figs. 7.37 and 7.38). 
Berenson judged the Constantinian reliefs just as harshly as the 
act of spoliation. Yet their abstract quality makes them unusually 


legible from a distance, which is how viewers would have seen 
them. A careful order governs the composition, with the frontal 
emperor occupying the center; other figures turn and focus atten¬ 
tion on him. Buildings in the background are sufficiently distinct 
to make the setting recognizable even today as the Roman Forum. 
The artists privileged the reliefs’ message-bearing potential over 
illusionism or naturalism. 

During the course of about a millennium, Rome grew from a 
small city to the capital of a massive, culturally diverse empire. 
Those years witnessed huge developments in architecture, due as 
much to changes in technology as to political motivations. Post- 
and-lintel construction combined with free forms made possible 
by concrete, and then dissolved in favor of new abstract concepts 
of space. In the provinces, architecture brought some improve¬ 
ments in standards of living, but also helped to secure Roman 
control, exerting a constant Roman presence far from the center 
of administration. Sculpture and painting abounded within public 
and private buildings. Often sculpture carried a strong political 
message, its style chosen to best reinforce its content. As with 
architecture, an abstract style came to dominate sculpture in late 
antiquity, due perhaps to a change in concepts of rulership and an 
increased spirituality.

Early Jewish, 
Early Christian, 
and Byzantine Art 


T he late roman empire was home to a vast melting pot of 

creeds—including the ancient faith of Judaism, as well as Christianity, 
Mithraism, Manichaeism, and Gnosticism, to name a few. These 
competing faiths shared several features, including an emphasis on 
divine revelation through a chief prophet or messiah and the hope of salvation. Of 


these religions, Christianity became the most widespread and 
influential. The art, principally Jewish and Christian, discussed in 
this chapter reflects the importance of these religions at a time 
when Roman authority waned. The unified political structure that 
Rome had created began to break apart by the fourth century ce, 
with the result that separate imperial centers were established for 
the Western Empire and its eastern counterpart, called the 
Byzantine Empire, each of which developed distinctive forms 
of art. 

The Jews of the Late Roman Empire were a Semitic people 
descended from the ancient Hebrews. The Hebrew people—their 
tradition recounts—arrived in Canaan on the eastern shores of the 
Mediterranean from Egypt around the thirteenth century bce, as 
a result of a long journey chronicled in the Hebrew Bible, the so- 
called Old Testament. They established themselves as a United 
Kingdom of Israel a generation or so before 1000 bce, when 
Jerusalem was made the capital under King David, and it was 
shortly afterward that King Solomon built a Temple there. The 
area was subsequently ruled by a series of foreign occupiers, 
including Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks (under 
Alexander the Great), and, most significantly for our studies, 
Romans, who under General Pompey conquered Israel in 63 bce. 
The Romans referred to this land as Palestine.

Christianity was centered on the life and teaching of Jesus of 
Nazareth, who himself as well as many of his followers came 
from the ranks of the Jews. The religion spread from Palestine, 
first to Greek-speaking communities, notably to Alexandria, in 
Egypt, then reached the Latin-speaking world by the end of the 
second century ce. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and 
John, our principal source of information about Jesus’ life, were 
probably written in the late first century ce, some decades after 
Jesus’ death. The Gospels present him as a historical person and 
as the Son of God and Messiah, or the “Anointed One.” The 
eloquence and significance of Christ’s teachings, the miracles 
attributed to him, and his innate goodness were considered signs 
of his divinity. The Roman authorities, viewing Jesus’ teaching as 
subversive, had him arrested, tried, and ultimately punished and 
executed by crucifixion. As the faith spread, the Romans believed 
Christians threatened the status quo, and intermittently perse¬ 
cuted them. Still, by 300 ce, nearly one-third of Rome was 
Christian, though the new faith had little standing until it gained 
the support of the Emperor Constantine the Great. 

Constantine was battling his fellow tetrarch, Maxentius, for 
control of the Western Empire. According to his biographer, 
Bishop Eusebius of Caeserea, Constantine claimed to have seen a 
sign in the sky in the form of the monogram of Christ, formed by 
the Chi Rho, the first letters of Christ’s name in Greek, and to 
have had a dream in which Christ himself assured him of his vic¬ 
tory over Maxentius, which took place in 312 ce at the Milvian

Bridge in Rome. This is the triumph commemorated by the Arch 
of Constantine (see fig. 7.70). After having consolidated imperial 
power, Constantine promoted Christianity throughout the 
Empire. He began building important religious structures and 
convening Church councils. He claimed that his political author¬ 
ity was granted by God, and placed himself at the head of the 
Church as well as of the state. His choice to accept and promote 
Christianity was a turning point in history, as it resulted in the 
union of Christianity with the legacy of the Roman Empire. The 
character of the Middle Ages—and thus of the rest of European 
history—depended directly on Constantine s decision. 

Constantine also decided to build a new capital for the Roman 
Empire at the strategically located Greek town of Byzantium, 
which was renamed Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). 
Constantine certainly did not anticipate it, but within a century of 
this event, Rome had divided into two halves: an Eastern Empire, 
of which Constantinople was the capital, and a Western Empire 
centered at Rome (see map 8.1). Imperial might and wealth were 
concentrated in Constantinople, enriching and protecting the 
Eastern Empire. In the West, imperial authority was less effective 
in the face of new challenges, as non-Roman groups first invaded 


and then settled. The two empires grew apart, in their institutions 
and in the practice of their common faith. 

Into the vacuum of power left by the decline of imperial 
institutions in the West stepped the Bishop of Rome. Deriving 
his authority from St. Peter, the Pope, as the Bishop of Rome 
became known, claimed to be the head of the universal Christian 
Church, although his Eastern counterpart, the patriarch of 
Constantinople, disputed this claim. Differences in doctrine 
and liturgy continued to develop until eventually the division 
of Christendom into a Western or Catholic Church and an 
Eastern or Orthodox Church became all but final. The Great 
Schism, or final break, between the two churches occurred in the 
eleventh century. 

The religious separation of East and West profoundly affected 
the development of Christian art in the Late Roman Empire. 
“Early Christian” does not, strictly speaking, designate a style. It 
refers, rather, to any work of art produced by or for Christians 
during the time prior to the splitting off of the Eastern Church 
from the Western Church: that is, roughly during the first five 
centuries after the birth of Jesus. “Byzantine,” on the other hand, 
designates not only the art of the Eastern Roman Empire but also 


236 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 
















its specific culture and style, which was linked to the imperial 
court of Constantinople. 

Both Early Christian and Byzantine, and to some extent early 
Jewish, art have their origins in Rome, and at various moments 
classical style is preserved or revived. But the art forms of Early 
Christian art differ from those of the Greek and Roman world. 
Whereas the ancients expressed the physical presence of their 
gods in naturalistic sculpture and paintings, Early Christian artists 
explored a different vision. In the service of their new faith, they 
concentrated on symbolic representation, using physical means to 
express a spiritual essence. Early Christian art refined the increas¬ 
ingly stylized and abstracted art forms of the Late Roman Empire 
into a visual language that could express both profoundly spiri¬ 
tual and unmistakably secular power. 

This culture of Christianity—shaped by Rome, by migrations 
of northern European peoples, and by Christian faith and institu¬ 
tions—lasted a thousand years. Later historians, looking back from 
the Renaissance, when Roman forms were deliberately being 
revived, called this civilization medieval; they saw the Middle Ages 
as an epoch between themselves and the ancient world. (The term 
“medieval” is derived from the Latin medium aevum , and is thus 
a synonym for the Middle Ages.) The chronological limits of the 
Middle Ages are somewhat fluid, but for many historians, the vic¬ 
tory of Constantine the Great in 312 marks the beginning of the 
Middle Ages, while the Renaissance in the 1400s marks its end. 

EARLY JEWISH ART 

The art of a variety of religions and by a range of peoples contin¬ 
ued to be produced during the Late Roman Empire. Indeed, the 
relationships among these various religious arts make clear that 


none of them was produced in a vacuum and that each affected 
the others. Of particular interest is Jewish art, both as a subject 
worthy of study in its own right and because its development is 
acutely intertwined with that of Christian art, establishing 
connections nearly as profound as are the relationships between 
the two religions themselves. The artistic influences, perhaps 
better-termed “dependencies,” between the two religions go both 
ways: Each seems to have been interested in and stimulated by the 
artistic production of the other. At the same time, both Jewish 
and Christian art developed within an environment where the 
dominant artistic force was clearly Roman. 

DURA-EUROPOS SYNAGOGUE Discoveries in Palestine and 
other neighboring regions within the last century have forced 
scholars to revise their estimation of the quantity and quality of 
Jewish art produced in antiquity. Central to this reevaluation was 
the fortuitous and remarkable discovery of a synagogue in the 
Syrian town of Dura-Europos, a Roman outpost on the upper 
Euphrates. In 256 ce, in order to protect itself from imminent 
attack by Persians, the town strengthened its protective walls, 
which involved filling in some adjacent streets in order to form a 
defensive bunker. Buried as a result, and thus preserved, were a 
number of buildings, including a shrine to Mithras (worshiped in 
Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Persia), a Jewish syna¬ 
gogue, and a house that was used for Christian rituals. These 
buildings were excavated in the late 1920s and early 1930s. 

The bench-lined sanctuary of the Dura-Europos synagogue 
(fig. 8.1) would have seated about 120 people. It was decorated 
with painted ceiling tiles and with four registers of tempera paint¬ 
ings on its walls, more than half of which have survived. The 
mural paintings illustrate episodes from the Hebrew Bible, 
including scenes featuring Moses and other patriarchs and

prophets. The synagogue was rebuilt or refurbished in 245 and 
246, just a decade before the defenses against Persian attack were 
raised; as such, it was virtually new when buried. A niche in 
the center of the Jerusalem-facing west wall housed a shrine for 
the Torah, the parchment scroll containing the first five books of 
the Hebrew Bible. The shrine is decorated with a representation 
of a temple and a menorah, the seven-branched candelabrum that 
was housed in the Second Temple in Jerusalem, the center of 
Jewish worship and ritual for centuries, which was destroyed by 
the Romans in 70 ce (see page 209 and fig. 7.37). The message— 
one confirmed by writings by rabbis, those Jewish religious lead¬ 
ers and teachers who became increasingly important after the 
first century ce —is that the synagogues in which Jews practice 
their religion are to be equated with the Temple in Jerusalem. 
Indeed, the synagogue was the place where many rituals, for 
example, the blowing of the ram’s horn (the shofar ), historically 
practiced in the Temple, came to be performed. Prayers offered in 
the synagogue substituted for sacrifices that originally took place 
in the Temple. 

The Dura-Europos paintings were created in a space that 
served a ritual function, where the practice of the liturgy, a body 
of rites prescribed for public worship, was consistent and alive. To 
some extent, the decoration of this synagogue provides both a set¬ 
ting for, and a reflection of, ceremonial performance by the local 
community. In addition to wall murals, ritual objects, and other 


decorations, the sounds of prayer and the aroma of incense 
embellished the synagogue and accentuated the sense of a charged 
space created for the enactment of the liturgy. 

Previous to the discovery of the Dura-Europos wall paintings, 
it had traditionally been assumed that Jews rarely produced art, a 
notion based on the biblical proscription against making graven 
images as described in the Second Commandment (Exodus 
20:4-6; Deuteronomy 5:8-10: “You shall not make to you any 
graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, 
or that is in the earth beneath....You shall not bow down yourself 
to them, nor serve them”). While the Dura-Europos paintings are 
the most extensive figural body of early Jewish art to survive, 
early writings by rabbis specifically mention the existence of 
mural programs in third-century ce Palestine and, as we shall see, 
synagogue decorations survive there in some number. 
Representations of God do not appear in Jewish contexts, and it 
is here that we should understand the significance of the edict 
against the production of graven images. The Second 
Commandment was not an injunction against representation, but 
rather, more specifically against making idols. 

Although the Dura-Europos wall paintings would not have 
been unique in their own time, the lack of surviving comparable 
material makes any attempt to see a systematic program of images 
far from secure, and some scholars claim that there was in fact 
none. One suggestion is that the scenes could have been used by

238 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 
























preachers as illustrations for their sermons, turning from one to 
the other as appropriate. However, others have argued that the 
scenes selected for illustration emphasize the Lords special 
covenant with the chosen people of Israel; still others have noted 
the concentration of scenes, for example those in which Moses 
and the prophets Elijah and Ezekiel figure, that offer the promise 
of revival in both a personal and a messianic sense. This message 
of redemption is reinforced by the identification of the synagogue 
with the Temple in Jerusalem. 

The Dura-Europos west-wall panel of the Consecration of the 
Tabernacle (fig. 8.2) illustrates details mentioned in the Hebrew 
Bible, in various chapters of Exodus and in Numbers 7:89-8:2, 
which chronicle the creation and consecration of a portable tent 
used during the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt and that housed 
the Ark of the Covenant, the chest in which Moses placed the 
tablets containing the Ten Commandments, the foundation of 
Jewish law that God delivered to him on the journey from Egypt. 
The Tabernacle, described in the Bible as tentlike and composed 
of poles and goat s-hair curtains, is here a Roman temple (see figs. 
7.2 and 7.44) surrounded by a defensive wall pierced by three por¬ 
tals. It is not clear whether the permanent building represented 
here, rather than the portable tent described in the Bible, is a 
result of scriptural interpretation, or whether it perhaps reflects 
concern on the part of the population of a frontier town for secu¬ 
rity and defense; it might also replicate a pictorial source relied 
upon by the artist. 

The golden menorah (described in Exodus 25:31-40) is placed 
in front of the temple and below the Ark of the Covenant, which 
bears a strong resemblance to the Dura-Europos Torah-shrine 
niche. The attendant and the red heifer in the lower left-hand 
corner are derived from Roman scenes of animal sacrifice; hence, 
they show remnants of foreshortening that are not found among 
the other figures. Other echoes of Roman painting appear in 
the perspective view of the altar table next to the figure of 
Aaron, the first Jewish high priest, whose name, interestingly, is 
inscribed in Greek. Most of the rest of the scenes reveal little 
interest in either light or space in the Roman sense. The spatial 
sequence of objects and people is conveyed by other means. The 
menorah, the two incense burners on either side of it, the altar, 
and Aaron are to be seen as behind, rather than on top of, the 
wall in vertical perspective. Their size, however, is based on their 
importance, not on their position in space. Aaron, as the main 
figure, is not only larger than the attendants but also more 
abstract. Because of its ritual meaning, his costume is shown in 
detail, at the cost of the body underneath. The attendants, on the 
other hand, show some mobility and three-dimensional form. 
Their garments, surprisingly, are Persian, a sign of the mixture of 
civilizations and the melting-pot conditions in this border area. 
In terms of style, the synagogue paintings should be seen in the 
context of the developing abstraction of later Roman art (see figs. 
7.67 and 7.72). 

The west-wall mural, then, combines a variety of elements that 
suggest that the ritual being performed is timeless and recurring. 
The mural depicts an event of great religious importance: the 


consecration of the Tabernacle and its priests. We can read the 
details—animals, human beings, buildings, cult objects—without 
trouble, but their relationship to one another is not clear. There 
is no action, no story, only an assembly of forms and figures, 
which, however, the synagogue members would have been able 
to link together. 

HAMMATH TIBERIAS SYNAGOGUE In addition to wall 
paintings and liturgical objects, a number of synagogues, particu¬ 
larly in Palestine, were decorated with floor mosaics. The fourth- 
century mosaic floor of a synagogue at Hammath Tiberias (fig. 
8.3) on the shore of the Sea of Galilee contains motifs that are 
typical of synagogue pavements, including a wheel with the signs 
of the zodiac between its spokes and in the center a representation 
of Helios, the Greek sun-god, bearing a staff and globe, with rays 
emanating from his head and riding a quadriga, a two-wheeled 
chariot drawn by four horses. Scholars have debated this reliance 
on the art of another culture for sources of imagery; some see it as 
a formal borrowing without overt concern for meaning, while

others recognize a desire to transfer the authority of traditional 
pagan images to a new context. 

In the corners between the circle of the zodiac and the square 
frame that encloses it are representations of the seasons, while 
below the zodiac panel, two lions flank an inscription in Greek 
that praises the synagogue’s builders and describes the donation 
of precious metals to the synagogue, referred to as a “holy place. ” 
A number of Palestinian synagogue mosaics took the zodiac as 
their central feature: This might be related to the Jews’ sense of 
themselves as distinctive in part because of their use of a calendar 
different from those of other peoples. The zodiac undoubtedly 
refers as well to Gods creation of the universe. 

Represented above the zodiac is a Torah shrine, framed by 
menorahs and other ritual objects, including incense shovels and 
the shofar , as well as a tied bundle of palm, willow, and myrtle 
branches (the lulav) and citrons ( etrogs ), used in the harvest festi¬ 
val, all elements from the liturgy. The mosaic of the ark and meno- 
rah panel was placed facing Jerusalem, in front of the raised 
podium where the actual Torah shrine was located. The mosaic at 
Hammath Tiberias creates and unifies sacred time and sacred space. 

The mosaic’s style of representation is reminiscent of Roman 
mosaic work (see fig. 7.15). The figures’ modeling is subtle and 
shadows suggest solid, if squat, bodies. Some scholars have cited 
the fact that the nude figures of Libra and Gemini are uncircum¬ 
cised as evidence for the Jewish resistance to making images, sug¬ 
gesting that the artists responsible for these works were Gentiles. 
But at other sites inscriptions identify the mosaicists as Jewish, and 
it is more probable, given the long history of the representation of 
the zodiac, that this detail reflects pictorial sources rather than any 
comment, conscious or otherwise, by the makers of the mosaic. 

The Hebrew and Greek used in the mosaic—and there are 
inscriptions in Aramaic (a Semitic language) as well—reflect the 
fact that multiple traditions are at work here. Indeed, although the 
images at Hammath Tiberias and at Dura-Europos have special 
relevance to Jewish history, beliefs, and rituals, many reflect 
Graeco-Roman content, even if it was Judaized in accordance 
with the special concerns and needs of the communities the 
images served. A similar pattern is also evident in the develop¬ 
ment of the earliest Christian art. 

EARLY CHRISTIAN ART 

Christian Art before Constantine 

We do not know when or where the first Christian works of art 
were produced. None of the surviving paintings or sculptures can 
be dated to earlier than about 200 ce. In fact, we know little about 
Christian art before the reign of Constantine the Great. This is 
hardly accidental. It is in Rome that we have the greatest concen¬ 
tration of the earliest surviving works, yet before Constantine, 
Rome was not the center of the faith. Older and larger Christian 
communities existed in the great cities of North Africa and the 
Near East, such as Alexandria and Antioch, but we only have 


hints of what Christian places of worship there and in centers 
such as Syria and Palestine might have looked like. 

THE ART OF THE CATACOMBS The painted decoration of 
the Roman catacombs, underground burial places, is the only 
sizable body of material we have from which to study the earliest 
Christian art. The burial rite and the safeguarding of the tomb 
were of vital concern to early Christians, whose faith rested on 
salvation, the hope of eternal life in paradise. As such, paintings in 
catacombs tell us a good deal about the spirit of the communities 
that commissioned them. 

The ceiling of one of the more elaborate chambers in the cata¬ 
comb of Santissimi Pietro e Marcellino in Rome (fig. 8.4) is deco¬ 
rated in a style that is at once formal and uncomplicated. Fixed 
borders control the overall organization; a central medallion or 
circle contains the figure of a shepherd, who is flanked by sheep 
and carries a lamb across his shoulders. The circle is connected to 
four lunettes (semicircular spaces), and in the four corners are 
single figures with outstretched, raised arms. The style of painting 
reflects Roman murals, both in the landscape settings and in the 
use of linear devices to divide the scenes into compartments (see 
figs. 7.55 and 7.56). But the representations seem sketchier, less 
grounded in natural observation than their Roman relatives. The 
differences are partly due to the nature of the subterranean spaces, 
their use, and their meaning. 

Catacombs would have been used only occasionally beyond 
the actual circumstance of burial, perhaps for a commemorative 
celebration. This is probably one reason why the wall paintings 
do not show much detail and care of execution. One imagines as 
well that artists of the first rank would have chosen more salubri¬ 
ous locations in which to work. Another reason for the sketchi¬ 
ness of these paintings is that their primary value is symbolic. 
Consistent with the biblical prohibition against image making, as 
specified in the Second Commandment, Christ is generally not 
represented in the catacombs, except by metaphor. The shepherd 
with a sheep on his shoulder is a potent allusion to Christ, since 
in a number of biblical accounts Christ refers to himself as the 
Good Shepherd, concerned for the well-being of his flock and 
willing to sacrifice himself in order to guarantee the salvation of 
those who follow him (Luke 15:4-6; John 10:1-18). This Good 
Shepherd metaphor also builds on references in the Hebrew 
Bible, as in Psalm 23: 

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

He makes me to lie down in green pastures: 

he leads me beside the still waters. 

He restores my soul... 

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 

all the days of my life: 

and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. 

This correlation between New Testament and Hebrew Bible 
reflects the fact that many of the converts to the new faith 
were Jewish. 


240 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 



The Life of Jesus 

Events in the life of Jesus, from his birth through his ascension to 
Heaven, are traditionally grouped in cycles, each with numerous 
episodes. The scenes most frequently depicted in European art are 
presented here. 

Incarnation Cycle and The Childhood of Jesus 

These episodes concern Jesus ’ conception, birth, infancy, and youth. 
Annunciation The archangel Gabriel tells Mary that she will bear 
God’s son. The Holy Spirit, shown usually as a dove, represents the 
Incarnation, the miraculous conception. 

Visitation The pregnant Mary visits her older cousin Elizabeth, who 
is to bear John the Baptist and who is the first to recognize the divine 
nature of the baby Mary is carrying. 

Nativity At the birth of Jesus, the Holy Family—Mary, his foster 
father, Joseph, and the Christ Child—is usually depicted in a stable or, 
in Byzantine representations, in a cave. 

Annunciation to the Shepherds and Adoration of the Shepherds 

An angel announces the birth of Jesus to shepherds in the field at night. 
The shepherds then go to the birthplace to pay homage to the child. 
Adoration of the Magi The Magi, wise men from the East (called the 
Three Kings in the Middle Ages), follow a bright star for 1 2 days until 
they find the Holy Family and present their gifts to Jesus. 
Presentation in the Temple Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus 
to the Temple in Jerusalem, where Simeon, a devout man, and Anna, a 
prophetess, foresee Jesus’ messianic mission (his mission as Savior) 
and martyr’s death. 

Massacre of the Innocents and Flight into Egypt King Herod 
orders all male children under the age of two in and around Bethlehem 
to be killed in order to preclude his being murdered by a rival newborn 
king spoken of in a prophecy. The Holy Family flees to Egypt. 

Public Ministry Cycle 

These accounts of Jesus’ public career include his gathering of disci¬ 
ples, his preaching, and the performance of miracles. 

Baptism John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the Jordan River, recogniz¬ 
ing his incarnation as the Son of God. This marks the beginning of 
Jesus’ ministry. 

Calling of Matthew The tax collector Matthew becomes Jesus’ first 
disciple (apostle) when Jesus calls to him, “Follow me.” 

Jesus Walking on the Water During a storm, Jesus walks on the 
water of the Sea of Galilee to reach his apostles in a boat. 

Raising of Lazarus Jesus brings his friend Lazarus back to life four 
days after his death and burial. 

Delivery of the Keys to Peter Jesus names the apostle Peter as his 
successor by giving him the “keys” to the Kingdom of Heaven. 
Transfiguration As Jesus’ closest disciples watch, God transforms 
Jesus into a dazzling vision and proclaims him to be his own son. 
Cleansing the Temple Jesus clears the Temple in Jerusalem of 
money-changers and animal traders. 

Passion Cycle 

The Passion (from passio, Latin for “suffering”) cycle relates Jesus’ 
death, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to heaven. 


Entry into Jerusalem Welcomed by crowds as the Messiah, Jesus 
triumphantly rides an ass into the city of Jerusalem. 

Last Supper At the Passover seder, Jesus tells his disciples of his 
impending death and lays the foundation for the Christian rite of the 
Eucharist: the taking of bread and wine in remembrance of Christ. 
(Strictly speaking, Jesus is called Jesus until he leaves his earthly phys¬ 
ical form, after which he is called Christ.) 

Jesus Washing the Disciples’ Feet Following the Last Supper, Jesus 
washes the feet of his disciples to demonstrate humility. 

Agony in the Garden In Gethsemane, the disciples sleep while Jesus 
wrestles with his mortal dread of suffering and dying. 

Betrayal (Arrest) The disciple Judas Iscariot takes money to identify 
Jesus to Roman soldiers. Jesus is arrested. 

Denial of Peter As Jesus predicted, Peter, waiting outside the high 
priest’s palace, denies knowing Jesus three times as Jesus is being 
questioned by the high priest Caiaphas. 

Jesus before Pilate Jesus is questioned by the Roman governor 
Pontius Pilate regarding whether or not he calls himself King of the 
Jews. Jesus does not answer. Pilate reluctantly condemns him. 
Flagellation (Scourging) Jesus is whipped by Roman soldiers. 

Jesus Crowned with Thorns (The Mocking of Christ) Pilate’s sol¬ 
diers mock Jesus by dressing him in robes, crowning him with thorns, 
and calling him King of the Jews. 

Carrying of the Cross (Road to Calvary) Jesus carries the wooden 
Cross on which he will be executed from Pilate’s house to the hill of 
Golgotha, which means “the place of the skull.” 

Crucifixion Jesus is nailed to the Cross by his hands and feet, and 
dies after great physical suffering. 

Descent from the Cross (Deposition) Jesus’ followers lower his 
body from the Cross and wrap it for burial. Also present are the Virgin 
Mary, the apostle John, and, in some accounts, Mary Magdalen. 
Lamentation (Piet a or Vesperbild ) The grief-stricken followers 
gather around Jesus’ body. In the Pieta, his body lies in the lap of the 
Virgin. 

Entombment The Virgin Mary and others place the wrapped body in 
a sarcophagus, or rock tomb. 

Descent into Limbo (Harrowing of Hell or Anastasis in the 
Orthodox Church) Christ descends to Hell, or Limbo, to free deserv¬ 
ing souls who have not heard the Christian message—the prophets of 
the Hebrew Bible, the kings of Israel, and Adam and Eve. 
Resurrection Christ rises from the dead on the third day after his 
entombment. 

The Marys at the Tomb As terrified soldiers look on, Christ’s female 
followers (the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalen, and Mary, mother of the 
apostle James the Greater) discover the empty tomb. 

Noli Me Tangere, Supper at Emmaus, and the Doubting of 
Thomas In three episodes during the 40 days between his resurrec¬ 
tion and ascent into Heaven, Christ tells Mary Magdalen not to touch 
him (Noli me tangere), shares a supper with his disciples at Emmaus, 
and invites the apostle Thomas to touch the lance wound in his side. 
Ascension As his disciples watch, Christ is taken into Heaven from 
the Mount of Olives.

The four lunettes around the Good Shepherd form a cycle 
dedicated to the Hebrew prophet Jonah. (See In forming Art , page 
273.) Here, too, the symbolic references to Christian beliefs about 
Christ are clear: Just as it is a principle of faith that Jonah spent 
three days within the belly of the whale, so Christ is supposed to 
have spent three days in the tomb, and just as Jonah was released 
with unharmed body, so Christ was resurrected from his tomb in 
physical wholeness. Indeed, in Matthew 12:40 Christ compares 
himself to Jonah. Recent converts would probably have felt com¬ 
fortable knowing that didactic aspects of their old faith could find 
a sympathetic response in the new religion. Jonah s story is pre¬ 
sented as a prefiguration (foreseeing) of events in Christ s life, 
thus assigning the Hebrew Bible story the role of prophecy and 
the Christian Bible one of its fulfillment. As Christian thinkers 
increasingly analyzed the prophetic relationship of the Hebrew 
Bible to the Christian one, they developed a virtual system of 
concordances, called typology, that was to have far-reaching 
significance. 

The painted ceiling in the Santissimi Pietro e Marcellino cata¬ 
comb also borrows imagery from classical sources. The Good 
Shepherd himself is a reminder of pagan symbols of charity in the 


form of ancient sculptures of men carrying sacrificial animals on 
their shoulders. The posture of Jonah, reclining under the gourd 
bush, benefiting from Gods beneficence, derives from Roman 
pagan mythological representations of Endymion, a youth so 
beautiful that he was rewarded with eternal sleep. So, as with their 
Jewish counterparts, former practitioners of pagan religions who 
had converted to Christianity would also have been familiar with 
some of the images and ideas expressed in Early Christian art. 

Both the Good Shepherd and Jonah are associated with mes¬ 
sages of comfort, reminding us that Early Christian art developed 
during the turmoil of Romes decline, a time of political, social, 
and economic instability. The allure of the new religion must have 
been profound indeed, suggesting that things of this world were 
of less significance than those of a future world, which offered the 
hope of eternal peace. The four standing figures between the 
lunettes are orants (worshipers), represented in what had long 
been the standard pose of prayer, signifying the virtues of faith 
and piety that make personal salvation possible. 

One might question the extent to which the Christian use of 
pagan and Jewish subjects had a political agenda. After all, on 
some level, to borrow forms from other cultures and religions and 


242 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 








to use them for new purposes are acts of appropriation. By adopt¬ 
ing forms used by an older, more established culture, Christians 
expressed their ambition to dominate that culture—indeed, to 
supplant it. Such appropriation becomes more systematic as the 
new religion of Christianity becomes increasingly powerful. 

SCULPTURE Sculpture seems to have played a secondary role in 
Early Christian art. The biblical prohibition on graven images was 
thought to apply with particular force to large cult statues, idols 
worshiped in pagan temples. In order to avoid the taint of 
idolatry, therefore, Christian sculpture had to shun life-size 
representations of the human figure. Sculpture thus developed in 
an antimonumental direction: away from the spatial depth, 
naturalism, and massive scale of Graeco-Roman sculpture and 
toward shallow, small-scale forms and lacelike surface decoration. 

The earliest works of Christian sculpture are sarcophagi, stone 
coffins, which from the middle of the third century on were pro¬ 
duced for the more important members of the Church. They 
evolved from the pagan examples that had replaced cinerary urns 
in Roman society around the time of Hadrian. Before 
Constantine, their decoration consisted mostly of a repertory of 
familiar themes from the catacombs. Examples of these can be 
seen on the marble sarcophagus of the mid-third century from 
Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome (fig. 8.5). On the left are scenes fea¬ 
turing Jonah: the ship, the sea monster, and the reclining prophet. 
Jonahs well-chiseled anatomy and the elegance of his pose 
remind us of the classical sources that must have served as a model 
for the artist. So, too, the Good Shepherd, though stylized, 
reminds of us of classical statuary in that he is able to distribute 


weight well enough to manage with some comfort the burden of 
the sheep he carries. Again, the orant in the center, with hands 
upraised in prayer, is a subject we have seen in catacomb painting. 
The seated figure holding a scroll derives from antique represen¬ 
tations of writers or philosophers and is another of the 
metaphoric references to Christ, in this case to his role as teacher. 
On the right is a scene of baptism. The figure being baptized may 
be Christ himself. If so, this might indicate an increased move¬ 
ment toward narrative, since baptism was an event in the life of 
Jesus (see Informing Art , page 241), and a willingness to represent 
him directly. On the other hand, the figure appears to be generic, 
nonindividualized, virtually childlike in its proportions. This 
generic representation could be a result of both a fear of making 
an idolatrous image and an interest in expressing the more essen¬ 
tial nature of the scene, from which a portrait of the person of 
Christ would detract. 

THE HOUSE CHURCH Although we have little archaeological 
evidence of the places where Early Christians gathered, literary 
accounts, including biblical references, suggest that Christians 
met regularly to celebrate their shared belief in Christ as the 
Son of God and Savior and to observe some type of Eucharist, or 
spiritual union, with him by the partaking of consecrated bread 
and wine (representing Christ s flesh and blood) in remembrance 
of the Last Supper, at which Jesus and his disciples enjoyed a 
final communal meal. Such gatherings of Christians probably 
originally took place in private homes, which were only later 
replaced by public spaces designed specifically for Christian 
worship. This situation is perhaps to be expected, both because

The Book of the Popes 
(Liber Pontificalis) 



From the Life of Pope Sylvester I 

This text is an o fficial history of the Roman papacy from St. Peter (died 
ca. 64 CE) to the twelfth century Its biographies of the early popes were 
compiled from archival documents. What follows, for example, is a list 
of gifts to Old St. Peter's by Emperor Constantine in the time of Pope 
Sylvester I (314-335 CE). Lavish imperial donations such as these set a 
standard that subsequent popes and other prelates continued to match. 

C onstantine Augustus built the basilica of blessed Peter, the apos¬ 
tle, and laid there the coffin with the body of the holy Peter; the 


coffin itself he enclosed on all sides with bronze. Above he set por¬ 
phyry columns for adornment and other spiral columns which he 
brought from Greece. He made a vaulted apse in the basilica, gleam¬ 
ing with gold, and over the body of the blessed Peter, above the 
bronze which enclosed it, he set a cross of purest gold. He gave also 
4 brass candlesticks, 10 feet in height, overlaid with silver, with fig¬ 
ures in silver of the acts of the apostles, 3 golden chalices, 20 silver 
chalices, 2 golden pitchers, 5 silver pitchers, a golden paten with a tur¬ 
ret of purest gold and a dove, a golden crown before the body, that is 
a chandelier, with 50 dolphins, 32 silver lamps in the basilica, with 
dolphins, for the right of the basilica 30 silver lamps, the altar itself of 
silver overlaid with gold, adorned on every side with gems, 400 in 
number, a censer of purest gold adorned on every side with jewels.

Christianity was something of an underground religion and 
because other religions also seem to have used private houses as 
gathering places; for instance, the Villa of the Mysteries in 
Pompeii (see fig. 7.53). 

The same defensive barrier that preserved the Dura-Europos 
synagogue (see page 237) also buried what must have been a 
traditional Christian meeting place. The house is in most ways 
a typical two-story Roman domus. A large room opened onto the 
atrium and would have served as a community assembly room, 
while another space, judging by a font that takes up an entire wall 
of the room (fig. 8.6), was apparently reserved for baptism, the 
rite whereby Christians are initiated into the religion by virtue of 


being sprinkled or immersed in water. The font is covered by a 
stone canopy, and frescoed scenes decorate the lunette on the end 
wall under the canopy and also the side walls. Some of the sub¬ 
jects represented are familiar: In the lunette is a Good Shepherd 
balancing a sheep on his shoulders with his flock before him, and, 
at the bottom left, now barely visible, are figures of Adam and 
Eve. Represented on the side wall are three women holding 
candles who proceed toward a stone sarcophagus. This scene 
represents the three Marys at the Tomb (see Informing Art , page 
241), who, when approaching the tomb of Christ (as described in 
Matthew 28:1-10), meet an angel who tells them that the tomb is 
empty because the entombed Christ has risen.

244 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 
















The representations on the wall of the Dura-Europos house 
can be connected with those found in Early Christian catacombs 
and on sarcophagi through shared imagery, such as the depictions 
of the Good Shepherd and Adam and Eve. Such images indicate a 
general concern with issues of death and retribution, resurrection 
and salvation. The inclusion here of Adam and Eve reminds the 
viewer of the Original Sin, committed by Adam and passed from 
one generation to the next, from which humankind will be 
redeemed as a result of Christ s sacrificial death and his resurrec¬ 
tion, which the scene of the Marys visiting his empty tomb 
emphasizes. The association of these funerary subjects with 
baptism was a logical pairing for Christians, who view baptism as 
a rebirth into the new faith, just as they see physical death as a 
rebirth into everlasting life. Even when artists were experimenting 
with how best to depict entirely new subject matter, those respon¬ 
sible for its creation, whether artists or patrons, applied an over¬ 
whelming conceptual consistency to Christian art during the first 
several centuries of the Christian era. This was perhaps a result of 
the new religion s need for didactic representations that could be 
readily understood. 

Christians in other areas of the Empire also used the type of 
the domus ecclesiae , or house church, seen at Dura-Europus. In 
Rome itself we know of 25 private houses—and undoubtedly 
there were more—reserved as places of Christian worship, 
although most of them were destroyed by the later building of 
churches on their sites. 


Christian Art afier Official Recognition 
o fChristianity 

The building of churches on the sites of what once were private 
houses used for Christian worship reflects a change in the status 
of Christianity during the fourth century from an alternative 
religion to an official religion endorsed by the emperor 
Constantine. Almost overnight, an impressive architectural set¬ 
ting had to be created for the new official faith, so that the Church 
might be visible to all. Constantine himself devoted the full 
resources of his office to this task. Within a few years, an aston¬ 
ishing number of large, imperially sponsored churches arose, not 
only in Rome but also in Constantinople, in the Holy Land, and 
at other important sites. 

THE CHRISTIAN BASILICA The most important 
Constantinian church structures were a type of basilica, and this 
form provided the basic model for the development of church 
architecture in Western Europe. The Early Christian basilica owes 
its essential features to imperial basilicas, such as the Basilica 
Ulpia (see fig. 7.17). As with the imperial basilicas, it is character¬ 
ized by a long nave flanked by side aisles and lit by clerestory 
windows in the upper part of the wall, with an apse (though only 
at one end) and a trussed wooden roof. The Roman basilica was 
a suitable model since it combined the spacious interior needed to 
accommodate a large number of people with (perhaps most 
important) imperial associations that proclaimed the privileged 


status of Christianity. As the largely civil functions of the Roman 
basilica were quite different from its new uses as a house of 
worship, the Roman-style basilica had to be redesigned to 
acknowledge these changes. Therefore, the longitudinal plan of 
the basilica was given a new focus: the altar placed in front of the 
semicircular apse, normally at the eastern end of the nave. The 
significance of the altar s placement in the east, where the sun 
rises, reminds us that Christian art, like that of Judaism (see page 
240), inherited many divine attributes from other religions. In this 
case, Christ shares an imagery with the Roman god Apollo, in his 
manifestation as sun-god. 

The greatest Constantinian church was Old St. Peter s Basilica 
in Rome (figs. 8.7 and 8.8). It was torn down and replaced by the

present St. Peter s Basilica, in the Vatican, during the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries, but its appearance is preserved in a seven¬ 
teenth-century album of copies of earlier drawings (fig. 8.9), and 
there are literary descriptions as well. Together these sources give 
us a clear idea of the original plan for the church. Begun as early 
as 319 and finished by 329, Old St. Peter s was built on the Vatican 
Hill next to a pagan burial ground. It stood directly over the 
grave of St. Peter, which was marked by a shrine covered with a 
baldacchino, a canopy that designates a place of honor. As such, 
Old St. Peter s served as the apostle s martyrium, a building that 
housed sacred relics or the remains of a holy person. The location 
of St. Peter s burial spot was the focus of the church, and due to 
site restrictions, its apse was at the west end of the church, an 
unusual feature. Rituals were conducted from a portable altar 
placed before the shrine, using gold and silver implements 
donated by the emperor himself. (See Primary Source , page 244.) 

To enter the church, the congregation first crossed a colon¬ 
naded court, the atrium, which was added toward the end of the 
fourth century; this feature derived from the Roman basilica. 
Congregants then passed through the narthex, an entrance hall, 
into the church itself. The steady rhythm of the nave colonnade 
would have pulled them toward the triumphal arch that 
separates the nave from the apse, which it also serves to frame. 
The shrine stood at the junction of the nave and the transept, a 
separate space placed perpendicular to the nave and aisles. Spaces 
at the end of the transept, marked off by columns, might have 
served to prepare items used during church rites and to hold 
offerings brought by the faithful. 

The main focus of Christian liturgy was, and is, the Mass, 
which includes the sacrament of Communion, the symbolic 


reenactment on the altar of Jesus’ sacrifice. The Early Christian 
basilica encouraged attention to the altar, making it the focal point 
of the church by placing it opposite the entrance and at the end of 
a long nave. Even beyond this general emphasis on the altar, Old 
St. Peter s gave special prominence to the altar zone through its 
special, additional function as a martyrium. 

Although today we think of the practice of religion as an open 
one, in the early Church only those who had proven themselves 
Christians could witness the complete performance of the liturgy. 
It was through baptism that catechumens, those receiving instruc¬ 
tion in preparation for their initiation into the new religion, 
became full-fledged Christians. Before baptism, they could hear, 
but not see, parts of the Mass. Even today Christians refer to this 
as the “mystery” of the Mass. 

CENTRAL-PLAN STRUCTURES Buildings of round or 
polygonal shape capped by a dome entered the tradition of 
Christian architecture in Constantine s time. Roman emperors 
had built similar structures to serve as monumental tombs or 
mausoleums, such as the one Diocletian had built for himself at 
his palace at Spalato (see fig. 7.63). Not surprisingly therefore, the 
Early Christian central-plan building was often associated with 
funerary functions, as was Santa Costanza, in Rome, the mau¬ 
soleum of Constantine s daughter Constantia (figs. 8.10 and 8.11). 
Built over a catacomb, it was originally attached to the now- 
ruined basilican church of Sant’Agnese fuori le mura (St. Agnes 
Outside the Walls). The focus of the building is on the central 
space, illuminated by clerestory windows, over which rises a 
dome supported by twelve pairs of columns. Four of the arches of 
this colonnade stand slightly higher than the others and suggest a

cross inscribed within a circle. The significance of the cross in a 
funerary context results from its association with Christ, who, 
though martyred on a cross, rose victorious over death. The 
Cross was meaningful to all Christians but particularly to the 
family of Constantine, whose personal conversion was a result of 
his vision of the Cross, which had signaled his victory at the 
Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. The sarcophagus of 
Constantia was originally placed under the eastern, more-elevated 
arch. Encircling the building is an ambulatory, a ring-shaped 
aisle, covered by a barrel vault (see fig. 7.3). 

Central-plan and basilican structures are not as different as 
they might first appear. In fact, a section of a central-plan build¬ 
ing parallels a section of a basilican church in that both have a high 
central space with a clerestory flanked by a lower aisle. While the 
basilica plan stretches this form so that emphasis is on the end of 


the building, the central plan, as seen in Santa Costanza, spins the 
section on axis, accentuating the center. You can see this clearly by 
comparing figures 8.9 and 8.11. 

MERGING THE BASILICAN AND CENTRAL PLANS Since 
Constantine continued to follow Roman imperial traditions even 
as he accepted the tenets of Christianity, it is not surprising that 
when he supported the construction of buildings in the Holy 
Land to mark places significant in the life of Jesus, he chose plans 
based on Roman imperial building types, thus accentuating his 
ambitions for his new religion. The basilican Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher (fig. 8.12), in Jerusalem, marked the location where St. 
Helena, mother of Constantine, had found the True Cross (that is, 
the cross on which Jesus was crucified as opposed to those crosses 
on which the thieves who were sentenced to death along with 
Christ were crucified). Beyond the basilica was the Rotunda of 
the Anastasis (Greek for “resurrection”), built over the tomb 
where Christ s body is reputed to have lain for the three days 
before his resurrection. Although the Constantinian building was 
subsequently destroyed and later rebuilt in a somewhat different 
form, this aisled basilica included a gallery, a second story placed 
over the side aisles of a church, increasing the space available for 
the throngs of pilgrims who flocked to key sites. The apse was 
ringed with twelve columns, which Eusebius, Constantine s con¬ 
fidant and biographer, equated with Jesus’ twelve apostles. (See 
Informing Art , page 273.) In the Anastasis rotunda, too, there 
would have been a gallery, but in all other ways this rotunda has 
the same silhouette as Santa Costanza. Both have ambulatories 
formed by columns arranged around a domed central space, 
although unlike Santa Costanza s masonry dome, the dome of the 
Anastasis rotunda was probably made of wood. The similarity of 
form is not surprising. Both were products of the benefaction of 
the imperial family and both served funereal functions. As such, 
their roots in imperial mausoleums are appropriate, even as their 
forms become conveyors of new meaning. The Church of the 
Holy Sepulcher complex shares with Old St. Peter s a desire to 
combine the congregational aspects of a Roman basilica with a 
martyrium in a monument that eulogizes the deceased whom it 
commemorates—Christ himself.

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Mosaics 

M osaics—designs composed of small pieces of colored material set 
in plaster or mortar—had been used by the Sumerians as early as 
the third millennium bce to decorate architectural surfaces. The 
Hellenistic Greeks used pebbles and the Romans, using small cubes of 
marble called tesserae, had refined the technique to the point that it 
could be used to copy paintings, as seen in The Battle of Alexander 
(see fig. 5.78). Although most Roman mosaics were for floors, the 
Romans also produced wall mosaics, but these were usually reserved 
for special purposes, for example in fountain rooms or outdoor spaces 
where fresco would be vulnerable to deterioration. 

The extensive and complex wall mosaics of Early Christian art are 
essentially without precedent. The color scale of Roman mosaics, 
although rich in gradations, lacked brilliance, since it was limited to 
the kinds of colored marble found in nature. Early Christian mosaics, 
by contrast, consist of tesserae made of colored glass, which the 
Romans had known but never fully exploited. Glass tesserae offered 
colors, including gold, of far greater range and intensity than marble 
tesserae. Moreover, the shiny, somewhat irregular faces of glass 
tesserae, each set slightly askew from its neighbor, act as tiny reflec¬ 
tors, so that the overall effect is like a glittering, immaterial screen 
rather than a solid, continuous surface. All these qualities made glass 
mosaic the ideal material for the new architectural aesthetic of Early 
Christian basilicas. 

Glass for tesserae was made by combining sand, soda or potash, 
and lime with metallic oxides, which determined the resultant hues. 
Hardened sheets of glass were marked off and cut into tesserae of 
approximately cubic shape. For gold mosaics, gold leaf was placed on 
a sheet of glass, then glass, still in liquid form, was applied over it and 
heat applied to bond the glass layers, effectively embedding the gold 
leaf within glass. 

The mosaic process was labor-intensive, not only to create the 
design, but also to set the tesserae. Hundreds of thousands of 
tesserae were needed to cover a church interior, and setting them 
required skill and training. The process typically began by applying 


multiple layers of plaster (about 3 inches thick in all) to a wall. Recent 
investigations have shown that mosaics were generally prepared in 
situ. A drawing was done directly on the surface to be decorated, 
which was then painted in order to create a guide for the design. Red 
was used in areas that were to be covered with gold, since red added 
richness to the gold ground. 

Tesserae were then laid into still-fresh plaster, which was suffi¬ 
ciently soft so that at least half the surface of the tesserae could be 
submerged; a secure attachment was thus guaranteed. The process 
required deliberate planning, since only the section of wall that could 
be finished in a day, roughly the time it would take for plaster to 
dry, would receive the final coat of plaster into which the tesserae 
were set. 

Some medieval treatises distinguish between pictores imaqinani 
(mosaic painters) and museurii (mosaic workers), suggesting a hierar¬ 
chy in the division of labor. Under any circumstances, mosaic produc¬ 
tion was a costly enterprise; it has been estimated that it was at least 
four times more expensive than wall painting. Clearly the aesthetic 
advantages of mosaics, as well as their durability, were thought 
sufficient to justify the expense.

ARCHITECTURAL DECORATION: WALL MOSAICS The 

rapid growth of large-scale Christian architecture had a revo¬ 
lutionary effect on Early Christian pictorial art. All of a 
sudden, huge wall surfaces had to be covered with images worthy 
of their monumental framework. Out of this need emerged a 
new art form, the Early Christian wall mosaic, which to a large 
extent replaced the older and cheaper medium of mural 
painting. (See Materials and Technique s, above.) The challenge of 
inventing a body of Christian imagery produced an extraordinary 
creative outpouring. Large pictorial cycles of subjects selected 
from the Hebrew and Christian Bibles were spread over the 
nave walls, the triumphal arch, and the apse. These cycles must 
have drawn on sources that reflected the whole range of 
Graeco-Roman painting as well as artistic traditions that had 
developed in the Christian communities of North Africa and the 
Near East. 


Decoration of fourth-century churches is largely fragmentary 
or known only from literary accounts; it is in fifth-century 
churches that we can see the full development of mosaic¬ 
decorated Christian structures. During the fifth century, the Late 
Empire was threatened at all its borders by migrating tribes. Even 
the capital of the Western Empire at Rome was vulnerable. So the 
emperor Honorius moved it north, first to Milan, and when that 
city was besieged in 402, to Ravenna on the Adriatic coast, 
thought to be more easily defensible than inland sites. 

The Mausoleum of Galla Placidia (fig. 8.13) was named after 
Honorius ’ sister (who ruled the Empire as regent) because it was 
believed that she was buried there, though it is likely that it was 
begun as a chapel dedicated to the martyr St. Lawrence. Its central 
plan takes the form of a Greek cross, that is, a cross with arms of 
equal length. The exterior brick walls of the building, although per¬ 
haps originally covered, were always much simpler than the rich 


248 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 






8.1 3 Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna, Italy. 425-50 ce 


interior (fig. 8.14). Having left the everyday world behind, a visitor 
would encounter a shimmering realm of light and color where pre¬ 
cious marble surfaces and glittering mosaics evoke the spiritual 
splendor of the Kingdom of God. To some extent, the building is 
analogous to the ideal Christian, simple in external body and glorious 
in inner spirit, an analogy certainly not missed by early Christians. 

The barrel vaults and dome of the Mausoleum of Galla 
Placidia are covered with luxurious leaflike decoration and fields 
of stars. Above the vaults, apostles flank a pair of doves and foun¬ 
tains, symbolic of souls drinking from the waters of Paradise. In 
one lunette, St. Lawrence is shown beside the flame-racked grill 
on which he was martyred. A cabinet holding books, identified as 
the four Gospels, reminds us that Lawrence was martyred for 
refusing to surrender the riches of the Church, here represented 
as books, to the Roman authorities. That books would be equated 
with treasure is perhaps not surprising, for, as we shall see, they 
were luxurious objects that played a vital function within the 
Church. The books also remind us that Christians referred to 
themselves as people of the Book, a designation they shared with 
the earlier Hebrew and later Muslim faiths.

8.1 5 Good Shepherd , Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna, Italy. Mosaic 


Another lunette contains a mosaic of the Good Shepherd 
seated in a fully realized landscape (fig. 8.15), expanding the 
central subject of so many catacomb paintings with its more elab¬ 
orate and formal treatment. Here, the Good Shepherd is a young 
man with many attributes adopted from imperial art. His halo 
comes from representations of the emperor as sun-king, and his 
gold robes and purple scarf are traditional signifiers of royal 
stature. These attributes are appropriate to a commission by the 
imperial family, but equally significant is the way formal features 
further the message, and perhaps here there is a paradox. While 
Christ, with realistically modeled face, flowing hair and garments, 
sits comfortably in a lush landscape with a sky-blue background, 
the prevalence of gold denies naturalism to the scene. The paradox 
is that Christ is at once human, imperial, and of this world, and 
yet also beyond it, existing within a glimmering ethereal realm of 
which he is a natural part. Roman mural painting used illusionis- 
tic devices to suggest a reality beyond the surface of the wall (see 
figs. 7.54 and 7.55), whereas Early Christian mosaics used the glit¬ 
ter of gold tesserae to create a luminous realm filled with celestial 
beings, symbols, or narrative action. Thus, Early Christian 
mosaics transform the illusionistic tradition of ancient painting 
with the new Christian message. 

The basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome (fig. 8.16), built 
between 432 and 440, was the first church dedicated to Mary 
begun only a year after she was declared the Theotokos (Greek for 
“the bearer of god”) by the Council of Ephesus. The apse is a later 
replacement, but the general outline of the original building and 


much of the mosaic decoration survive. These mosaics include the 
triumphal arch decoration and more than half of the 42 mosaic 
panels that were placed above the classically inspired entablature 
of the nave colonnade. Pilasters and colonettes framed these pan¬ 
els. Sadly much of this architectural decoration is now missing. 
An enthroned Virgin in the original apse was framed by the 
triumphal arch, which contains stories from Jesus’ infancy—an 
appropriate introduction to Mary because of her involvement in 
those episodes. 

The panels above the nave colonnade illustrate scenes from the 
Hebrew Bible. They combine narration with a concern for struc¬ 
tured symmetry For instance, in the left half of The Parting of Lot 
and Abraham (fig. 8.17), Abraham, his son Isaac, and the rest of 
his family depart for the land of Canaan. On the right, Lot and his 
clan, including his two small daughters, turn toward the city of 
Sodom. The artist who designed this scene from Genesis 13 faced 
the same task as the ancient Roman sculptors of the Column of 
Trajan (see fig. 7.39): He needed to condense complex actions into 
a form that could be read at a distance. In fact, he employed many 
of the same shorthand devices, such as the formulas for house, 
tree, and city and the device of showing a crowd of people as a 
cluster of heads, rather like a bunch of grapes. 

In the Trajanic reliefs, these devices were used only to the 
extent that they allowed the artist to portray actual historical 
events. The mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore, by contrast, depict 
the history of human salvation, beginning with scenes from the 
Hebrew Bible along the nave and ending with the life of Jesus as 


250 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 








8.1 6 Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, Italy, ca. 432-40 ce 


the Messiah on the triumphal arch. For those who read the Bible 
literally, the scheme is not only a historical cycle but also a sym¬ 
bolic program that presents a higher reality—the Word of God. 
Hence, the artist was not concerned with the details of historical 
narrative. Glances and gestures were more important than realis¬ 
tic movement or three-dimensional form. In The Parting of Lot 
and Abraham , the symmetrical composition, with its gap in the 
center, makes clear the significance of this parting: Abraham 
represents the way of righteousness, while Sodom, which was 
destroyed by the Lord, signifies the way of evil. Beneath The 
Parting of Lot and Abraham is a classically inspired but thor¬ 
oughly transformed landscape, its shepherds placed on a green 
ground, while their sheep, as if on little islands, float in gold 
surroundings. 

What were the visual sources of the mosaic compositions at 
Santa Maria Maggiore and other churches like it? These were cer¬ 
tainly not the first depictions of scenes from the Bible. For certain 
subjects, such as the Last Supper, models could have been found 
among the catacomb murals, but others, such as the story of 
Joshua, may have come from illustrated manuscripts, to which, 
since they were portable, art historians have assigned an impor¬ 
tant role as models.

ILLUSTRATED BOOKS Because Christianity, like Judaism, 
was based on the Word of God as revealed in the Bible, early 
Christians sponsored duplication of sacred texts on a large scale. 
What did the earliest Bible illustrations look like? Since books are 
frail things, we have only indirect evidence of their history in the 
ancient world. This begins in Egypt with scrolls made from the 
papyrus plant, which is like paper but more brittle (see page 77; 
fig. 3.41). Papyrus scrolls were produced throughout antiquity. 
Not until the second century bce, in late Hellenistic times, did 
better materials become available. These were parchment 
(bleached animal hide) and vellum (a type of parchment noted for 
its fineness), both of which last far longer than papyrus. They 
were strong enough to be creased without breaking and thus 
made possible the kind of bound book we know today, techni¬ 
cally called a codex, which appeared sometime in the late first 
century ce. 

Between the second and the fourth centuries ce, the vellum 
codex gradually replaced the papyrus roll. This change had an 
important effect on book illustration. Scroll illustrations seem to 
have been mostly line drawings, since layers of pigment would 
soon have cracked and come off during rolling and unrolling. 
Although parchment and vellum were less fragile than papyrus, 


they too were fragile mediums. Nevertheless, the codex permitted 
the use of rich colors, including gold. Hence it could make book 
illustration—or, as we usually say, manuscript illumination—the 
small-scale counterpart of murals, mosaics, and panel pictures. 
Some questions are still unanswered. When, where, and how 
quickly did book illumination develop? Were most of the subjects 
biblical, mythological, or historical? How much of a carryover 
was there from scroll to codex? 

One of the earliest surviving books that illustrate the Bible is 
an early fifth-century fragment, the so-called Quedlinburg Itala 
(fig. 8.18). The fragment is from an illustrated Book of Kings (one 
of the 39 books of the Hebrew Bible) that has been calculated to 
have originally contained some 60 illustrations, each image proba¬ 
bly comprising multiple scenes. On the folio (manuscript leaf) 
reproduced here, four scenes depict Saul s meeting with Samuel 
after the defeat of Amalekites (I Samuel 15:13-33); each scene is 
framed so as to accentuate the overall unity of the composition. 
The misty landscape, architectural elements, and sky-blue and pink 
background recall the antique Roman tradition of atmospheric 
illusionism of the sort we met in Roman painting (see fig. 7.55). 

Visible under the flaking paint in this badly damaged fragment 
are written instructions to the artist, part of which read, “You 
make the prophet speaking facing King Saul sacrificing.” 
Apparently the artist was left free to interpret pictorially these 
written instructions, suggesting the lack of an illustrated model. 

Particularly intriguing is the fact that the artist of the 
Quedlinburg fragment worked together in a Roman scriptorium

(a workshop for copying and illustrating manuscripts) with an 
artist who illustrated the first-century bce Roman pagan poet 
Vergil’s Aeneid and Georgies in the so-called Vatican Vergil , named 
after the collection in which it is housed today (fig. 8.19). We 
might well ask if this is evidence of non-Christian artists working 
for Christian patrons and to what extent pagan motifs might have 
been carried over to Christian subjects. 

Like the Quedlinburg It ala , the Vatican Vergil reflects the 
Roman tradition of illusionism and is closely linked in style to the 
mosaics of the contemporaneous Santa Maria Maggiore. The 
picture, separated from the rest of the page by a heavy frame, is 
like a window, and in the landscape—similar to that in the 
Quedlinburg Itala in being set off by the pink and blue sky—we 
find the remains of deep space, perspective, and the play of light 
and shade. The illustration is balanced by beautifully executed 
letters, which hover over the page like a curtain. 

Perhaps it is not accidental that the illusionism in both the 
Quedlinburg Itala and the Vatican Vergil reminds us so much of 
the art of Rome during its glory days, nor that so many architec¬ 
tural features of the contemporaneous Santa Maria Maggiore are 
so classicizing. All of these works were produced in Rome just 
when that city was under direct threat; the emphasis on Romes 
historic splendor might well have proven comforting during dif¬ 
ficult times. However, the political reality was far removed from 
the lofty ambitions of artists and patrons. Rome was sacked by 
the Visigoths in 410 and, as noted, the capital of the Western 
Empire was moved farther north, settling first in Milan, then 
finally in Ravenna. 


SCULPTURE As we have seen, the increase in standing of 
Christianity had a profound effect on artistic production, moving 
Christian art from a modest and private sphere to a public and 
official arena. As Early Christian architecture and its decoration 
began to demonstrate increasing monumentality as a result of its 
dependence on Roman imperial traditions, so too Early Christian 
sculpture became more impressive. This is apparent in a fine Early 
Christian stone coffin, the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (fig. 8.20). 

The richly carved sarcophagus was made for a prefect of Rome 
who died in 359 at age 42 and who, an inscription tells us, had 
been “newly baptized.” The front, divided by columns into ten 
compartments, contains scenes from the Hebrew Bible and the 
Christian one, also called the New Testament. In the upper regis¬ 
ter we see (from left to right) the Sacrifice of Isaac, St. Peter Taken 
Prisoner, Christ Enthroned Between Sts. Peter and Paul, and Jesus 
before Pontius Pilate (this last scene composed of two compart¬ 
ments). In the lower register are the Suffering of Job, the 
Temptation of Adam and Eve, Jesus’ Entry into Jerusalem, Daniel 
in the Lions’ Den, and St. Paul Led to His Martyrdom. 

Clearly the status of Christianity has changed when a major 
state official proclaims, both in inscription and through represen¬ 
tation, his belief in Christianity. The depictions of Peter and Paul, 
the veritable official saints of the city of Rome—each is commem¬ 
orated by a major basilica in the city—can be related to Junius 
Bassus’ role as a high-ranking government official. Authoritative 
as well is Christ’s place in the central scenes of each register. In the 
top register, Christ is enthroned with his feet treading on a per¬ 
sonification of Coelus, the Roman pagan god of the heavens, as he 


CHAPTER 8 EARLY JEWISH, EARLY CHRISTIAN, AND BYZANTINE ART 253 























dispenses the law to his disciples. Thus, Christ appropriates one 
of the emperor’s formal privileges, as lawgiver, a role that Junius 
Bassus as prefect would have exercised on the emperor’s behalf. 
Below this compartment, Christ enters Jerusalem in triumph. As 
compared to the earliest Christian representations, such as the 
Santa Maria Antiqua sarcophagus, Christ is now depicted directly, 
not through allusion alone, and his imperial nature is thereby 
accentuated. Daniel in the Lions’ Den, the Sacrifice of Isaac, and 
Adam and Eve are subjects that appeared in earlier representa¬ 
tions in catacombs. Daniel’s salvation is a type for Christ, as well 
as for all Christians who hope for divine salvation; Abraham’s 
willingness to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac parallels Gods sacri¬ 
fice on the Cross of his son, Jesus Christ; the fact that God spares 
Isaac speaks of salvation by Divine Grace; Adam and Eve refer to 
the Original Sin that led to Christs sacrificial death and his 
resurrection. Thus, old methods of explication are combined with 
new manifestations of Christianity’s important role in society, 
particularly by stressing Christ’s imperial nature. 

The style of the sarcophagus also relies on imperial conven¬ 
tion. This is most evident in the elements of classicism that are 
expressed, such as the placement within deep, space-filled niches 
of figures that recall the dignity of Greek and Roman sculpture. 
Other classicizing features include the way that the figures seem 
capable of distributing weight, the draperies that reveal the bod¬ 
ies beneath them, and the narrative clarity. However, beneath this 
veneer of classicism we recognize doll-like bodies with large 
heads and a passive air in scenes that would otherwise seem to call 
for dramatic action. It is as if the events and figures are no longer 
intended to tell their own story but to call to mind a larger sym¬ 
bolic meaning that unites them. 

The reliance on classicizing forms on the Sarcophagus of Junius 
Bassus reminds us that Early Christian art appears throughout the 
Mediterranean basin in what we think of as the classical world. 
During the first five centuries after Jesus’ death, the art of the 
entire area was more or less unified in content and style. 
Increasing political and religious divisions in the region, however, 
began to affect artistic production so that it is appropriate to rec¬ 
ognize the appearance, or, perhaps better stated, the growth of 
another branch of Christian art that we label Byzantine. 

BYZANTINE ART 


well as the political capital of the Empire. Justinian himself was a 
man of strongly Latin orientation, and he almost succeeded in 
reuniting Constantine’s domain. The monuments he sponsored 
have a grandeur that justifies the claim that his era was a Golden 
Age, as some have labeled it. 

The political and religious differences between East and West 
became an artistic division as well. In Western Europe, Celtic and 
Germanic peoples inherited the civilization of Late Antiquity, of 
which Early Christian art had been a part, but they then trans¬ 
formed it radically. The East, in contrast, experienced no such break. 
Late Antiquity lived on in the Byzantine Empire, although Greek 
and other eastern Mediterranean elements came increasingly to the 
fore at the expense of the Roman heritage. Even so, a sense of trad¬ 
ition played a central role in the development of Byzantine art. 

ARCHITECTURE AND ITS DECORATION Ironically, the 
greatest number of Early Byzantine monuments survives today not 
in Constantinople, where much has been destroyed, but on Italian 
soil, in Ravenna. That town, as we have seen, had become the cap¬ 
ital of the West Roman emperors at the beginning of the fifth cen¬ 
tury. At the end of the century it was taken by Theodoric, king of 
the Ostrogoths, whose tastes were patterned after those of Con¬ 
stantinople, where he had lived for an extended period. The Ostro- 
gothic rule of Ravenna ended in 540, when the Byzantine general 
Belisarius conquered the city for Justinian. Ravenna then became 
an exarchate, or provincial capital, the main stronghold of Byzan¬ 
tine rule in Italy. Thus, Ravenna serves as a kind of microcosm of 
the transformation and divisions of the later Roman Empire. 



Early Byzantine Art 

There is no clear-cut geographical or chronological line between 
Early Christian and Byzantine art. West Roman and East 
Roman—or, as some scholars prefer to call them, Western and 
Eastern Christian—traits are difficult to separate before the sixth 
century. Until that time, both geographical areas contributed to 
the development of Early Christian art. As the Western Empire 
declined, however, cultural leadership tended to shift to the 
Eastern Empire. This process was completed during the reign of 
Justinian, who ruled the Eastern Empire from 527 to 565. Under 
the patronage of Justinian, Constantinople became the artistic as

8.23 Exterior of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy 


The most important building of the Early Byzantine period, 
begun in 526 under Ostrogothic rule, was the church of San 
Vitale. Built chiefly during the 540s and completed in 547, it 
represents a Byzantine building of a type derived mainly from 
Constantinople. The octagonal plan with a circular core ringed by 
an ambulatory (figs. 8.21, 8.22 and 8.23) is a descendant of the 
mausoleum of Santa Costanza in Rome (see fig. 8.10), but other 
aspects of the building show the influence of the Eastern Empire, 
where domed churches of various kinds had been built during the 
previous century. Compared to Santa Costanza, San Vitale is both 
larger in scale and significantly richer in spatial effect (fig. 8.24). 
In particular, below the clerestory, the nave wall turns into a series 
of semicircular niches that penetrate the ambulatory and link that 
surrounding aisle to the nave in a new and intricate way. The 
movement around the center space is thus enlivened so that the 
decorated surfaces seem to pulsate. The aisle itself has a second 
story, the galleries, which may have been reserved for women. 
This reflects a practice in a number of Eastern religions, including 
some forms of Judaism, where it is current even today. Large win¬ 
dows on every level are made possible by a new economy in the 
construction of the vaulting—hollow clay tubes allowing for a 
lighter structure—and the interior is flooded with light. 

The plan of San Vitale shows only remnants of the longi¬ 
tudinal axis of the Early Christian basilica: toward the east, a 



8.24 Interior (view toward the apse) of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy 


CHAPTER 8 EARLY JEWISH, EARLY CHRISTIAN, AND BYZANTINE ART 255 

















cross-vaulted compartment for the altar, backed by an apse; and 
on the other side, a narthex. How did it happen that the East 
favored a type of church building (as distinct from mausoleums) 
so different from the basilica and—from the Western point of 
view—so ill-adapted to Christian ritual? After all, had not the 
design of the basilica been backed by the authority of Constantine 
himself? Scholars have suggested a number of reasons, practical, 
religious, and political, including the particular needs of the 


Eastern liturgy that would have been practiced in Ravenna. All of 
them may be relevant. In any event, from the time of Justinian, 
domed, central-plan churches dominated the world of Orthodox 
Christianity as thoroughly as the basilican plan dominated the 
architecture of the medieval West. 

At San Vitale the odd, nonsymmetrical placement of the 
narthex, which has never been fully explained, might be a key to 
helping us understand how the building functioned. Some have

suggested that the narthex is turned to be parallel to an atrium, the 
axis of which was determined by site limitations. Others see it as 
a conscious design feature that accentuates the transition between 
the exterior and interior of the church. Whatever the reason, in 
order to enter the building, visitors were forced to change axis, 
shifting to the right or left in order to align themselves with the 
main apse. The alteration of the journey into the building is unset¬ 
tling, almost disorienting, an effect heightened by passing from 
the lighted area of the narthex to the shaded ambulatory, and then 
into the high and luminous domed center space. The passage from 
physical to spiritual realms so essential to worship is manifest as a 
separation between the external world and the internal space of 
the building. 

The complexity of the architecture of the interior is matched 
by its lavish decoration. San Vitale s link with the Byzantine court 
can be seen in two prominent mosaics flanking the altar (figs. 8.25 
and 8.26). They depict Justinian and his empress, Theodora, 
accompanied by officials, the local clergy, and ladies-in-waiting,

about to enter the church, as if it were a palace chapel. In these 
large panels, the design of which most likely came from an impe¬ 
rial workshop, we find an ideal of beauty that is very different 
from the squat, large-headed figures we met in the art of the 
fourth and fifth centuries. These figures are tall and slim, with tiny 
feet and small almond-shaped faces dominated by huge eyes. 
They seem capable only of making ceremonial gestures and dis¬ 
playing magnificent costumes. There is no hint of movement or 
change. The dimensions of time and earthly space, suggested by a 
green ground, give way to an eternal present in the form of a 
golden otherworldly setting. Hence, the solemn, frontal images 
seem to belong as much to a celestial court as to a secular one. The 
quality of soaring slenderness that endows the figures with an air 
of mute exaltation is shared by the mysterious interior space of 
San Vitale, which these figures inhabit. 

The union of political and spiritual authority expressed in 
these mosaics reflects the “divine kingship” of the Byzantine 
emperor and honors the royal couple as donors of the church. It 
is as though the mosaic figures are in fact participating in the 
liturgy, even though the empress and emperor are actually thou¬ 
sands of miles away. The embroidery on the hem of Theodora’s 
mantle shows the three Magi carrying their gifts to Mary and the 
newborn King, and like them the imperial couple bring offerings. 
Justinian brings bread and Theodora a chalice, undoubtedly ref¬ 
erences to the Eucharist and Jesus 5 sacrifice of his own flesh and 
blood to redeem humanity. The emperor is flanked by 12 com¬ 
panions, the imperial equivalent of the 12 apostles. Moreover, 
Justinian is portrayed in a manner that recalls Constantine, that 
first Christian emperor: The shield with Christs monogram 
equates Justinian’s conquest of Ravenna with the divinely inspired 
Constantinian triumph at the Milvian Bridge that ultimately led 
to the founding of Constantinople, the court to which Justinian 
was heir. 

Among the surviving monuments of Justinian’s reign in 
Constantinople, the most important by far is Hagia Sophia 
(Church of Holy Wisdom) (figs. 8.27 and 8.28). The first church 
on that site was commissioned by Constantine but was destroyed

in 532 during rioting that almost deposed Justinian, who immedi¬ 
ately rebuilt the church, a sign of the continuity of his imperial 
authority Completed in only five years, Hagia Sophia achieved 
such fame that the names of the architects, too, were remembered: 
Anthemius of Tralles, an expert in geometry and the theory of 
statics and kinetics; and Isidorus of Miletus, who taught physics 
and wrote on vaulting techniques. The dome collapsed in the 
earthquake of 558, and a new, taller one was built from a design 
by Isidorus’ nephew. After the Turkish conquest in 1453, the 
church became a mosque. The Turks added four minarets and 
extra buttresses to the exterior at that time (see fig. 8.28), as well 
as large medallions with Islamic invocations on the interior (fig. 

8.29) . In the twentieth century, after the building was turned into 
a museum, some of the mosaic decoration that had been largely 
hidden under whitewash was uncovered. 

Hagia Sophia has the longitudinal axis of an Early Christian 
basilica, but the central feature of the nave is a vast, squarish space 
crowned by a huge dome (see fig. 8.27). At either end are half¬ 
domes, so that the nave takes the form of a great ellipse. Attached 
to the half-domes are semicircular apses with open arcades (a 
series of arches) similar to those in San Vitale. One might say, 
then, that the dome of Hagia Sophia has been placed over a cen¬ 
tral space and, at the same time, inserted between the two halves 
of a divided central-plan church. The dome rests on four arches 
that carry its weight to the piers, large, upright architectural sup¬ 
ports, at the corners of the square. Thus, the brilliant gold-mosaic 
walls below these arches, pierced with windows, have no weight¬ 
bearing function at all and act as mere curtains. The transition 
from the square formed by the arches to the circular rim of the 
dome is achieved by spherical triangles called pendentives (fig. 

8.30) . Hence, we speak of the entire unit as a dome on penden¬ 
tives. This device, along with a new technique for building domes 
using thin bricks embedded in mortar, permits the construction of 
taller, lighter, and more economical domes than the older method 
of placing the dome on a round or polygonal base as, for example, 
in the Pantheon in Rome (see fig. 7.24). 



Where or when the dome on pendentives was invented we do 
not know. Hagia Sophia is the earliest example we have of its use 
on a monumental scale, and it had a lasting impact. It became a 
basic feature of Byzantine architecture and, later, of Western 
architecture as well. Given the audacity of Hagia Sophia s design, 
it is not surprising that its architects were not described as 
builders, but rather as theoretical scientists, renowned for their 
knowledge of mathematics and physics. Its massive exterior, 
firmly planted upon the earth like a great mound, rises by stages 
to a height of 184 feet—41 feet taller than the Pantheon—and 
therefore its dome, though its diameter is somewhat smaller (112 
feet), stands out far more boldly in its urban setting. 

Once we are inside Hagia Sophia (see fig. 8.29), all sense of 
weight disappears. Nothing remains but a space that inflates, like 
so many sails, the apses, the pendentives, and the dome itself. The 
first dome, the one that fell in 558, was less steep than the present 
one, and one imagines that the sense of swelling form and heaving 
surface would originally have been even more intense than it is 
today. Here, the architectural aesthetic we saw taking shape in 
Early Christian architecture has achieved a new, magnificent 
dimension. Even more than before, light plays a key role. The 
dome seems to float—“like the radiant heavens,” according to a 
contemporary description—because it rests upon a closely spaced 
row of windows; light, both real and reflected, virtually separates 
the dome from the arches on which it rests. So many openings 
pierce the nave walls that the effect is akin to the transparency of 
lace curtains. The golden glitter of the mosaics must have com¬ 
pleted the “illusion of unreality.” Its purpose is clear. As 
Procopius, the court historian to Justinian, wrote: “Whenever one 
enters this church to pray, he understands at once that it is not by 
any human power or skill, but by the influence of God, that this 
work has been so finely turned. And so his mind is lifted up 
toward God and exalted, feeling that He cannot be far away, but 
must especially love to dwell in this place that He has chosen.” 
(See Primary Source , page 260.) We can sense the new aesthetic 
even in ornamental details such as moldings and capitals (fig. 

8.31). The scrolls, acanthus leaves, and similar decorations are 
motifs derived from classical architecture, but their effect here is 
radically different. The heavily patterned butterfly-marble facing 
of the piers denies their substantiality, and instead of actively 
cushioning the impact of heavy weight on the shaft of the column, 
the capital has become like an openwork basket of starched lace, 
the delicate surface pattern of which belies the strength and solid¬ 
ity of the stone. The contrast between the decoration of these 
structural members and their weight-bearing function accentuates 
the viewer s disorientation, an effect that would only have been 
increased if the interior of the building were viewed from aisle or 
gallery. In fact, it is from there that most congregants would have 
experienced the building during religious services, with no oppor¬ 
tunity to take in or understand the entire structure. 

The guiding principle of Graeco-Roman architecture had been 
to express a balance of opposing forces, rather like the balance 
within the contrapposto of a Classical statue. The result was a 
muscular display of active and passive members. In comparison, 


CHAPTER 8 EARLY JEWISH, EARLY CHRISTIAN, AND BYZANTINE ART 259 



OURCE 


Procopius of Caesarea 
(Sixth Century) 



From Buildings 

Procopius was a historian during the reign of Emperor Justinian. He 
wrote an entire hook (ca. 550 CE) about the fortifications, aqueducts, 
churches, and other public buildings constructed by Justinian through¬ 
out the Byzantine Empire. The hook begins with the greatest of these, 
Hagia Sophia (see figs. 8.27-8.31). 

T he emperor, disregarding all considerations of expense, raised 
craftsmen from the whole world. It was Anthemius of Tralles, 
the most learned man in the discipline called engineering, that minis¬ 
tered to the emperor s zeal by regulating the work of the builders and 
preparing in advance designs of what was going to be built. He had as 
partner another engineer called Isidore, a native of Miletus. 

So the church has been made a spectacle of great beauty, stupen¬ 
dous to those who see it and altogether incredible to those who hear 
of it. It subtly combines its mass with the harmony of its proportions, 
having neither any excess nor any deficiency, inasmuch as it is more 
pompous than ordinary [buildings] and considerably more decorous 


than those which are huge beyond measure; and it abounds exceed¬ 
ingly in gleaming sunlight. You might say that the [interior] space is 
not illuminated by the sun from the outside, but that the radiance is 
generated within, so great an abundance of light bathes this shrine all 

round_Above the arches the construction rises in a circle. Rising 

above this circle is an enormous spherical dome which makes the 
building exceptionally beautiful. It seems not to be founded on solid 
masonry, but to be suspended from heaven by that golden chain and 
so covers the space. All of these elements, marvelously fitted together 
in mid-air, suspended from one another and reposing only on the 
parts adjacent to them, produce a unified and most remarkable har¬ 
mony in the work, and yet do not allow the spectators to rest their 
gaze upon any one of them for a length of time, but each detail read¬ 
ily draws and attracts the eye to itself. Thus the vision constantly 
shifts round, and the beholders are quite unable to select any partic¬ 
ular element which they might admire more than all the others. No 
matter how much they concentrate their attention on this side and 
that, and examine everything with contracted eyebrows, they are 
unable to understand the craftsmanship and always depart from there 
amazed by the perplexing spectacle.

the material structure of Byzantine architecture, and to some 
extent of Early Christian architecture as well, is subservient to 
the creation of immaterial space. Walls and vaults seem like 
weightless shells, their actual thickness and solidity hidden rather 
than emphasized. And the glitter of the mosaics must have com¬ 
pleted the illusion of unreality, fitting the spirit of these interiors 
to perfection. 

SCULPTURE Beyond architectural decorations and some sar¬ 
cophagi, Early Byzantine sculpture consists mainly of reliefs in 
ivory and silver, which survive in considerable numbers. Vestiges 
of classicism are apparent in the beautifully carved ivory diptych 
of Justinian as Conqueror , which celebrates the emperor s victo¬ 
ries in Italy, North Africa, and Asia (fig. 8.32). The subject restates 
in Christian terms the allegorical scene on the breastplate of the 
Augustus of Primaporta (see fig. 7.29). The figure of Victory 
appears twice: above the emperor, to his right, and as a statuette 
held by the Roman officer at the left, who was no doubt mirrored 
in the missing panel at the right. Scythians, Indians, even lions and 
elephants, representing the lands conquered by Justinian, offer 
gifts and pay homage, while a figure personifying the Earth sup¬ 
ports Justinians foot to signify the emperor s dominion over the 
entire world. His role as triumphant general and ruler of the 
Empire is blessed from Heaven (note the sun, moon, and star) by 
Christ, whose image is in a medallion carried by two heraldically 
arranged angels. The large head and bulging features of Justinian 
brim with the same energy as his charging steed. He is a far cry 
from the calm philosopher portrayed on the Equestrian Statue of 
Marcus Aurelius (see fig. 7.33) from which the image is derived.

An ivory relief showing the archangel Michael (fig. 8.33), also 
from the time of Justinian, looks back to earlier classical ivories. 
It may have been paired with a missing panel showing Justinian, 
who, it has been suggested, commissioned it. The inscription 
above has the prayer “Receive these gifts, and having learned the 
cause...,” which would probably have continued on the missing 
leaf with a plea to forgive the owners sins, apparently a reference 
to the emperor s humility. In any event, this ivory must have been 
done around 520-30 by an imperial workshop in Constantinople. 

The majestic archangel is a descendant of the winged Victories 
of Graeco-Roman art, down to the rich drapery revealing lithe 
limbs (see fig. 5.47), and recalls the Victories on the plaque of 
Justinian as Conqueror {set fig. 8.32). Here, classicism has become 
an eloquent vehicle for Christian content. The power the angel 
heralds is not of this world, nor does he inhabit an earthly space. 
The niche he occupies has lost all three-dimensional reality. The 
angel s relationship to its architectural setting is purely symbolic 
and ornamental, so that, given the position of the feet on the steps, 
he seems to hover rather than stand. From the ankles down he 
seems to be situated between the columns, while his arms and 
wings are in front of them. It is this disembodied quality, con¬ 
veyed through harmonious forms, that makes the archangel 
Michael s presence so compelling. The paradox of a believable

figure represented naturalistically but existing within an ambigu¬ 
ous, indeed impossible, setting connects this work with other 
products of Justinian’s court, such as those buildings where solid 
structures serve to create ephemeral spaces. 

ILLUSTRATED BOOKS Illustrated books of the Early 
Byzantine period also contain echoes of Graeco-Roman style 
adapted to religious narrative. The most important example, the 
Vienna Genesis (fig. 8.34), containing a Greek text of the first 
book of the Bible, has a richness similar to the mosaics we have 
seen. White highlights and fluttering drapery that clings to the 
bodies animate the scene. The book was written in silver (now 
tarnished black) and decorated with brilliantly colored miniatures 


on dyed-purple vellum, that color being reserved for the imperial 
court. Although some scholars have suggested that an imperial 
scriptorium in Constantinople produced the manuscript, recent 
research points to Syria as the more likely source because there 
are parallels to manuscripts produced there, as well as some 
Syrian mosaics. 

Our page shows a number of scenes from the story of Jacob. 
In the center foreground, Jacob wrestles with the angel and then 
receives his blessing. Hence, the picture does not show just a 
single event but a whole sequence. The scenes take place along a 
U-shaped path, so that progression in space becomes progression 
in time. This method, known as continuous narration, goes back 
as far as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Its appearance in

miniatures such as this may reflect earlier illustrations made in 
scroll rather than book form, although this hypothesis has been 
contested. The picture certainly looks like a frieze turned back 
upon itself. For manuscript illustration, continuous narrative 
makes the most economical use of space. The painter can pack a 
maximum number of scenes into a small area, and the picture can 
be read like lines of text as a running account, rather than as a 
window that requires a frame. 

ICONS The religious icon (from the Greek word eikon , meaning 
“image”) provided another focus for representation at the time of 
Justinian. Icons generally took Christ, the Enthroned Madonna, 
or saints as their principal subjects, and were objects of personal 
as well as public veneration. From the beginning they were con¬ 
sidered portraits, for such pictures had developed in Early 
Christian times out of Graeco-Roman portrait panels. The issue 
that they might be considered idols led to arguments about their 
appropriateness and their power. (See Primary Source , page 266.) 
These discussions related to the contemporaneous debates on the 
dual nature of Christ as God and man, at once both spiritual and 
physical—debates that Byzantine emperors had no qualms about 
joining. One of the chief arguments in favor of image production 
was the claim that Christ had appeared with the Virgin to St. Luke 
and permitted him to paint their portrait together, and that other 
portraits of Christ or of the Virgin had miraculously appeared on 
earth by divine command. These “true” sacred images were con¬ 
sidered to have been the sources for the later ones made by human 
artists, permitting a chain of copies and copies of copies, which 
has often made it difficult for art historians to date them. 

Icons functioned as living images to instruct and inspire the 
worshiper. (See www.myartslab.com. ) Because the actual figure— 
be it Christ, Mary, a saint, or an angel—was thought to reside in 
the image, icons were believed to be able to intercede on behalf of 
the faithful. They were reputed to have miraculous healing prop¬ 
erties, and some were carried into battle or placed over city gates, 
effectively offering totemic protection to their communities. 
Describing an icon of the archangel Michael, the sixth-century 
poet Agathias writes: “The wax remarkably has represented the 
invisible....The viewer can directly venerate the archangel [and] 
trembles as if in his actual presence. The eyes encourage deep 
thoughts; through art and its colors the innermost prayer of the 
viewer is passed to the image. ” 

Little is known about the origins of icons, since most early 
examples were intentionally destroyed by those who believed 
they led to idolatry; hence icons are scarce. The irony of this is 
particularly poignant, since early icons were painted in encaustic, 
the medium in which pigment is suspended in hot wax, chosen for 
its durability. 

Many of the surviving early examples come from the 
Monastery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai in Egypt. Monasteries, 
such as that at Mount Sinai, were heirs to a tradition that had 
developed in Egypt in the second and third centuries, whereby 
people withdrew from society and its material temptations to 
devote themselves to prayer and contemplation. Although many 


of these early ascetics lived alone as hermits, increasingly they 
gathered together to live in monasteries, communities governed 
by a series of regulations, called the Rule. (See www.myartslab.com. ) 
The Rule that was followed determined the type, or Order, of the 
monastic community. By the fifth century, monasticism had 
spread north into Italy, across the Continent, and throughout 
western Britain and Ireland. 

The isolated desert location of Sinai and its remove from 
the material world aided the survival of numerous objects there. 
An icon of Christ (fig. 8.35), generally dated to sometime in the 
sixth century but with later repainting, is magnificent for its 
freshness of color and vibrancy of brushstroke. Its link with

Graeco-Roman portraiture is clear not only from the use of 
encaustic but also from the gradations of light and shade in 
Christ s face and on his neck, reminiscent of the treatment of the 
woman in our Roman Fayum portrait, also in encaustic (see fig. 
7.47). The combination of a frontal, unflinching gaze, establishing 
a direct bond with the viewer, with the lively and lifelike model¬ 
ing of the face suggests the kind of dichotomy between spiritual 
and physical that we have seen in so much Early Byzantine art. 
That dichotomy is accentuated here by the enormous gold halo 


hovering over an architectural background. It is as if the walls 
retreat into the background in response to the halo and in order 
to allow space for Christ. 

The Virgin and Child Enthroned Between Saints and Angels 
icon (fig. 8.36), also from the Monastery of St. Catherine at 
Mount Sinai, is striking for the variety of styles used to represent 
the different figure types. The Virgin and Christ are large, their 
modeled faces help convey with some delicacy their solidity, 
while the two warrior saints, probably Theodore on the left and 


264 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 




George (or Demetrios) on the right, recall the stiff figures that 
accompany Justinian in San Vitale (see fig. 8.25). Typically for 
early icons, however, their heads are too large for their doll-like 
bodies. Behind are two almost ethereal angels looking skyward; 
both resemble Roman representations. It is typical of the conser¬ 
vative icon tradition that an artist would remain faithful to his 
varied sources in order to preserve the likenesses of the holy fig¬ 
ures; yet it is also possible that different styles in the same work 
are considered appropriate for the differing religious roles the 
portrayed personages play. For example, the Virgin s pose signals 
that for the Byzantines the Madonna was the regal mother, the 
Theotokos , while the stiff formality of the soldier saints is appro¬ 
priate to represent stalwart defenders of the faith. 


The Iconoclastic Controversy 

After the time of Justinian, the development of Byzantine art— 
not only painting but sculpture and architecture as well—was dis¬ 
rupted by the so-called Iconoclastic Controversy. The conflict, 
which began with an edict promulgated by the Byzantine 
emperor Leo III in 726 prohibiting religious images, raged for 
more than 100 years between two hostile groups. The image 
destroyers, Iconoclasts, led by the emperor and supported mainly 
in the eastern provinces, insisted on a literal interpretation of the 
biblical ban against graven images because their use led to idola¬ 
try. They wanted to restrict religious art to abstract symbols and 
plant or animal forms. Their opponents, the Iconophiles, were led 
by the monks and were particularly centered in the western 
provinces, where the imperial edict remained ineffective for the 
most part. The strongest argument in favor of icons was Neo- 
Platonic: Because Christ and his image are inseparable, the honor 
given to the image is transferred to him. (See Primary Source , 
page 266.) 

The roots of the argument go very deep. Theologically, they 
involved the basic issue of the relationship of the human and the 
divine in the person of Christ. Moreover, some people resented 
that, for many, icons had come to replace the Eucharist as the 
focus of lay devotion. Socially and politically, the conflict was a 
power struggle between Church and State, which in theory were 
united in the figure of the emperor. The conflict came during a 
low point in Byzantine power, when the Empire had been greatly 
reduced in size by the rise of Islam. Iconoclasm, it was argued, 
was justified by Leo’s victories over the Arabs, who were them¬ 
selves, ironically, iconoclasts. The controversy caused an irrepara¬ 
ble break between Catholicism and the Orthodox faith, although 
the two churches remained officially united until 1054, when the 
pope excommunicated the Eastern patriarch for heresy. 

If the edict barring images had been enforced throughout the 
Empire, it might well have dealt Byzantine religious art a fatal 
blow. It did succeed in greatly reducing the production of sacred 
images, but it failed to wipe it out entirely, so there was a fairly 
rapid recovery after the victory of the Iconophiles in 843. The 
Khludov Psalter (fig. 8.37) was produced soon after that date, 
perhaps in Constantinople and for use in Hagia Sophia. A psalter 


contains the Book of Psalms from the Hebrew Bible. The Psalms, 
traditionally believed to have been written by King David, are 
sacred songs or hymns. The illustration in figure 8.37 accompa¬ 
nies Psalm 69, a plea by the psalmist for salvation from his tor¬ 
mentors. The illustrations not only make the case for why images 
should be permitted, they also liken the Iconoclasts, identified by 
inscription, with the crucifiers of Jesus, whose vinegar-soaked 
sponge is equated with the implements used to whitewash icons. 


Middle Byzantine Art 

While we know little for certain about how the Byzantine artistic 
tradition managed to survive from the early eighth to the mid¬ 
ninth century, Iconoclasm seems to have brought about a renewed 
interest in secular art, which was not affected by the ban. This 
may help to explain the astonishing appearance of antique motifs 
in the art of the Middle Byzantine period, sometimes referred to 
as the Second Golden Age. Hence, there was a fairly rapid recov¬ 
ery after the victory of the Iconophiles. A revival of Byzantine

OURCE 


St. Theodore the Studite 


( 759-826 ce) 



From Second and Third Refutations of the 
Iconoclasts 

Theodore of the Stoudios monastery in Constantinople was a principal 
defender of icons against the Iconoclasts. St. Theodore rejuted their 
charges of idolatry by examining how an image is and is not identical to 
its prototype (the person portrayed). Some of his arguments refect the 
Neo-Platonic theory expounded by Plotinus that the sense-world is 
related to the divine by emanation. 

E very image has a relation to its archetype; the natural image has a 
natural relation, while the artificial image has an artificial rela¬ 
tion. The natural image is identical both in essence and in likeness 
with that of which it bears the imprint: thus Christ is identical with 
His Father in respect to divinity, but identical with His mother in 
respect to humanity The artificial image is the same as its archetype 
in likeness, but different in essence, like Christ and His icon. 


Therefore there is an artificial image of Christ, to whom the image has 
its relation. 

If every body is inseparably followed by its own shadow, and no 
one in his right mind could say that a body is shadowless, but rather 
we can see in the body the shadow which follows, and in the shadow 
the body which precedes: thus no one could say that Christ is image¬ 
less, if indeed He has a body with its characteristic form, but rather 
we can see in Christ His image existing by implication and in the 
image Christ plainly visible as its prototype. 

By its potential existence even before its artistic production we can 
always see the image in Christ; just as, for example, we can see the 
shadow always potentially accompanying the body, even if it is not 
given form by the radiation of light. In this manner it is not un¬ 
reasonable to reckon Christ and His image among things which are 
simultaneous. 

If, therefore, Christ cannot exist unless His image exists in poten¬ 
tial, and if, before the image is produced artistically, it subsists always 
in the prototype: then the veneration of Christ is destroyed by any¬ 
one who does not admit that His image is also venerated in Him.

Press, 1 981) 


artistic traditions, as well as of classical learning and literature, 
followed the years of Iconoclasm and lasted from the late ninth 
to the eleventh century. This revival, spearheaded by Emperor 
Basil I the Macedonian, was underscored by the reopening of the 
university in Constantinople. 

ILLUSTRATED BOOKS An example of the antique revival is 
the Joshua Roll (fig. 8.38), illustrated in Constantinople in the 
middle of the tenth century. Some art historians have seen these 
illustrations of the Hebrew Bible hero Joshua s victories in the 


Holy Land as alluding to recent Byzantine military successes 
against the Muslims there. But there are problems correlating the 
historical events with the date of the manuscript based on stylis¬ 
tic criteria. It is possible that the manuscript projects aspirations 
more than it reflects accomplishments. That the manuscript takes 
the form of a scroll, an archaic type of manuscript that had been 
replaced by the codex a full eight centuries earlier (see page 252), 
is remarkable. Whether or not scholars who argue that the manu¬ 
script is an accurate copy of an earlier scroll are correct, the drawn

landscapes and against cityscapes give us some idea of what 
antique examples must have looked like. That such an obsolete, 
indeed impractical, vehicle as the scroll, whether an original or a 
copy, was chosen for such a lavish enterprise illustrates why 
scholars have referred to this period as a renaissance, or rebirth, 
crediting much of its vigor to Constantine VII, who ruled in the 
tenth century. Emperor in name only for most of his life, he 
devoted his energies instead to art and scholarship. 

David Composing the Psalms (fig. 8.39) is one of eight full- 
page scenes in the mid-tenth-century Paris Psalter. Illustrating 
David s life, these scenes introduce the Psalms, which, as stated 
above, David was thought to have composed. Not only do we 
find a landscape that recalls Roman murals (see fig. 7.55), but the 
figures, too, clearly derive from Roman models. David himself 


could well be mistaken for Orpheus charming the beasts with his 
music. His companions are even more surprising, since they are 
allegorical figures that have nothing to do with the Bible. The 
young woman next to David is the personification of Melody, the 
one coyly hiding behind a pillar is the mountain nymph Echo, 
and the male figure with a tree trunk personifies the mountains of 
Bethlehem. 

Once again style promotes meaning in the way consciously 
classical forms herald the revival of image making after the 
Iconoclastic Controversy. But despite the presence of revivalist 
aspects, the late date of the picture is evident from certain quali¬ 
ties of style, such as the crowded composition of space-consuming 
figures and the abstract zigzag pattern of the drapery covering 
Melody’s legs. In truth, one might well ask to what extent and

how, despite Iconoclasm, antique methods and forms survived— 
that is, how much of what we see is the result of continuities 
rather than revivals. 

SCULPTURE Monumental sculpture, as we saw earlier, largely 
disappeared from the fifth century on. In Byzantine art, large- 
scale statuary died out with the last imperial portraits, and stone 
carving was confined almost entirely to architectural ornament. 
But small-scale reliefs, especially in ivory and metal, continued to 
be produced in large numbers with a variety of content, style, and 
purpose. The Harbaville Triptych (fig. 8.40), named after a recent 
owner, is a portable shrine in ivory with two hinged wings of the 
kind a high official might carry for his private worship while trav¬ 
eling; despite its monumental presence, it is less than 10 inches 
high. This triptych, and others like it, serve as a vehicle for private 
devotion, establishing a parallel between the act of prayer on the 
part of viewers with the role of the saints who pray for them. In 
the upper half of the center panel we see Christ Enthroned. 
Flanking him are John the Baptist and the Virgin, who plead for 
divine mercy on behalf of humanity. This scene, the so-called 
deesis, was a theme of relatively recent Byzantine invention. 
Below are five apostles arranged in strictly frontal view. Only in 
the upper tier of each wing of the triptych is this formula relaxed. 
There, we find an echo of classical contrapposto in the poses of 
the military saints in the top registers of the lateral panels. It is 
possible that we are looking at a continuity of the approach we 
saw in the early Virgin and Child Enthroned between Saints and 
Angels icon from Mount Sinai (see fig. 8.36), whereby different 
figure types require different representational modes. Here, the 
active poses of the military saints contrast with the elegant 
restraint of the other holy figures, whereas in the Mount Sinai

icon the angels have the active poses and the military saints 
are static. 

Refinement and control also mark the attitude of the figures 
on the ivory of Christ Crowning Romanos and Eudokia (fig. 8.41), 
where the authority of the two haloed figures is confirmed by 
their divine election as emperor and empress. Once again there is 
some stylistic opposition, perhaps even tension: The body-reveal¬ 
ing drapery of Christ contrasts with the stiff, patterned garments 
of the imperial figures; the ample space that surrounds Christ 
contrasts with the ambiguous space between the flanking figures 
and the elevated podium on which Christ stands. Unequivocal, 
however, as with the Justinian as Conqueror ivory (see fig. 8.32), 
is the message of a relationship between a pious emperor and his 
god, beneficial to both parties. The imperial couple s elevated rela¬ 
tionship to Christ recalls that of John the Baptist and Mary on the 
Harbaville Triptych (see fig. 8.40).

ARCHITECTURE AND ITS DECORATION Byzantine archi¬ 
tecture never produced another structure to match the scale of 
Hagia Sophia. The churches built after the Iconoclastic 
Controversy were initially modest in scale and usually monastic, 
perhaps reflecting the fact that monks had been important in 
arguing against Iconoclasm; later monasteries erected in 
Constantinople under imperial patronage were much larger and 
served social purposes as schools and hospitals. Monasticism 
dominated the practice of Christianity, and in monastic churches 
liturgy, ritual, and symbolism were combined in a dynamic man¬ 
ner. The monastic Church of the Dormition at Daphni, near 
Athens in Greece, follows the usual Middle Byzantine plan of a 
Greek cross contained within a square, but with a narthex added 
on one side and an apse on the other (fig. 8.42). The central fea¬ 
ture is a dome on a cylinder, or drum. The drum raises the dome 
high above the rest of the building and demonstrates a preference 
for elongated proportions (fig. 8.43). The impact of this vertical¬ 
ly, however, strikes us fully only when we enter the church. The 
tall, narrow compartments produce both an unusually active 
space, with abrupt changes of light and shade, and a sense almost 
of compression. This feeling is dramatically relieved as we raise 
our glance toward the luminous pool of space beneath the dome, 
which draws us around and upward (fig. 8.44). The suspended 
dome of Hagia Sophia is clearly the conceptual precedent for 
this form. 

The mosaics inside the church at Daphni are some of the finest 
works of the Second Golden Age. They show a dignity and 
gravity that merges harmoniously with the spiritualized ideal of

8.45 The Crucifixion, Church of the Dormition, Daphni, Greece. 

Mosaic 

human beauty we encountered in the art of Justinian’s reign. For 
instance, the classical qualities of The Crucifixion mosaic (fig. 
8.45), on the east wall of the north transept arm of the church, are 
deeply felt, yet they are also completely Christian. There is no 
attempt to create a realistic spatial setting, but the composition 
has a balance and clarity that are truly monumental. The heroic 
nudity of Christ and the statuesque dignity of the two flanking 
figures make them seem extraordinarily organic and graceful 
compared to the stiff poses in the Justinian and Theodora mosaics 
at San Vitale (see figs. 8.25 and 8.26). 

This new interest in depicting the crucified Christ, that is, the 
Christ of the Passion, seems more emotional than physical. In the 
Daphni Crucifixion mosaic, Christ is flanked by the Virgin and 
St. John. The gestures and facial expressions of all three figures 
convey a restrained and noble suffering. We cannot say when and 
where this human interpretation of the Savior first appeared, but 
it seems to have developed in the wake of the Iconoclastic 
Controversy. There are, to be sure, a few earlier examples of it, 
but none of them appeals to the emotions of the viewer so 
powerfully as the Daphni Crucifixion. To have introduced this 
compassionate view of Christ into sacred depiction was perhaps 
the greatest achievement of Middle Byzantine art. Early Christian 


art lacked this quality entirely. It stressed the Saviors divine 
wisdom and power rather than his sacrificial death. Hence, Early 
Christian artists depicted the Crucifixion only rarely and without 
pathos, though with a similar simplicity. 

Alongside the new emphasis on the Christ of the Passion, the 
Second Golden Age gave importance to the image of Christ 
Pantocrator, an oversize, awesome (though heavily restored) 
mosaic image of which stares down from the center of the dome 
at Daphni against a gold background (see fig. 8.44). The 
Pantocrator is Christ as both Judge and Ruler of the Universe, the 
All-Holder who contains everything. The type descends from 
images of the bearded Zeus. The bearded face of Jesus first 
appears during the sixth century, and we have already seen an 
early example in the icon from Mount Sinai (see fig. 8.35). Once 
again, tradition and innovation mark Middle Byzantine 
achievements. 

These two mosaic images are part of a larger comprehensive 
program that served a special spiritual function. (See 
,) Otto Demus, writing in 1948, felicitously 
described Middle Byzantine churches such as the one at Daphni 
as a cosmos, the dome representing the heavens, while the vaults 
and the squinches, those devices, similar to pendentives, used to 
cut the corners of the square space below to make a transition to 
the cylinder above, signify the Holy Land (see figs. 8.43 and 8.44). 
The walls and supports below form the earthly world. Thus, there 
is a hierarchy of level, increasing verticality being equated with 
degrees of holiness, a sense of which is reinforced by the physical 
experience of the building s upward spiral pull. The beholder is on 
the lowest level; the saints are on the walls and supports (visible 
in fig. 8.43); events in the life of Jesus that took place in the Holy 
Land, including the Annunciation, Nativity, Baptism, and 
Transfiguration, are on the vaults and squinches (figs. 8.43 and 
8.44 show the Annunciation in the lower left squinch, while the 
other scenes move around in a counterclockwise direction); and 
the Pantocrator is in the dome above (see fig. 8.44). Taken 
together, these representations illustrate the Orthodox belief in 
the Incarnation as the redemption of Original Sin and the triumph 
over death. 

The movement around the building to witness the 
Christological cycle, which depicts the events of Christ s life, 
makes viewers, in effect, symbolic pilgrims to the Holy Land and 
is combined with a vertical momentum, a virtual personal journey 
Heavenward. The impression is quite different from the experi¬ 
ence of viewers in a Western basilica, even if both attempt to 
define a spiritual journey through architectural means and in aes¬ 
thetic terms. In both, passage through space is a means to a goal, 
but when Orthodox (Eastern) and Catholic (Western) churches 
are compared, the manner and direction of movement is very 
different indeed. The decoration at Daphni, magnificent as it is, 
survives only in fragmentary state. The Venetians desecrated the 
church in 1207 and in the 1890s earthquake damage was severe. 
As a result of these vicissitudes, the mosaics were heavily restored 
and the marble revetment that covered the walls is now missing, 
the exposed stone and brick giving the building a too-sturdy

aspect. Also missing, since Daphni lacks the monastic community 
that was responsible for its creation—today it is a museum—is the 
experiential quality of chanting clergy, burning incense, and glit¬ 
tering liturgical objects of precious metals. 

The largest and most lavishly decorated church of the period 
that still survives is St. Mark s in Venice (figs. 8.46 and 8.47), 
begun in 1063, only nine years after the official schism between 
the Western and Eastern churches. Venice was a province of 
Ravenna and for some time, thus, a Byzantine dependency. The 
Church of St. Mark s was both a palace chapel for the Venetian 
rulers and a cathedral (a bishop s church, so named because it 
houses the bishop s throne, or cathedra in Latin). The church was 
so extensive, employing five domes in place of Daphni s single 
dome, that the Classical system used at Daphni had to be 
expanded here. The present structure replaced two earlier 
churches of the same name on the site; it is modeled on the 
Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, which had been 
rebuilt by Justinian after the riot of 532 and was later destroyed. 
The Venetians had long been under Byzantine rule, and they 
remained artistically dependent on the East for many years after 
they had become politically and commercially powerful in their

own right. Their wish to emulate Byzantium, and Constantinople 
in particular, is evidence of the great sway that culture and city 
still held. 

At St. Mark s the Greek-cross plan is emphasized, since each 
arm of the cross has a dome of its own. These domes are not raised 
on drums. Instead, they are encased in bulbous wooden helmets 
covered by gilt copper sheeting and topped by ornate lanterns 
(small structures often used to admit light into the enclosed spaces 
below), so that the domes appear taller and more visible at a 
distance. (They make a splendid landmark for seafarers.) The 
spacious interior shows that St. Mark s was meant for the people 


of a large city rather than a small monastic community such as 
at Daphni. 

The Byzantine manner, transmitted to Italy, became known as 
the “Greek style.” Sometimes it was carried by models from 
Constantinople, but most often it was brought directly by visiting 
Byzantine artists. At St. Mark s, Byzantine artists and the locals 
trained by them executed the mosaics. The “Greek style” also 
appears in a number of magnificent churches and monasteries in 
Sicily, a former Byzantine holding that was taken from the 
Muslims by the Normans in 1091 and then united with southern 
Italy. The Norman kings considered themselves the equals of the 


272 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 





























Biblical and Celestial Beings 



Much of Western art refers to biblical persons and celestial beings. 
Their names appear in titles of paintings and sculpture and in discus¬ 
sions of subject matter. The following is a brief guide to some of the 
most commonly encountered persons and beings in Christian art. 

Patriarchs Literally, patriarchs are the male heads of families, or 
rulers of tribes. The Hebrew Bible patriarchs are Abraham, Isaac, 
Jacob, and Jacob’s 1 2 sons. The word patriarch may also refer to the 
bishops of the five chief bishoprics of Christendom: Alexandria, 
Antioch, Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Rome. 

Prophets In Christian art, the word prophets usually refers to the 
Hebrew Bible figures whose writings were seen to foretell the coming 
of Christ. The so-called major prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, and 
Ezekiel. The minor prophets are Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, 
Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. 
Trinity Central to Christian belief is the doctrine of the Trinity which 
states that One God exists in Three Persons: Father, Son (Jesus Christ), 
and Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is often represented as a dove. 

Holy Family The infant Jesus, his mother Mary (also called the Virgin 
or the Virgin Mary), and his foster father, Joseph, constitute the Holy 
Family. Sometimes Mary’s mother, St. Anne, appears with them. 

John the Baptist The precursor of Jesus Christ, John the Baptist is 
regarded by Christians as the last prophet before the coming of the 
Messiah in the person of Jesus. John baptized his followers in the 
name of the coming Messiah; he recognized Jesus as that Messiah 
when he saw the Holy Spirit descend on Jesus when he came to John 
to be baptized. John the Baptist is not the same person as John the 
Evangelist, one the the 1 2 apostles. 


Evangelists There are four: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—each an 
author of one of the Gospels. Matthew and John were among Jesus’ 
1 2 apostles. Mark and Luke wrote in the second half of the first 
century ce. 

Apostles/Disciples The apostles are the 1 2 disciples of Jesus 
Christ. He asked them to convert the “nations” to his faith. They are 
Peter (Simon Peter), Andrew, James the Greater, John, Philip, 
Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the Less, Jude (or Thaddaeus), 
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot. After Judas betrayed Jesus, 
his place was taken by Matthias. St. Paul (though not a disciple) is also 
considered an apostle. 

Angels and Archangels Beings of a spiritual nature, angels are spo¬ 
ken of in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles as having been created by 
God to be heavenly messengers between God and human beings, 
heaven, and earth. Mentioned first by the apostle Paul, archangels, 
unlike angels, have names: Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. In all, there 
are seven archangels in the Christian tradition. 

Saints Persons are declared saints only after death. The pope 
acknowledges sainthood by canonization, a process based on meeting 
rigid criteria of authentic miracles and beatitude, or blessed character. 
At the same time, the pope ordains a public cult of the new saint 
throughout the Catholic Church. A similar process is followed in the 
Orthodox Church. 

Martyrs Originally, the word martyr (from the Greek meaning “wit¬ 
ness”) referred to each of the apostles. Later, it signified those perse¬ 
cuted for their faith. Still later, the term was reserved for those who 
died in the name of Christ. 



Byzantine emperors and proved it by calling in teams of 
mosaicists from Constantinople to decorate their splendid 
religious buildings. The mosaics at the cathedral of Monreale (fig. 
8.48), are the last examples to be executed in Sicily in a thoroughly 
Byzantine style, although the selection and distribution of their 
subjects are largely Western. The wall surfaces these mosaics 
covered are vast; the largest to be decorated in this technique. The 
art historian John Lowden has claimed that 100 million individual 
tesserae would have been needed to create the more than l 1 /acres 
of mosaics at Monreale. The artists adapted their figure types and 
subjects to a Western building and Western subjects. Certainly 
masterful is the way the Pantocrator of a Byzantine domed 
church now controls the space of the apse and the way registers 
of figures lining the walls define, indeed clarify in a very un- 
Byzantine way, the basilica form. Even if the composition is 
unlike that of Byzantine churches of the period in Greece and 
Constantinople, it does parallel the arrangement of figures on 
some Middle Byzantine icons and ivories, such as the Harbaville 
Triptych (see fig. 8.40). Christ s open book contains the text “I am 
the light of the world...” in Greek on one page and in Latin on 
the other, the schism in language being united through art. 


Late Byzantine Art 

In 1204, Byzantium suffered an almost fatal defeat when the 
armies of the Fourth Crusade, instead of warring against the 
Turks, captured and sacked the city of Constantinople. For more 
than 50 years, the core of the Eastern Empire remained in Western 
hands. Byzantium, however, survived this catastrophe. In 1261, it 
regained its independence, which lasted until the Turkish con¬ 
quest in 1453. The fourteenth century saw a last flowering of 
Byzantine painting under a series of enlightened rulers. 

ICONS The Crusades decisively changed the course of Byzantine 
art through bringing it into contact with the West. The impact is 
apparent in the Madonna Enthroned (fig. 8.49), which unites 
elements of East and West, so that its authorship has been 
much debated. Because icons were objects of veneration, and 
because they embodied sacredness, they had to conform to strict 
rules, with fixed patterns repeated over and over again. As a 
result, most icons are noteworthy more for exacting craftsman¬ 
ship than artistic inventiveness. Although painted at the end of the 
thirteenth century, our example reflects a much earlier type

(see fig. 8.36). There are echoes of the Middle Byzantine style in 
the graceful pose, the play of drapery folds, and the tender melan¬ 
choly of the Virgins face. But these elements have become 
abstract, reflecting a new taste and style in Late Byzantine art. 
The highlights on the drapery that resemble sunbursts are not a 
new development, yet they seem more rigid and stylized than in 
Middle Byzantine examples. Faces are carefully modeled with 
gentle highlights and suave shading. The linear treatment of drap¬ 
ery in combination with the soft shading of hands and faces 
continues the long-established Byzantine pattern of having natu¬ 
ralistic and antinaturalistic aspects play off each other in the 
same work. 


The total effect is neither flat nor spatial, but transparent—so 
that the shapes look as if they are lit from behind. Indeed, the gold 
background and highlights are so brilliant that even the shadows 
never seem wholly opaque. This all-pervading radiance, we will 
recall, first appears in Early Christian mosaics (see fig. 8.17). 
Panels such as the Madonna Enthroned may therefore be viewed 
as the aesthetic equivalent of mosaics and not simply as the 
descendants of the panel-painting tradition. In fact, some of the 
most precious Byzantine icons are miniature mosaics attached to 
panels, and our artist may have been trained as a mosaicist rather 
than as a painter. 

Although many details relate this icon to Byzantine works, 
particularly from Constantinople, some scholars claim that it was 
produced by a Western artist in emulation of Byzantine painting. 
For example, the manner in which the Enthroned Virgin presents 
the Christ Child is Byzantine, while the blessing gesture of Christ 
is Western. The red background of the angels in medallions is 
another feature found in the West rather than in Byzantium. 
An origin in Cyprus, then ruled by the French, has been 
suggested, but where this work was painted remains an open 
question. The controversy is heightened by the fact that the icon 
was subjected to a very heavy restoration before it arrived at the 
National Gallery in Washington, D.C. Whatever its origin, 
the Madonna Enthroned points to a profound shift in the relation¬ 
ship between the two traditions: After 600 years of borrowing 
from Byzantium, Western art has begun to contribute something 
in return. 

An icon from Ohrid, in Macedonia, though probably made in 
Constantinople, illustrates a type distinct from those we have seen 
previously in that it relates a narrative event, the Annunciation to 
the Virgin of her imminent role as Mother of God (fig. 8.50). The 
increased interest in narrative subjects for icons might derive from 
the elaborate decorative programs in Middle Byzantine churches. 
This icon is bilateral (or two-sided). On the other side, the Virgin 
Mary, to whom the church at Ohrid was dedicated, is represented 
holding her son. Such icons were probably meant to be mounted 
on a pole, both for processions and for placement within churches, 
where worshipers would have been able to view both sides. 

The gold background heightens the tension of the spatial 
relationship established between the archangel Gabriel and the 
Virgin. The former both cuts through space and slides across it, 
while the latter seems boxed in by the canopy that frames and 
encloses her. In the sharpness of their folds, Gabriel s garments 
appear almost metallic. These contrast with the dark robes of the 
Virgin. One can imagine how moved a viewer might have been by 
personal contact with this imposing icon, which measures more 
than 3 feet high. 

MOSAICS AND MURAL PAINTING The finest surviving 
cycles of Late Byzantine mosaics and paintings are found in 
Istanbul s Kariye Camii, the former Church of the Savior in the 
Chora Monastery. (Kariye is the Turkish adaptation of the ancient 
Greek word chora , which refers to the countryside, that is, out¬ 
side the city walls; camii denotes a mosque, to which the building

was converted after the Turkish conquest, although the site is now 
a museum.) These particular mosaics and paintings represent the 
climax of the humanism that emerged in Middle Byzantine art. 
Theodore Metochites, a scholar and poet who was prime minister 
to the emperor Andronicus II, restored the church and paid for its 
decoration at the beginning of the fourteenth century. 

The wall paintings in the mortuary chapel attached to Kariye 
Camii are especially impressive. Some have suggested that because 
of the Empire s greatly reduced resources, murals often took the 
place of mosaics, but at Kariye Camii they exist on an even foot¬ 
ing and may even have been designed by the same artist. The main 
scene depicts the traditional Byzantine image of the Anastasis (fig. 
8.51), the event just before the Resurrection, which Western 
Christians call the Descent into Limbo or the Harrowing of Hell, 
clearly a fitting subject for the funerary setting. Surrounded by a 
mandorla, a radiant almond shape, Christ has vanquished Satan 
and battered down the gates of Hell. (Note the bound Satan at his 


feet, in the midst of a profusion of hardware; the two kings to the 
left are David and Solomon.) The central group of Christ raising 
Adam and Eve from the dead has tremendous dramatic force; 
Christ moves with extraordinary physical energy, tearing Adam 
and Eve from their graves, so that they appear to fly through the 
air—a magnificently expressive image of divine triumph. 

Such dynamism had been unknown in the Early Byzantine 
tradition, although the emotional force of Middle Byzantine 
painting might well have prepared the way for the vivacity of the 
Kariye Camii representations. Coming in the fourteenth century, 
this Late Byzantine style shows that 800 years after Justinian, 
when the Anastasis first appeared as a subject, Byzantine art 
still had all its creative powers. Thus, despite the diverse uses it 
served, its long chronological spread, and the different cultures 
and wide geographic areas it spanned, Byzantine art continued to 
preserve long-established traditions. Indeed, its durability verges 
on the immutable.

Islamic Art 



T he religion known as islam took form in the early seventh 

century on the Arabian peninsula (see Informing Art , page 283). A scant 
30 years after the death of its founder, the Prophet Muhammad (also 
known as the Messenger), in 632, Arab warriors had carried the new 
faith into much of todays Middle East. A century after the death of the 


Prophet, Islam had spread across Africa into Spain in the west, 
and into the Indus valley and Central Asia in the east (map 9.1). 
The original Arab adherents of Islam were eventually augmented 
by Berbers, Visigoths, Turks, and Persians. The cultural complex¬ 
ity of today s Islamic world existed almost from the beginning. As 
this phenomenal expansion took place, the inevitable clashing and 
combining of old cultures with the new religion gave birth to 
what was to become a vibrant tradition of Islamic art. 

Examining the formation of Islamic art gives us an intriguing 
look at the phenomenon of syncretism in art history, the process 
whereby a new artistic tradition emerges as a creative combina¬ 
tion of previously existing artistic ideas under the impetus of a 
new ideology. Just as the first Christian art developed out of a 
mixture of various preexisting classical and Near Eastern artistic 
ideas adapted to serve the needs of religious and then princely 
patrons (see Chapter 8), so the new Islamic art first took form as 
a series of appropriations of preexisting traditions from other cul¬ 
tures molded into a new synthesis, in the service both of the new 
Islamic religion and Islamic princes. 

The vast geographical and chronological scope of Islamic art 
means that it cannot be encompassed in simple definitions. Islam, 
the religion, is a significant element in Islamic culture, but Islamic 
art is far more than a religious art; it encompasses secular elements 

Detail of figure 9.8, Interior of prayer hall, Great Mosque of Cordoba, 
Spain 


and elements frowned upon, if not actually forbidden, by some 
Islamic theologians. As with all art, Islamic art encompasses and 
reflects the consistencies and contradictions of the society and 
culture that give it life. 

With all of its individual styles of time and place, and with the 
various sectarian differences within Islam, Islamic art nonetheless 
has certain unifying themes. The first of these is reverence for the 
Word—the Qur’an—and for the language of the Word—Arabic— 
as reflected in the art of beautiful writing. From the angular, hor¬ 
izontal kufic alphabet of early Islam (fig. 9.1) to complex cursive 
styles developed in later times, Islamic art, both secular and reli¬ 
gious, shows a remarkable affinity for the written word, be it 
scripture or secular narrative poetry (see Primary Source, page 281). 
A second theme is the development of artistic expression inde¬ 
pendent of the human figure. Given the mistrust of figural images 
in many Islamic religious traditions, we see in Islamic art sophis¬ 
ticated and complex vocabularies of vegetal, floral, and geometric 
designs used in conjunction with beautiful writing. A third theme 
is the equality of genres. To understand and appreciate Islamic art 
we need to discard the notion of the primacy of (figural) painting 
and (figural) sculpture in the European tradition. In the Islamic 
world, the arts of ceramics, metalware, weaving, and carving in 
precious materials rank with other mediums in an artistic spec¬ 
trum devoid of the formal hierarchy that in the West led to a dis¬ 
tinction between “fine arts” and “decorative arts.” In this sense, 
looking at Islamic art can be both enlightening and liberating.

THE FORMATION OF ISLAMIC ART 

Islamic art first took shape as a series of appropriations of pre¬ 
existing Graeco-Roman, Byzantine Christian, and Sasanian (see 
page 45) forms. These were molded into a new synthesis to serve 
the needs of the new Islamic religion and the desires and political 
goals of Islamic princes. The appropriation and adaptation of 
preexisting forms in the service of the emerging Islamic culture 
is particularly apparent in architecture. 

Religious Architecture 

The new religion required certain types of distinctive buildings, 
such as a place for community prayers that was visually identified 
with the new faith. The new Islamic rulers needed dwellings 
appropriate to their power and wealth. Eventually, the faith 
would also require commemorative buildings that memorialized 
great rulers, holy men, or historic events. As such, Islamic archi¬ 
tecture came to develop a rich variety of forms and genres, and a 
distinctive repertoire of decoration that became emblematic of the 
faith itself. 

DOME OF THE ROCK The earliest major Islamic building to 
have survived into our time, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem 
(fig. 9.2), is a case in point. After the Arabian cities of Mecca and 
Medina, Jerusalem was the holiest Islamic site. For the first 
Muslims, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem marked the place where 


God tested Ibrahim s faith by demanding the sacrifice of his first¬ 
born son Ismail. From the same site, according to later Islamic 
legend, the Prophet was taken by Gabriel on a mi’raj (spiritual 
journey) to experience both Heaven and Hell, Muhammad being 
the only mortal allowed to see these places before death. 

It is far from a coincidence that the Dome of the Rock is built 
on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, a place that was originally the site 
of the First (Solomon s) and Second (Herod s) Temples, the geo¬ 
graphic center of the Jewish faith (see page 235). It is also far from 
a coincidence that the domed silhouette and ringlike plan of the 
Dome of the Rock (fig. 9.3) echo the form of the sixth-century 
Byzantine shrine of the Holy Sepulcher (see fig. 8.12), marking 
the burial place of Jesus, just a few hundred yards to the west. The 
Dome of the Rock was constructed by artists and craftspeople, 
many of whom were undoubtedly local Christians or new con¬ 
verts to Islam, probably under orders from the Muslim caliph 
(from the Arabic khalifa , meaning “successor”) Abd al-Malik 
sometime around the year 690. Erected on a holy place that was 
also one of the highest points in the city, it eloquently proclaimed 
that Jerusalem was under the control of Islam. 

A closer look at the building shows both the nature of early 
Islamic syncretism and the impact of the Messenger s views on the 
visual arts. The ground plan of the building (see fig. 9.3), with its 
two ambulatories around the central bare rock, ideal for organiz¬ 
ing visits of large numbers of pilgrims to the shrine, recalls not 
only the Holy Sepulcher but also central-plan domed churches 
from early Christian times (see fig. 8.10). Just to the south of the

Al-Amuli (Iran, 14th Century) 

From Nafa’is al-Funun (The Beauty of Knowledge) 

Countless Islamic adages and anecdotes testify to the importance and 
beauty of elegant writing , the only art form to which Islamic theologians 
gave their unqualified approval Al-Amuli's encyclopedic treatise on 
knowledge cites the Qur'an in praising the art ofheautiful writing as the 
fulfillment of God's will , bringing respect and honor to the practictioner. 

T he art of writing is an honourable one and a soul-nurturing 
accomplishment; as a manual attainment it is always elegant, and 
enjoys general approval; it is respected in every land; it rises to emi¬ 
nence and wins the confidence of every class; being always held to be 
of high rank and dignity, oppression cannot touch it, and it is held in 


remembrance in every country, and every wall is adorned by its hand. 
Honour enough for it in this connexion is that the Lord of Lords, 
whose names are hallowed in His incontrovertible Revelation, 
swore—“By the pen, and what they write” (Qur. lxviii.l), and He 
spake these words: “Recite! Thy Lord is the most generous, who hath 
taught by means of the pen, Hath taught man what he knew not” 
(Qur. xcvi. 3-5). 



It is honour and exaltation enough for the writing pen 
For ever, that it was by the pen that God swore. 

The Prophet (peace be upon him!) said: “Beauty of handwriting is 
incumbent upon you, for it is one of the keys of mans daily bread.” 
A wise man has said: “Writing is a spiritual geometry, wrought by a 
material instrument. ”

Islam and Its Messenger 

I slam (an Arabic word denoting submission to God’s will) is the pre¬ 
dominant religion of a vast area of the world extending across Africa, 
Europe, and Asia, with many different ethnicities, cultures, languages, 
and forms of social and political organization. Muslims (those who 
submit) believe that Muhammad (ca. 570-632), an orphaned member 
of a major tribal group from the city of Mecca in the western Arabian 
peninsula, was chosen by God (in Arabic, Allah) to serve as God’s 
Messenger, or Prophet, to humanity. Muhammad is said to have 
received the Word of God as a series of poetical recitations (in Arabic, 
Qur’an), brought to him by the archangel jbra’il (Gabriel). Muhammad 
memorized and recited these poetic verses, and taught them to his fol¬ 
lowers. Organized into sura (chapters) and finally written down after 
the death of Muhammad in 632, these prayers, stories, exhortations, 
and commandments constitute the Qur’an, Islam’s sacred book. The 
Qur’an, together with official collections of hadith (remembrances) of 
the exemplary life of Muhammad as the Messenger, form the basis of 
Islamic religious practice and law. 

While the Prophet quickly gained adherents, those in power in 
Mecca were threatened by the challenges the new faith posed to their 
political and economic power, and in 622 he was forced to leave Mecca 
with a few of his followers, moving to the city of Medina some 1 90 
miles (300 km) to the north. Muhammad’s community, in constant 
conflict with the Meccans to the south, continued to grow, and more 
revelations were received. The Prophet’s house in Medina, constructed 
in the form of an open square, became the prototype for countless 
mosques in subsequent centuries. 

Islam was defined by Muhammad as the culmination of a prophetic 
tradition that began with God’s covenant with Ibrahim (Abraham). The 
Qur’an prominently mentions many of the major figures of the 
Hebrew Bible, such as Ibrahim, Musa (Moses), and Sulayman 


(Solomon), as well as the prophet ’Isa (Jesus) and his mother, Maryam 
(Mary). Islamic belief is fundamentally very simple: To become a Muslim, 
one repeats with conviction the phrase, “There is no God but God; 
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.” This Affirmation of Faith is the 
first of the so-called Five Pillars of Islam. The others are prayer (the five 
daily prayers and the major weekly prayer at noon on Friday, the 
Muslim Day of Congregation), fasting (abstention from food and drink 
during daylight hours during the lunar month of Ramadan), pilgrimage 
(in Arabic, hajj, a journey to Mecca during the lunar month of Dhu’l 
Hijja), and charity (institutionalized as a formal system of tithing, 
intended to benefit the sick and needy of the Islamic community). 

In addition, Islam proclaimed three other tenets that were to have a 
major impact on art. The first was the protected status of the “People 
of the Book”—Jews and Christians—in Muslim society, as ordained by 
God in the Qur’an. The second, based on several anecdotes from the 
Prophet’s life, is a profound mistrust of certain images—pictures and 
statues of humans and animals—as potentially idolatrous, a point of 
view Islam shares with Judaism, and which has occasionally influenced 
the history of Christian art as well. The third, held in common with 
Judaism and contrasting markedly with the Christianity of that time, 
was a high regard for literacy and the individual’s reading and study 
of Scripture, coupled through most of Islamic history with a reverence 
for the written alphabet—in the case of Islam, the Arabic alphabet, 
which in early Islam used an angular form of script known as kufic (see 
fig. 9.1). The beauty of the script, with its contrasting thin and thick 
lines, written from right to left in an almost rhythmic visual cadence, 
was deemed appropriate for the poetic words of God himself. These 
three factors, taken in the general context of Islamic belief and early 
Islamic political history, were to have a profound effect on the mold¬ 
ing of the Islamic artistic tradition. 




floral elements. Eventually, these design elements would form a 
distinctively Islamic repertoire of decoration. One was Arabic 
script used in the many religious inscriptions. Two others were a 
vocabulary of scrolling vines, leaves, and flowers distantly based 
on nature, and a range of repeating geometric patterns. Both the 
natural elements and the geometric patterns were staples of late 
Classical and Sasanian art. A fourth set of motifs consisted of 
jewels and jeweled objects, symbols of royalty. But in marked 
contrast to the Graeco-Roman and Christian religious art tradi¬ 
tions, nowhere in the Dome of the Rock do the forms of humans 
or animals appear. The inscriptions in the Dome of the Rock, 
taken from the Qur’an, were carefully chosen to underline the 
importance of the building itself, its symbolic location in a city 
holy to Jews and Christians as well as Muslims, and its place 
within a religion and society that saw itself as the culmination of 
the two earlier scriptural traditions, and which afforded tolerance 
and acceptance of both Christians and Jews. 

THE HYPOSTYLE MOSQUE Of the Five Pillars of Islam, the 
religious duty of prayer proved the most important in the 


development of Islamic architecture. In major cities such as 
Damascus, the Arab Umayyad caliphs of early Islam either built 
or converted from preexisting structures the first great buildings 
for Muslim public worship called mosques in English (from the 
Arabic masjid , meaning “place of prostration”). These first 
mosques, designed to contain the entire male population of a city 
during the noon prayer on Friday, recall the form of the 
Messenger s house in Medina, with a rectangular courtyard, usu¬ 
ally surrounded by covered arcades, and a larger hypostyle 
(many-columned) hall on the qibla, the side facing Mecca. The 
architecture emphasized the equality of all Muslims before God 
and the absence in Islam of an ordained clergy: There is little 
axiality in the early Arab mosques—no long straight pathway 
leading to an architectural focus visible throughout the structure. 
With prayer occurring directly between each worshiper and God, 
and no ordained clergy or canonized saints to provide interces¬ 
sion, the interior space of the early mosque was essentially deter¬ 
mined by practicality, not by ceremony. Thus, there was no place 
for music or processions; many doors were placed for maximum 
convenience of the daily coming and going of worshipers; and a

large centralized or axial space, so important for the drama of the 
Christian Mass, was deemed unnecessary. A simple minbar (pul¬ 
pit) served for the delivery of sermons after the Friday noon 
prayer, and an empty mihrab (niche) in the qibla wall was added 
to indicate the direction of Mecca (fig. 9.5). Mats of grass or 
rushes, and later woolen carpets, often covered the floors. These 
provided a clean place for the standing, bowing, kneeling, and 
prostration, with the brief touching of the forehead to the ground, 
while reciting prayers, that constitute the essence of Islamic wor¬ 
ship. Oil lamps provided illumination for the dawn and late 
evening prayers. Pools or fountains in the courtyard allowed for 
the ceremonial washing of hands and feet required before prayers. 
In later times, a tower, known in English as a minaret, advertised 
the presence of the mosque and served as a place from which to 
broadcast the call to prayer given five times a day by a muezzin , 
an individual usually selected for the beauty and power of his 
voice. And in some mosques a small platform called a dikka pro¬ 
vided a place for the muezzin to chant prayers aloud. 

Secular Architecture 

The advent of Islam did not mean the end of secular art in the 
Middle East. The early Islamic princely patrons, Arabs from the 
Umayyad ruling house, in addition to establishing the canonical 
form of the Islamic house of prayer, were also quickly seduced by 
the splendor of Sasanian and Graeco-Roman princely art. 
Although their urban palaces have not survived, they also con¬ 
structed luxurious and secluded palaces out in the desert, away 
from the metropolitan centers, and some of these have been redis¬ 
covered in relatively recent times. In addition to walled residences 
for ruler and courtiers in the traditional hollow square form of the 


Roman military encampment, the Umayyads built large and 
sumptuous bathhouses with halls for entertainment, often lav¬ 
ishly furnished with mosaic floors in a Late Roman style and dec¬ 
orated with pictorial and sculptural images of luxury Among the 
subjects depicted were the royal hunt, court musicians (fig. 9.6), 
the enjoyment of Roman-style baths, dancing courtesans, scenes 
from everyday life, and images of ancient derivation denoting

fertility, sexuality, and kingly prowess. The puritanical demands 
of religion thus immediately came into conflict with the age-old 
symbols of royal wealth, luxury, and entertainment. So great was 
the embedded power of the artistic imagery of kingship in the 
Middle East that it quickly made an impact on the material 
culture of the new Islamic ruling elite. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
ISLAMIC STYLE 

By 750, the Umayyad dynasty based in Roman Syria had been 
supplanted by the Abbasid dynasty centered in Mesopotamia. 
Here the new caliphs built their capital, called Baghdad, on the 
Tigris River, and later a vast palace city to the north of Baghdad at 
Samarra. The original Round City of Baghdad, the site of which 
lies under the present-day city, was largely abandoned and 
destroyed long before the Mongols sacked the city in 1258, but its 
powerful memory lived on in Arabic poetry and prose literature. 
Samarra s impressive mud-brick ruins still stretch for miles along 
the Tigris. Under Abbasid rule, the building of mosques in newly 
conquered areas proceeded apace across the now-extensive 
Islamic Empire. 

Religious Architecture 

Chief among the new structures were the large Abbasid con¬ 
gregational mosques that both practically and symbolically served 


as religious gathering places for prayers, sermons, and religious 
education. Large examples, many now in ruins, were built all over 
Iraq, and in Egypt and elsewhere. An archetypal example is the 
largely ninth-century congregational mosque at Kairouan, a city 
in what is now Tunisia established under the Abbasids. 

GREAT MOSQUE OF KAIROUAN Based like all major Arab 
mosques on the house of the Prophet in Medina and the four¬ 
square Mediterranean courtyard house, examples of which today 
still surround the structure, the Great Mosque of Kairouan consists 
of a rectangular courtyard surrounded by covered halls, a large 
hypostyle prayer hall, and a towering minaret (fig. 9.7). Two domes 
mark the area: in front of the mihrab and in the middle of the prayer 
hall facing the court. This aside, the multitude of entrances on three 
sides of the building, conceived to facilitate entry and exit for the 
five daily prayers, free the building from the domination of a cen¬ 
tral axis for processions of clergy; it is thus the very opposite of 
the Early Christian basilican church, organized for priestly and 
theatrical ritual. The simplicity of the mosque reflects the simplic¬ 
ity of Islamic prayer. The mosque s lack of both axiality and unin¬ 
terrupted interior space stems from the essential lack of hierarchy 
among worshipers. Each worshiper prays directly to God using a 
simple ritual formula usually completed in a few minutes. Artistic 
attention was lavished on the mihrab, of carved marble and 
ceramic tiles, and the minbar, elaborately carved of Indian teak. In 
the Kairouan mosque, a carved wooden screen, primarily a prod¬ 
uct of security rather than ritual needs, encloses a small area near 
the mihrab called the maqsura, where the ruler could pray alone.

Great Mosque of Cordoba, Spain 


GREAT MOSQUE OF CORDOBA Even farther to the west, in 
southern Spain, where the sole surviving prince of the extermi¬ 
nated Umayyad house founded an independent state after 750, a 
brilliant center of Islamic culture developed in the city of 
Cordoba, in al-Andalus (now Andalusia). By the tenth century, 
the Great Mosque of Cordoba, after a series of embellishments 
and enlargements, had become one of the most beautiful Islamic 
houses of worship. A typical Arab hypostyle hall, the interior of 
the Cordoba mosque became after several expansions a virtual 
forest of columns (fig. 9.8). Its characteristic “horseshoe” arcades 
are composed of arches using alternating red and white voussoirs, 
and include the additional element of one set of arches superim¬ 
posed above another on elongated imposts. This creates an 
impression of almost limitless space—this space is, however, 
composed of relatively small architectural elements repeated again 
and again. Compared with a Christian structure like Hagia Sophia 
(see figs. 8.27 and 8.29) or Old St. Peter s (see figs. 8.7 and 8.9), 
Cordoba has an equally large interior area, but there is no central¬ 
ized space for the sacred theater of the Christian rite. The mosque 
interior, including the maqsura area around the mihrab, was 
lavishly decorated with mosaic and carved stone. Tenth-century 
marble grilles (fig. 9.9) on the qibla wall present early examples of 
what we sometimes call geometric arabesque: The artist carves 
out of marble what is essentially a single straplike line that inter¬ 
twines, creating a characteristic openwork screen of stars and 
polygons. In the beauty of such artistic geometry many Muslims 
see a reflection of Gods creative hand in the universe. 

In addition to providing a community prayer hall, the large 
Islamic mosques such as the Great Mosque of Cordoba also often 
incorporated schools and universities, public baths, hospitals and 
medical schools, soup kitchens for the poor, hostels for travelers 
and merchants, public clocks (knowing the correct time was

essential for the variable timing of the five daily prayers), public 
toilets, and fountains serving as the public water supply for the 
immediate area. Endowments known as waqf, based on the 
income from rental properties, supported the many functions of 
mosques. Waqfs were also established for social-service institu¬ 
tions and for shrines that were founded independently of 
mosques. Artistic votive gifts made to such institutions, such as 
Qur’an manuscripts, lamps, beautiful wooden furniture, carpets, 
and other objects, were in theory protected in perpetuity, becom¬ 
ing part of the waqf itself. As a consequence, such institutions 
often became great magnets for works of art, accumulating over 
time important libraries and collections of beautiful furnishings. 

Luxury Arts 

On the outskirts of Cordoba, the Umayyads built another huge 
Islamic palace city known as Medina al-Zahra. A ruin today, the 


palace complex once included royal workshops for luxury objects 
such as silk textiles and carved ivory, used as symbols of royal 
wealth and power and given as royal ceremonial gifts. A small, 
domed pyxis (ivory box) made there for a tenth-century 
Umayyad prince (fig. 9.10) incorporates in its decoration a micro¬ 
cosm of Islamic royal imagery and symbolism, including depic¬ 
tions of falconry and hunting, sports, and court musicians, set 
amid lush carved vegetal ornament and a kufic inscription frieze. 
Such lavish objects had a symbolic importance far beyond their 
practical use as containers for jewelry or cosmetics. Their com¬ 
plex, many-layered iconography and their importance and sym¬ 
bolism as royal gifts continue to be studied today. 

In the eleventh century, Berber armies serving the Almoravid 
dynasty from North Africa razed Medina al-Zahra to its founda¬ 
tions, although they and their successors, the Almohads, also built 
significant monuments in the Maghreb (present-day Morocco and 
northwestern Africa) and in al-Andalus. But the growing and 
continual pressure of Christian reconquest from the north saw a 
dramatic decline in Muslim power in Spain. By the fourteenth 
century, the Almohad capital of Seville had fallen to the Christian 
kings of Spain, and Muslims working under Christian rule, 
known as Mudejares , continued Islamic artistic traditions under 
Christian patronage. (See The Art Historian's Lens , page 290.) 

ISLAMIC ART AND THE PERSIAN 
INHERITANCE 

In the central and western Islamic lands, from Spain to the west¬ 
ern Mediterranean littoral, Islamic arts developed within the 
geography and culture of the Graeco-Roman tradition; in the 
east, however, the situation was in many respects quite different. 
In Mesopotamia and Iran, the Arab Muslim conquerors encoun¬ 
tered the cultural sphere of the Sasanians, the heirs to over 1,000 
years of Persian civilization with an impressive tradition of art 
and architecture. This tradition included royal imagery of cere¬ 
monial pomp, warfare, and the royal sport of hunting (see fig. 
2.20), as well as large and impressive palace buildings. 

Architecture 

In the eastern Islamic world, following pre-Islamic architectural 
practice, brick rather than stone was the most common masonry 
construction material. In place of cylindrical columns, massive 
brick piers often provided vertical structural support in buildings, 
and heavy vaults rather than tiled wooden-beam roofs were often 
chosen to cover interior spaces. Islamic architecture in 
Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia reflects the available materi¬ 
als, earlier cultural traditions, and even the climate of those 
regions in distinctive ways. It also provides a curious blending of 
secular and religious buildings; just as the open arcaded courtyard 
helps to define both mosque and palace in the Islamic west, 
another form, known as the iwan, came to define both royal and 
religious structures in the east.

9.1 1 Schematic drawing of a generic Persian four-iwan mosque 


THE FOUR-IWAN MOSQUE One of the first large vaulted 
brick structures with one open side, known as an iwan, was con¬ 
structed by the Sasanian ruler Shapur I as an audience hall for 
his royal palace at Ctesiphon in Mesopotamia (see fig. 2.32). 


9.1 2 Tomb of the Samanids, Bukhara, Uzbekistan, ca. 901 


The form seems originally to have symbolized royal authority in 
Iran, and under Islam it was eventually incorporated into a new 
type of prayer structure, the four-iwan mosque, by placing one 
massive brick recess in the middle of each of the sides of the 
rectangular courtyard (fig. 9.11). From the twelfth century 
onward, the four-iwan courtyard was a standard feature of both 
mosques and religious schools of a type known as the madrasa 
throughout Iran and Islamic Central Asia. In most of Iran, as 
in Mesopotamia, brick was the preferred building material, 
and the vaults of Iranian mosques were supported by heavy 
brick piers. 

TOMB OF THE SAMANIDS In the aftermath of the Arab con¬ 
quest of Iran, the Persian cultural tradition gradually reasserted 
itself in many ways. One of the earliest surviving Islamic dynastic 
tombs was built in the early tenth century for the Persian Samanid 
dynasty in Bukhara, an eastern city beyond the Oxus River, today 
in Uzbekistan (fig. 9.12). This small cubic structure is in basic 
concept a hemispherical dome on four massive piers, evidently 
derived in part from the form of a Sasanian fire temple used for 
Zoroastrian worship. The dome is supported on the square cham¬ 
ber by means of four squinches in the corners, while the readily 
available and relatively humble material of brick is used to bril¬ 
liant effect, with various surface textures recalling woven reeds, 
kufic inscriptions, and what look like engaged columns in the cor¬ 
ners. While the Messenger had opposed all shrines and the promi¬ 
nent tomb structures of kings and saints, which he viewed as sug¬ 
gestive of polytheism or idolatry, the symbolism associated with 
dynastic kingship and the veneration of major religious figures in 
Islam meant that tombs and shrines were to figure prominently in 
the history of architecture throughout the Islamic world. 


Figural Art Forms in Iran 

The Iranian part of the Islamic world had inherited a rich tradi¬ 
tion of material culture, and the successive rulers of Iran, whether 
themselves Arab, Persian, Turkish, or Mongol in ancestry, fell 
under the seductive spell of the Persian heritage, which they com¬ 
bined with their Islamic beliefs and traditions. From the prosper¬ 
ous cities of tenth- and eleventh-century Iran there have survived 
beautiful ceramic wares decorated with maxims, good wishes, and 
prayers in beautiful calligraphy with figural and vegetal decora¬ 
tion, as well as some exceptional silk textiles and metal objects. 
The Seljuk Turkish invaders, who ruled Iran from the mid¬ 
eleventh century onward, not only built great mosques and tomb 
structures, but also ruled over a prosperous urban culture that 
among other things produced one of the richest known traditions 
of decorated ceramics. Using figural images of all kinds in a mul¬ 
titude of sophisticated techniques, including the use of a metallic 
pigment known as luster fired over the glaze and polychrome 
enamel decoration known as mina’i, these ceramic wares incorpo¬ 
rated for middle-class patrons a very diverse repertoire of scenes 
from Persian romances and mythology, themes from Sufism (the 
Islamic mystical religious tradition), and the now-familiar Islamic

royal images of hunting and other courtly pleasures. A favorite 
story finding its way into ceramics, metalwork, and book illustra¬ 
tion was that of the royal hunter Bahram Gur and his skeptical 
girlfriend, the harpist Azadeh. A mina’i plate shows two episodes 
of continuous narrative, with Azadeh on the camel with her royal 
lover, and then pushed off the beast after making a remark 
belittling the hero’s marksmanship (fig. 9.13). 

Also noteworthy was the practice of inlaying precious metals 
into brass or bronze, often incorporating human and animal 
images. This art form apparently began in Khurasan (formerly the 
northeastern part of Iran) in the twelfth century and gradually 
found its way west into upper Mesopotamia by the early thir¬ 
teenth century. The full repertoire of royal themes is represented 
in these opulent objects, in which on occasion even the letters of 
the inscriptions themselves take on human forms (fig. 9.14). Also 
created under the Iranian Seljuks were stucco relief sculptures 
incorporating the human figure. To what do we owe this burst of 
figural art in seeming contradiction to strict Islamic practice? 
Practical rather than dogmatic, Iranians under the Seljuks appar¬ 
ently believed that figural images did not necessarily have to be 
identified with polytheism or idolatry, but could usefully serve 
both secular and religious purposes without morally corrupting 
the viewer.

CHAPTER 9 ISLAMIC ART 289 




THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



Spanish Islamic Art and Europe in the Middle Ages 


I n 711, the combined Arab and Berber forces of the Muslim com¬ 
mander Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed over the Straits of Gibraltar. By 71 6, 
most of Spain was in Muslim hands. Under the rule of the Umayyad 
dynasty (751 -1 01 7), Cordoba became the capital of a prosperous, tol¬ 
erant, and powerful Muslim kingdom in Spain, in which Christians and 
Jews played important roles in cultural life. During the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries, in the aftermath of the fall of the Umayyads, succes¬ 
sive Berber invasions from North Africa, first by the Almoravids and 
then the Almohads, brought new Muslim dynastic patrons into Spain, 
who oversaw splendid new artistic production. But they also suffered 
a series of military defeats at the hands of the strengthening Christian 
powers in the north. Of the several small Islamic kingdoms that 
formed in the twilight of Muslim rule in Spain, one in particular, that 
of the Nasrids, ruling in Granada from 1 230 to 1 492, saw a last glori¬ 
ous flowering of the arts before its defeat by the Castilians and 
Aragonese united under Ferdinand and Isabella. 

The dominant Muslim style in the arts of southern Spain affected 
artistic production of non-Muslims in many complex ways. From the 
tenth through the twelfth centuries, in the hardscrabble mountainside 
principalities of the Christian north, builders built small churches and 
monasteries in the mozarab style, using the horseshoe arches, alter¬ 
nating colored voussoirs, and mosaics of colored stone they had seen 
in the Muslim south. At the same time, in the northern monasteries, 
artist-monks illustrated manuscripts of the Commentaries on the 
Apocalypse of Beatus of Liebana with paintings that also reflected the 
dominant Muslim style. Beyond the Pyrenees, along the medieval pil¬ 
grimage roads into France, aspects of the Muslim style even influenced 
French Romanesque art; the twelfth-century wooden doors of Le Puy 
Cathedral in France bore an elaborate kufic inscription in Arabic: 
mashallah —“may God protect this place.” 

After the Christian reconquest of central southern Spain gained 
momentum in the last part of the thirteenth century, artisans among 
the conquered Muslim peoples living under Christian rule, known as 
Mudejares, working under Catholic patrons, continued to produce 
works of art—buildings, carpets, ceramic wares, and ivories among 
them—in the Muslim style. The greatest monument of Mudejar art is 
the fourteenth-century Alcazar or royal palace of King Pedro of Castile 
in Seville, the style of which is remarkably similar to that of the 
Alhambra (see fig. 9.27), then being built in nearby Granada. Also 


noteworthy are the surviving Mudejar synagogues of Cordoba, 
Granada, and Toledo; with its Flebrew inscriptions intermingling with 
those in Arabic, the decoration of the Toledan synagogue of Samuel 
Halevy Abulafia, popularly known as El Transito (ca. 1 360), follows the 
Muslim style closely. It appears to demonstrate that important ele¬ 
ments of the Arabic-speaking Jewish population of Spain at the time 
felt themselves fully invested in the dominant artistic culture. 

Nationalistic European scholars once preferred to ignore or to 
deprecate this intermingling of cultures in medieval Spain, but recent 
scholarship and exhibitions have brought about renewed interest in 
the Spanish Muslim impact on Europe and in the nature of the flower¬ 
ing of Christian and Jewish culture during the period of convivencia 
(living together) in medieval Muslim Spain. The final expulsion of 
Muslims and Jews from Spain by the ethnic cleansing of Ferdinand and 
Isabella in the early sixteenth century brought most of this productive 
symbiosis to an unhappy end.

THE CLASSICAL AGE 

In the center of the Islamic world, in what some scholars term its 
classical age (roughly 800-1250), the power and influence of 
Mesopotamia gradually waned with the decline of the Abbasid 
caliphate. In 969, the Fatimids, a North African Arab dynasty 
claiming descent from the Messengers daughter Fatima, con¬ 
quered Fostat, the Abbasids’ major city in Egypt, and founded as 
their new capital the nearby city of Cairo. The Fatimids were 
Shi’ites—Muslims who believed that only descendants of 
Muhammad could legitimately lead the Islamic community. They 


took their name from the term shi’at’Ali (“the party of Ali”), 
Muhammads son-in-law, husband of Fatima, and father of the 
Prophets grandsons Hasan and Husein. Shi’ite Muslims them¬ 
selves were divided into several major and many minor sects, all 
of which opposed the basic political tenets of Sunni, or orthodox, 
Islam, where having the blood of the Messenger was not a pre¬ 
requisite for holding political power. 

The rise of the Fatimids in the tenth century coincided with a 
gradual weakening of Abbasid power and a decline in the 
caliphate authority based in Baghdad. By the eleventh century, 
the Seljuk Turks had moved westward out of Central Asia to gain 


290 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 









9.1 5 The al-Aqmar Mmosque, Cairo, ca. 1026 


control first in Iran and then in northern Mesopotamia and Asia 
Minor; around the same time, in 1099, the Norman warriors of 
the First Crusade captured Jerusalem. The Seljuks were Sunni 
Muslims; they fostered arts of all kinds and supported Sunni 
doctrine with the founding of many madrasa colleges for the 
teaching of Sunni law. In the late twelfth century, another Sunni 
dynasty, the Ayyubids, drove the Christians out of Jerusalem, and 
for a brief time also oversaw important developments in the arts. 

The Fatimid Artistic Impact 

Under the Fatimids, Egypt experienced a major artistic revival. 
The eleventh-century city walls of Cairo, incorporating the latest 
cutting-edge military technology, were constructed with stone 
stripped from the outer parts of the pyramids in nearby 
Giza. Two great urban palaces, decorated with figural images of 
music making, dancing, hunting, and royal ritual, were con¬ 
structed within the city, and elaborate parades and ceremonial 
processions proclaimed the dynasty’s power. Not one but two 
congregational mosques were constructed in Cairo under Fatimid 
rule, and smaller mosques served individual neighborhoods of 


the city, which by the twelfth century had expanded beyond its 
original walls. 

AL-AQMAR MOSQUE Among the most beautiful of the 
Fatimid mosques in Cairo is the small mosque known as 
al-Aqmar (fig. 9.15), built by a Fatimid noble. It was skillfully 
constructed on an irregular plot of land, with its off-axis faqade 
corresponding to the original street. In addition to the carved 
stone, Arabic inscriptions, and ornamental niches, we see to either 
side of the main portal a developed form of muqarnas, the dis¬ 
tinctive geometric, almost crystalline faceted decoration, com¬ 
posed of small nichelike forms, that eventually became an iconic 
form of Islamic decoration from the Atlantic to beyond the Oxus. 

TEXTILES AND IVORIES Under the Fatimids, a thriving mar¬ 
itime commerce between Egypt and Italy left its mark in the form 
of Islamic artistic influence on twelfth-century Italian architec¬ 
ture in port cities such as Palermo, Salerno, Amalfi, and Pisa. In 
addition, preexisting traditions of weaving, mostly carried on by 
indigenous Coptic Christians, continued to flourish alongside the 
production of new textiles incorporating silk imported from Iran

or China. In the twelfth century, Muslim artisans working in 
Palermo in Sicily, newly conquered by the Normans, created the 
elaborate embroidered cape of King Roger II (r. 1095-1154), with 
inscriptions in Arabic praising the Catholic ruler (fig. 9.16). It was 
used for many centuries in Habsburg coronations. Along with 
remarkable luster-painted ceramics, textiles, rock crystal, and 
glassware, Fatimid artists produced carved ivory objects signifi¬ 
cant both for their beauty and for the insights they provide into 
Fatimid court life. One of these, an ivory frame now in Berlin (fig. 
9.17), shows a multitude of energetic figures engaged in dancing, 
music making, hunting, wrestling, and drinking what can only be 
supposed to be wine, whose prohibition in the Qur’an did not 
preclude its use or depiction in the private customs and art of 
Islamic palaces. 

The Ayyuhids and the Seljuk Turks 
of Asia Minor 

It was during the Seljuk Turkish rule over central and northern 
Palestine, in 1099, that European warriors of the First Crusade 


captured Jerusalem, which remained briefly in Christian hands 
until its recapture in 1187 by the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din, 
known in the West as Saladin. The period of the Crusades was to 
last until the fourteenth century, when all but the last vestiges of 
crusader kingdoms disappeared from the eastern Mediterranean. 
Artistic cross-fertilization between Catholic Europe and the 
Muslim Middle East developed extensively during the entire 
period, and persisted long after the crusaders departed. The 
Ayyubids, a Kurdish dynasty originating in northern Syria, 
reconquered greater Syria and Egypt for Sunni Islam in the 
twelfth century, and their brief reign, ending in the mid-thirteenth 
century, produced a remarkable record of accomplishment in 
architecture and the arts. Ayyubid military architecture, such as 
the citadels of Aleppo and Cairo, embodied the latest military 
technology, and was to inspire many a European castle con¬ 
structed in the Romanesque and Gothic eras. Under the 
Ayyubids, the arts of inlaid metalwork, ceramics, and enameled 
glassware also flourished. 

To the east, in the twilight of the dynasty’s glory, the ancient 
Abbasid capital of Baghdad experienced by the early thirteenth

century a revival in the arts of the book. Such artists as Yahya ibn 
Mahmud al-Wasiti produced miniature paintings remarkable for 
their humor, observations of everyday life, and insights into 
human foibles, here seen illustrating a Maqamat manuscript (fig. 
9.18). (Maqamat means “stories” and this manuscript contains 50 
short stories.) 

To the north, the Seljuk Turks had finally entered the Asia 
Minor heartland of the Byzantine Empire after 1071. In the fol¬ 
lowing 200 years, with the full participation of the artists of both 
the Muslim and the Christian communities in the prosperous 
urban centers of Asia Minor, art and architecture flourished under 
what were known as the Seljuks of Rum (Rome). Craftspeople 
and artists from Iran, as well as from Syria and Egypt, served the 
lavish patronage of the Seljuk sultans. 


THE CARAVANSARAY The largest buildings constructed by 
the Seljuks in Asia Minor are a type of fortified wayside inn 
known in Turkish as han and in the West as caravansaray. Built 
at regular intervals along the main caravan routes linking the cities 
of Asia Minor, these buildings usually consisted of an outer court 
and a vaulted inner hall. The outer court had stables for pack 
animals, baths for travelers, a small mosque, and a kitchen. The 
inner hall, where goods could be stored and travelers slept, often 
had a tall dome on squinches, the pyramidal exterior of which 
could be seen along the highway from a great distance. The largest 
and most handsome of the Asia Minor hans, the Sultan Han, built 
between the cities of Konya and Aksaray around 1229 by Sultan 
Alaeddin Keykubad, has beautifully carved doorways leading 
into the courtyard and vaulted hall, and evidently employed in its 
construction the services of both local and Syrian stone carvers. A 
similar structure was built by the same ruler on the Kayseri-Sivas 
road and also called the Sultan Han (fig. 9.19); dozens of others 
are still today found in Turkey. They facilitated commerce 
throughout Asia Minor, where beautifully constructed and elabo¬ 
rately decorated mosques, madrasas, and palaces were built 
throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

LATER CLASSICAL ART 
AND ARCHITECTURE 

By the second decade of the thirteenth century, reports began to 
arrive in the Islamic lands of Central Asia, Iran, Egypt, Syria, and 
Asia Minor of an ominous power rising in the east. The eventual 
triumph of the Mongol successors of Genghis Khan brought 


devastation to much of the Islamic world east of the Medi¬ 
terranean. Some areas, such as Asia Minor, emerged relatively 
unscathed. Others, such as the Central Asian city of Bukhara 
(sacked and burned in 1220) and the Abbasid capital of Baghdad 
(sacked and destroyed in 1258), suffered untold losses in architec¬ 
tural monuments and artistic goods, as well as the even more seri¬ 
ous destruction of infrastructure, such as irrigation canals, roads, 
and social services. However, by the end of the thirteenth century,

294 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 
















the western Mongol rulers, known as Il-Khans, had converted to 
Islam, and their patronage and that of their successors brought 
about in Iran and its surrounding areas yet another period of 
artistic flowering, in which artists in western Asia were exposed 
to new artistic inspiration from China, flowing west through the 
Mongol domains on what historians now call the Silk Road, a 
5,000-mile (8,000-km) network of caravan routes from Honan 
(present-day Luoyang) through the Islamic world to Europe. 

Mongol rule in Central Asia and Iran was short-lived, but the 
artistic legacy of the Mongols continued under the Timurids, who 
by the late fourteenth century had established their empire in 
the former Mongol lands and produced a brilliant court tradition, 
the legacy of which was eventually felt from the eastern 
Mediterranean to central India. Far to the west and south, after 
1260, Sunni Mamluks in Syria and Egypt, inheritors of the 
Fatimid Shi’ite capital of Cairo, set about their own symbolic 
appropriation of the land, with a new architecture of tall domes 
and complex minarets, and an artistic economy that mixed the 
Turkic (of the people who originated in central Asia and migrated 
to northern, central and western Eurasia, including the Anatolian 
peninsula) tastes of the ruling class with indigenous Egyptian 
traditions. Trade between Cairo and Italy was brisk, and Mamluk 
artistic production sometimes even reflected the commercial 
attractiveness of Mamluk goods in Europe. 

Mongol Patronage 

In the realms of art and architecture, the Mongols built on what 
had come before them. The legacy of later Arab book illustration, 
which had flowered in Iraq in the decades before the Mongol sack 
of Baghdad in 1258, lived on in elements of the emergent Iranian 
tradition of miniature painting that began in the first half of the 
fourteenth century under Mongol patronage in their capital of 
Tabriz in northwest Iran. Artists in Tabriz produced paintings in 
a new style that incorporated aspects of Chinese brush painting 
and Chinese landscape. In other Mongol centers, Chinese motifs 
and raw materials contributed to a revival of silk weaving, and 
preexisting traditions of inlaid metalwork and luster-painted 
ceramics developed in new directions. Like almost all foreigners 
who had conquered Iran from the time of Alexander the Great, 
the Mongol rulers quickly became “Persianized,” commissioning 
illustrated manuscripts of the Persian national epic, the Shah- 
nameh or “Book of Kings,” and building four-iwan brick 
mosques and high-domed tomb structures in the Persian style. 
The nature of Mongol patronage in Iran can be seen in the tomb 
structure built by the Il-Khan Oljeytu (r. 1304-1317). The son of 
a Sunni father and a Christian mother, Oljeytu founded a new 
capital in Sultaniya, bringing artists and builders from all over his 
realms to embellish it. At the center of his capital stands a huge 
structure with a massive pointed dome covered with turquoise 
blue tiles, the royal mausoleum of Oljeytu (fig. 9.20). With its 
painted interior decoration of carved and painted stucco (fig. 9.21) 
and elaborate tile decoration, it is unprecedented in size and scale 
for an Islamic shrine or tomb. This great domed building in

Sonia Seherr-Thoss 

Sultaniya represents the grandiose artistic aspirations of the Il- 
Khans, as well as their enlightened patronage of artistic innova¬ 
tion within preexisting Persian traditions. 

Timurid Patronage 

After the death of the last ruler of the short-lived Il-Khan dynasty 
in 1337, Iran and Islamic Central Asia broke up into smaller 
principalities, one of which, that of the Jalayrid dynasty, kept the 
tradition of Mongol painting alive in Tabriz and Baghdad. By the 
late fourteenth century, another Turko-Mongol power had risen 
beyond the Oxus, this time under the rule of the strategic genius 
Timur (r. ca. 1370-1405), known in the West as Tamerlane. 

ARCHITECTURE AND ITS DECORATION In his capital 
city of Samarkand, Timur built in the 1390s a gigantic congrega¬ 
tional mosque, the largest four-iwan mosque in the Iranian tradi¬ 
tion, and his palace of Aq Saray in his nearby birthplace was built 


CHAPTER 9 ISLAMIC ART 295 











9.22 Madrasa of 
Ulugh Beg, Samarkand, 
Uzbekistan, ca. 1435 


on an equally gargantuan scale. The artistic aspirations of the 
Timurid dynasty reached their climax in the fifteenth century. At 
Herat, which became the main capital under the rule of Timur s 
son Shah Rukh (r. 1405-1447), Timurs grandson Baysunghur 
founded a royal library—in fact, a royal design studio—that, in 
addition to producing beautiful books decorated with illumina¬ 
tions, miniature paintings, and calligraphy, served as a central 
source of designs for many other artistic mediums, drawing on 
the artistic legacy of the Jalayrids as well as the arts of China and 
Central Asia. 

To the north in Samarkand, in present-day Uzbekistan, 
another of Timurs grandsons, Ulugh Beg, founded (ca. 1420) a 
major astronomical observatory as well as one of the most impor¬ 
tant Timurid madrasa colleges (fig. 9.22). Ulugh Beg s college has 
a massive iwan before its main portal and two cylindrical 
minarets. Elaborate, carefully constructed mosaics of colored tiles 
in geometric and vegetal patterns lavishly decorate the entire 
facade. Ceramic building decoration in Central Asia under the 
Timurids and their immediate predecessors developed a rich vari¬ 
ety and complexity equaled but never surpassed in the subsequent 
history of art in the region of Iran. 

BOOK ILLUSTRATION It was in Herat, in the twilight of the 
Timurid dynasty at the end of the fifteenth century, that the long 
and complex history of Persian book painting saw one of its most 
glorious chapters. In the 1480s and 1490s, the great master Behzad 
and his colleagues brought about a series of refinements in Islamic 
painting that have become legendary. Behzad himself had not 


only a sensitivity to the lyrical and heroic themes of Persian poetic 
texts, but a keen eye for the world around him. In many of his 
paintings made to illustrate verse texts, such as this illustration 
from a manuscript of the Bostan (Poetic Garden ) of Sa’di, it is the 
everyday heart of Herat that we see so masterfully depicted (fig. 
9.23). In a scene outside a mosque, the high point of view allows 
us to look into the courtyard, while at the doorway a rich man 
encounters a beggar, and another man washes at a fountain. 
Behzad s spatial and narrative clarity, overlapping elements in 
ingenious ways to give a sense of three dimensions while portray¬ 
ing all of his protagonists in the same scale, brings a new power to 
these small paintings, the small size of which does not restrict 
their generous pictorial space, complex settings, and large cast of 
characters. 

Mamluk Patronage 

In the central Islamic lands, only one power had successfully 
repulsed the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century. When 
the last Ayyubid ruler of Egypt died in 1250, his wife married her 
husband s leading general, a Mamluk, or slave soldier, of Kipchak 
Turkish origin named Baybars, who became ruler in 1260. That 
year, at the Battle of Ain Jalut (in what is now northern Israel), a 
Mamluk army defeated the Il-Khan s Mongol troops. As a result, 
Egypt and much of Syria remained free of Mongol rule under the 
various Mamluk dynasties, which ruled from Cairo and 
Damascus, from 1250 until the conquest of Cairo by the Ottoman 
Turks in 1517.

ARCHITECTURE It is easy to see an evolutionary progression 
from the art of Egypt in Fatimid and then Ayyubid times into the 
Mamluk reign. Mamluk patronage was at times quite lavish, and 
most of the artistic character of todays Cairo comes from the 
Mamluk period. Working within the confines of often irregularly 
shaped plots of urban land in the crowded Egyptian metropolis, 
builders under Mamluk patronage created mosques, madrasas, 
tombs, and a distinctive combination of public libraries and water 
fountains. These works are characterized by a new style of elabo¬ 
rately decorated high domes, complex multibalconied minarets, 
and lavish decoration incorporating both carving and multicol¬ 
ored marble mosaic paneling. As Sunni Muslims living in the 
shadow of the Shi’ite Fatimid past, the Turkish-speaking 
Mamluks, often unable to speak or write Arabic, not only built 
mosques, but also a very large number of madrasas, or institutions 
of higher education, to serve the local populace. 

The largest and most impressive of these is the madrasa and 
tomb of Sultan Hasan (fig. 9.24). It was constructed between 
1354 and 1361 by the otherwise undistinguished Mamluk sultan 
Nasir ad-Din al-Hasan, into whose state coffers had flowed a 
torrent of riches as a result of the high mortality of the mid¬ 
century outbreak of Black Death, which left many large estates 
without heirs. Designed as four separate colleges within one 
building (fig. 9.25), each devoted to one of the four major schools 
of Islamic jurisprudence, the mammoth structure houses a 
mosque in the qibla iwan of its huge four-iwan courtyard, as well 
as classrooms, dormitory rooms, and, on the south side behind 
the qibla wall, the gigantic domed tomb of Sultan Hasan himself. 
Decorated with varicolored marble mosaic paneling, with spec¬ 
tacular carved portals, bronze doors inlaid with silver and gold, 
and furnishings such as a marble minbar and muezzin platform 
and a walnut Qur’an lectern inlaid with ebony and ivory, the 
madrasa and tomb of Sultan Hasan show the artistic aspirations 
of the Mamluks to be equal to those of their Mongol rivals to 
the northeast in size, expense, and beauty. Right down to the 
Ottoman conquest in 1517, Mamluk patrons in Egypt and Syria 
continued to produce a large number of beautiful buildings, 
including the famous tombs that today crowd Cairo’s Northern 
Cemetery. 

ENAMELED GLASS, METALWORK, AND CARPETS 

Mamluk patronage in Syria and Egypt also inherited a tradition of 
enameled glass that had begun under the Ayyubids. By the early 
fourteenth century, Mamluk glass vessels enameled with bright 
colors had become world-famous. Various Mamluk nobles com¬ 
missioned glass oil lamps destined to be hung in their tombs and 
mosques, and artists incorporated the patrons’ blazons, or coats 
of arms, in the decoration (fig. 9.26). Under the Mamluks, by 
around 1300, the art of inlaying silver and gold into bronze and 
brass had also reached its apogee in Islamic art. In later Mamluk 
times, from the fifteenth century onward, the Mamluk realms saw 
the production of spectacular carpets that were exported to 
Europe, where, like the enameled glass, they were highly prized. 
(See Materials and Techniques , page 301.) 


Nasrid Patronage: The Alhambra 

By the mid-fourteenth century, most of Muslim al-Andalus had 
fallen to the Christian reconquest; Seville and Cordoba were part 
of the Castilian domains, and only the mountain kingdom of 
Granada in the south in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada 
remained under Muslim control, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty. On 
a flat hill towering over the city of Granada, the Nasrid monarchs 
built a palace known to them as al-Qasr al-Hamra (The Red 
Palace), and to history as the Alhambra. Originally conceived, as 
most Islamic palaces were, as a series of pavilions and smaller 
buildings constructed around one or more garden courtyards, the 
Alhambra incorporated metaphors for Paradise on earth. The 
inscriptions on its walls, some of which were written by one of 
the great Arab poets of the time, form a hymn of praise to the 
palace itself. Although what remains today is only a small frag¬ 
ment of the original palace, the rest having been consumed by a 
mammoth Renaissance palace and an equally huge Franciscan 
monastery, the most beautiful of the Alhambra’s surviving court¬ 
yards, known as the Court of the Lions, gives us a vivid picture of

An Order from the Imperial Court 

By spring 1572 the building of the sultan's mosque in Edirne was well 
under way. From the royal palace, the sultan took a very close interest 
in the progress of a ffairs, an approach that seems to have bordered on 
micromanagement. He even dictated what inscriptions were to he 
placed in what locations in the building. 


To the Architect in Chief: 

For the inscriptions that are currently needed for my noble mosque 
in Edirne that I have ordered to be built, you have requested the 
services of the calligrapher Molla Hasan. Now this individual has 
been retained and dispatched for the above-mentioned business. 
I have ordered that, upon receipt and by fulfillment of this order, you 
show him the places in the noble mosque where he will prepare suit¬ 
able and appropriate inscriptions, whether they be executed on tiles, 
or be simple painted inscriptions.

the center of the court, a large stone basin carried on the backs of 
twelve lions holds a playing fountain, the pressurized water 
coming from the distant mountains. From the basin, four water 
channels reflecting the four rivers of Paradise carry the water into 
four pavilions on the sides of the courtyard. In its elaborately 
carved stucco, once vividly polychromed, and in its delicate and 
elaborate muqarnas and intricate inscriptions carried on slender 
multiple or single columns, the richly textured and almost 
gravity-defying architecture of the Alhambra creates an awesome 
impression. The Alhambra was to influence artistic consciousness 
for centuries to come, finding heirs in both sixteenth- 
century Morocco and in nineteenth-century Europe and the 
United States. 


THE THREE LATE EMPIRES 

In later Islamic times, three large empires formed major centers of 
Islamic artistic accomplishment: the Ottoman, the Safavid, and 
the Mughal. At the end of the thirteenth century, in a corner of 
Asia Minor just a dozen or so miles from the Byzantine capital of 
Constantinople, a vassal of the declining Seljuk sultanate named 
Osman (r. ca. 1281-1324) established a tiny frontier principality 
hosting warriors eager to expand the realms of Islam at the 
expense of the Christians. From this seed grew a mighty empire, 
which by the mid-sixteenth century had almost turned the 
Mediterranean into a Turkish lake, ruling from Cairo to the out¬ 
skirts of Vienna, and from Algiers to northwestern Iran. It lasted 
until 1922. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, five decades

The Oriental Carpet 

N o artistic product of the Islamic world is better known outside its 
original home than the pile carpet, popularly called the oriental 
carpet. Carpets are heavy textiles meant to be used essentially in the 
form in which they leave the weaver’s loom. That is, they are not cut 
or tailored, and they are usually woven as complete artistic works, not 
as goods sold by the yard. Their uses vary extensively from floor 
coverings to architectural decorations, from cushions and bolsters to 
bags and sacks of all sizes and shapes, and from animal trappings to 
religious objects (prayer rugs that provide a clean place for Muslim 
prayer). They can be used as secular or religious wall decoration. 
Carpet weaving is a deeply embedded art in the culture of many 
Islamic societies. It is a part of the socialization of young women, who 
form the bulk of Islamic artist-weavers. It is found not only in nomadic 
encampments and villages, but also in urban commercial weaving 
establishments and, in former times, in special workshops that func¬ 
tioned directly under court patronage in Islamic lands. 

There are several different techniques for weaving Islamic carpets, 
but the best-known is the pile carpet, in which row after horizontal 
row of individual knots of colored wool are tied on vertical pairs of 
warp yarns, and each row of knots is then beaten in place by a beater, 
a tool that resembles a combination of a comb and a hammer, and 
subsequently locked in place by the passing of one or more horizon¬ 
tal weft yarns. The ends of each knot protrude vertically on the upper, 
or “right,” side of the carpet, giving it a thick pile surface, at once 
highly reactive to light, conducive to rich color effects, and providing 
excellent insulation from cold floors or the earthen ground of a 
nomad’s tent. 

The carpet form probably arose originally among pre-lslamic 
nomadic peoples in Central Asia. The bulk of surviving early Islamic 
carpets, thought to have been woven from the thirteenth through 
fifteenth centuries, show connections in both design and technique to 
a nomadic past. In the fifteenth century, the so-called carpet design 



Rows of individual knots, tied over two 
vertical warps, are tied, cut, and tightly 
hammered in place and locked in by a 
pair of horizontal wefts

revolution led to the production of Islamic carpets in designs that were 
created by court artists, and then translated into instructions for car¬ 
pet weavers. These carpets were often used by royalty or given as gifts 
to royalty. 

The design of a carpet, like that of a picture made on an ink-jet 
printer, is created out of a grid of colored dots consisting of small indi¬ 
vidual knots of colored wool that when viewed together form a design. 
Some carpets are fairly coarse in weave, and use a long pile; such 
carpets tend to use bold geometric designs and brilliant colors. Other 
carpets, such as those produced after designs by court or commercial 
artists, may use a much finer weave (in extreme cases, more than 
2,000 knots in a square inch) and a short pile to reproduce curvilinear 
ornamental designs, calligraphy, or even depictions of humans and 
animals (see fig. 9.32) in large carpets. The symbolism of carpets may 
be extremely complex, varying from totemic designs of tribal signifi¬ 
cance to figural designs with arcane religious or secular meanings. 

Exported to Europe since the fourteenth century, Islamic pile car¬ 
pets have historically formed an East-West cultural bridge. In Europe, 
they not only decorated the palaces of the nobility and the houses of 
wealthy urban merchants, but were also used in churches, religious 
shrines, and as part of both secular and religious ceremonies. Islamic 
carpets, as prized works of art and signs of status and wealth, were 
frequently depicted in European paintings (see figs. 1 4.1 4, 1 4.21, and 
20.36). Carpet weaving continues to flourish in the Middle East today. 
Demand for Islamic carpets in both East and West has actually 
increased in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. 


CHAPTER 9 ISLAMIC ART 301 


MATERIALS AND TEC 














after the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople and made it 
their capital, a charismatic Shi’ite warrior from northwestern Iran, 
the Safavid prince Ismail (r. 1501-1524), founded another great 
empire. In its successive capitals of Tabriz, Qazvin, and Isfahan, 
the Safavid state was to bring many genres of art to new levels of 
accomplishment within the Islamic world. Until the middle of the 
eighteenth century, the Safavids remained major rivals of the 
Ottomans, and their distinctive styles in architecture, book paint¬ 
ing, and the applied arts of carpets and textiles influenced their 
neighbors to both west and east. In 1526, a Turkish prince from 
Central Asia named Babur (r. 1526-1530) invaded northern India. 
After a series of reverses and recoveries, Baburs grandson Akbar 
the Great (r. 1556-1605) firmly established the Mughal dynasty in 
the subcontinent. Through the next century and a half, the fabled 
palaces and monuments of the Mughal capital cities of Delhi, 
Agra, and Fatehpur Sikri, visited by Muslim and European trav¬ 
elers alike, became a byword throughout the world for the beauty, 
luxury, and opulence of the Islamic arts. 

The Ottomans in Europe and Asia 

At first there was little to distinguish what became known as the 
Ottoman Empire (in Italy, Osman was known as “Ottomano”) 
from more than a dozen other small Islamic states that filled the 
vacuum left by the collapsing Seljuk power in Asia Minor. But, by 


1357, the Ottomans had crossed the Dardanelles, a narrow strait 
between Europe and Asia, into the Balkans, and eventually by 
1453 they had claimed the elusive prize of Constantinople itself, 
the second Rome and capital of Eastern Christianity. In this, their 
capital city, popularly renamed Istanbul, and in their summer and 
military capital of Edirne, 120 miles (190 km) farther west into 
Europe, the Ottomans used their enormous economic power to 
patronize art and architecture on an unprecedented scale. 

ARCHITECTURE To their Topkapi Palace in Istanbul flocked 
artists from Iran, Egypt, the Balkans, and even from western 
Europe, while in the sixteenth century the architect known to 
posterity as Sinan the Great presided over an architectural estab¬ 
lishment that saw the erection of hundreds of bridges, hans, 
madrasas, palaces, baths, markets, and mosques. The great impe¬ 
rial mosques of the Ottomans paid homage to the traditional Arab 
mosque by incorporating an atriumlike arcaded courtyard into 
their design. However, the vast interior space and daring engi¬ 
neering of Justinians Hagia Sophia (see figs. 8.28 and 8.29), in 
combination with their own well-developed traditions, provoked 
an architectural response that made Ottoman mosques, often 
built in climates with extensive rainfall and winter snows, vastly 
different from mosques of the Arab or Iranian traditions. In 1572, 
Sinan built for Sultan Selim II (r. 1566-1574) in Edirne a huge 
imperial mosque that the architect considered his masterpiece

(fig. 9.28). The courtyard with surrounding arcades and central 
fountain recalls the typical Arab mosque plan, but the huge lead- 
covered dome and the four pencil-thin triple-balconied minarets 
proclaim the Ottoman architectural style, while the vast interior, 
with its eight huge piers supporting a dome almost 197 feet high 
and over 108 feet in diameter, shows a unified and clearly delin¬ 
eated space (fig. 9.29) that is completely different both from the 
Arab hypostyle mosque with its fragmented space, and from the 
Hagia Sophia with its mysterious structural and spatial ambiguity 
In Sinans work, the structural components—the muscles and 
sinews, as it were—rather than being hidden, are a primary source 
of the buildings 5 visual appeal. The Ottomans preferred an austere 


exterior of bare whitish stone contrasting with the dark-gray lead 
sheets used for waterproofing the domes and semidomes of their 
structures, while the interiors frequently incorporated beautiful 
polychrome tiles with designs of strikingly naturalistic flowers. 
(See Primary Source, page 300.) 

THE OTTOMAN COURT STYLE By 1500, the Ottomans, like 
the Timurids before them, had developed a royal design studio, 
called the “house of design, 55 that served as the central focus of 
royal artistic patronage. It reached its zenith under the patronage 
of Suleyman I, “The Magnificent 55 (r. 1520-1566), his son Selim II 
(r. 1566-1574), and his grandson Murad III (r. 1576-1595).

Among the many artistic innovations to emerge from this 
complex of artists working in almost every conceivable medium 
and genre is a style of ornament called by some saz, taking its 
name from a legendary enchanted forest, and by others hatayi— 
that is, “from Cathay,” or “China.” Created in part by an emigre 
artist from Tabriz named Shah Kulu, who was head of the 
Ottoman royal studio by the mid-sixteenth century, the style is 
typified by energetic and graceful compositions of curved leaves 
and complex floral palmettes linked by vines that appear to over¬ 
lap and penetrate each other, sometimes embellished with birds or 
strange antelopelike creatures. The saz or hatayi style is found in 
ceramic wares, manuscript illuminations, carpets, silk textiles, 
freehand drawings executed for the albums of royal collectors, 
and some remarkable blue and turquoise paintings on tile, proba¬ 
bly from the hand of Shah Kulu himself (fig. 9.30). Ottoman 
ceramics and silks were exported in large quantities to Russia and 
Europe, where along with the much-prized carpets from Asia 
Minor they were quickly absorbed into European material culture. 

The Safavid Period in Iran 

Shortly after 1500, Ismail, a charismatic prince descended from a 
family of venerated Shi’ite clerics in northwestern Persia, declared 
himself the Safavid shah (or king) of Iran. Quickly overrunning 
much of the formerly Timurid domains, the young ruler estab¬ 
lished his capital in the city of Tabriz in northwestern Iran, for¬ 
merly the capital of two provincial Turkmen dynasties (a Turkic 
people who occupied parts of Central Asia), precariously close to 
the eastern reaches of the Sunni Ottoman Empire. There, under 
Ismail (r. 1501-1523) and his successor Tahmasp (r. 1524-1576), 
who in 1548 moved his capital to the strategically more secure 
Qazvin to the east, the arts flourished. 

BOOK ILLUSTRATION AND CARPETS! TABRIZ Early in 
the sixteenth century, the aged painter Behzad was brought from 
the east to Tabriz, where his influence, combined with the indige¬ 
nous Turkmen painting style of pre-Safavid times, brought about 
a remarkable artistic synthesis. In the hands of one of the great 
geniuses of Islamic art, the Turkmen-born artist Sultan- 
Muhammad—it was not uncommon for artists in royal ateliers to 
incorporate honorifics like shah (king), sultan (ruler), or aqa 
(noble) into their names—the new Safavid style of miniature 
painting reached fresh heights in expressiveness as well as tech¬ 
nique. One of the painter s most appealing creations is an illustra¬ 
tion painted with opaque watercolors on paper in Tabriz around 
1529 for a royal manuscript of a divan , or collection of poems, by 
the fourteenth-century poet Hafiz, utilizing the theme of heav¬ 
enly and earthly intoxication, a favorite motif of mystical Persian 
poetry (fig. 9.31). A group of elderly professors from a religious 
college are shown in various stages of disorderly intoxication, 
accompanied by servants, some fawning and others apparently 
terrified, while a group of strangely attired and caricatured musi¬ 
cians provides background music. On the roof of the building 
angels join in the revelry, while on the balcony the pie-eyed poet

himself struggles to write his poem. Using an incredibly fine 
brushstroke, and a thick white application of paint to create the 
textures of the white silk Safavid turbans, with their characteristic 
colored batonlike ornaments sticking out the top, Sultan- 
Muhammad has created a work that reminds us that Islamic civi¬ 
lization is no stranger to humor or to the enjoyment of a good 
time, both metaphorically and literally. 

The new style in book painting, with its brilliant colors, 
expressive faces, and great variety of body types, often set in a 
landscape filled with flowers or in a lavish architectural setting, 


was immediately transferable to other mediums. A carpet woven 
somewhere in the Safavid domains in the second half of the six¬ 
teenth century shows the application of the figural style of minia¬ 
ture painting to a symbolically complex composition of royal and 
heavenly motifs (fig. 9.32). It incorporates the royal hunt, the 
enjoyment of wine in a paradiselike setting, and a host of birds and 
animals. These forms are subject to a complex layering of symbol¬ 
ism, often intermingling the sacred and the profane, that reflects 
the strong role of Sufi mysticism in Safavid culture, as well as an 
age-old Persian love of wine, poetry, and beautiful possessions.

ARCHITECTURE! THE PLANNED CITY OF ISFAHAN By 

the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Safavid capital 
had been moved once again to the old city of Isfahan in the 
Persian heartland. There, the energetic and powerful Abbas I 
(r. 1588-1629) laid out to the south of the original city a new city 
with large public spaces and broad avenues, with palaces for the 
nobility and a quarter for Armenian Christian merchants. The 
splendor and prosperity of this new Isfahan drew commerce and 
travelers from all over the world, and the luxury goods sold in its 
bazaars, from silks and ceramics to metalware and carpets, 
together with the beauty of its gardens and the richness of its 
inhabitants, led to a famous Persian adage: “Isfahan is half the 
world. ” At one end of a huge open square known as the maidan, 
itself oriented with the North Star, Shah Abbas built his Royal 


Mosque (fig. 9.33). Because the qibla lies to the southwest, facing 
Mecca, the mosque has to be at an entirely different orientation 
than the maidan. An ingenious 45-degree turn beyond the main 
portal deftly accomplishes a directional accommodation, leading 
into the huge open courtyard of the mosque, with its enormous 
domed chamber behind the qibla iwan, and all visible surfaces 
completely covered in brilliantly colored tiles. 

The shops that line the sides of the maidan all contributed 
rents to the waqf or endowment of the mosque, and in the middle 
of the west side of the maidan, Shah Abbas built a palace from the 
balcony of which he could watch processions and sporting events 
in the square itself. The rest of the new city of Isfahan consisted 
in large part of spacious gardens surrounding the pavilionlike 
palaces of the Safavid nobility.

The Mughal Period in India 

In 1526, Babur, who claimed descent from the Mongol Timur 
(hence the dynastic name “Mughal”), defeated a combined army 
of Hindu princedoms in northern India to establish the Mughal 
dynasty in the subcontinent. Although India had had an Islamic 
presence in Delhi since around 1200, the Mughal Empire was to 
bring a new flowering of Islamic art and architecture to the 
subcontinent. Centered in the capital cities of Agra, Delhi, and 


Fatehpur-Sikri, the scene of building and the production of works 
of art on a mammoth scale, the Mughal style built on an artistic 
combination of Central Asian, Safavid Persian, and indigenous 
Hindu art and culture. Under Babur’s grandson Akbar the Great 
(r. 1556-1605), himself an unusually capable and charismatic ruler, 
the style took on its distinctive form. Akbar was a remarkably tol¬ 
erant ruler, fascinated by Hinduism, interested in Persian poetry 
and art, and a patron of one of the major Indian Sufi orders.

Abd M-Hamid Lahori 
(d. 1654) 

From Padshah Nama (Book of the Emperor) 

Abd al-Hamid Lahori was official court historian to Shah Jahan , who 
huilt the Taj Mahal as a monument to the memory of his beloved wife 
Mumtaz Mahal The Padshah Nama was written in three volumes , 
each corresponding to a decade in Shah Jahan 5 reign. Be fore he could 
finish the third volume , Lahori was taken ill , and the work was com¬ 
pleted by his younger colleague Muhammad Waris in 1657. This excerpt 
is from a much longer discussion of the building of the monument , 
together with an elaborate description of the tomb itself the outbuild¬ 
ings ,, and the surrounding gardens. 

A t the beginning of the fifth year of the exalted accession 
(January, 1632), the excavation was started for the laying of the 
foundation of this sublime edifice, which is situated overlooking the 
Jumna river flowing adjacent to the north. And when the spade- 
wielders with robust arms and hands strong as steel, had with unceas¬ 
ing effort excavated down to the water-table, the ingenious masons 
and architects of astonishing achievements most firmly built its 
foundation with stone and mortar up to the level of the ground. 


And on top of this foundation there was raised a kind of platform 
of brick and mortar in one solid block, measuring 374 cubits long by 
140 wide and 16 high, to serve as the plinth of this exalted mau¬ 
soleum—which evokes a vision of the heavenly gardens of Rizwan 
and epitomizes, as it were, the holy abodes of Paradise. 

And from all parts of the empire, there were assembled great num¬ 
bers of skilled stonecutters, lapidaries, and inlayers, each an expert in 
his art, who commenced work along with other craftsmen. In the 
middle of this platform plinth—which ranks [in magnificence] with 
the heavenly Throne of God—there was constructed another solid 
and level platform. In the center of the second platform, the building 
of this heaven-lofty and Paradise-like mausoleum was constructed on 
the plan of a Baghdadi octagon, 70 cubits in diameter, on a base plinth 
one cubit in height. 

Situated in the exact center of the building, the domed hall over the 
sepulcher of that recipient of divine grace has been finished with 
white marble within and without. From the floor to the curvature, the 
hall under the dome is octagonal in shape, with a diameter of 22 
cubits. The curvature is ornamented with muqarnas motifs, while 
from the cornice to the inner summit of the dome, which is at a height 
of 32 yards from the floor of the building, there are arranged marble 
slabs cut in a geometric molded pattern.

blended their traditions to form a new style of miniature painting. 
In addition, Central Asian, Persian, and local builders and crafts¬ 
people blended their architectural styles and techniques to create 
a new Mughal style in architecture. 

In a sense, the Mughal art of India revels in extremes—the 
largest and the smallest of Islamic miniature paintings, the largest 
but also the most finely woven small Islamic carpets, the most 
spectacular of all Islamic tomb structures, and the most extrava¬ 
gant Islamic jewelry and fanciful hardstone carving are all to be 
found here. 

BOOK ILLUSTRATION A miniature painting in opaque water- 
colors on paper of a darbar , or ceremonial audience, given by the 
Mughal emperor Jahangir (r. 1605-1627), probably completed 
around 1620 by the court artists Manohar and Abul Hasan, shows 
the characteristics of the Mughal style (fig. 9.34). The Mughals 
liked realistic pictures of current events; and almost every individ¬ 
ual in the crowd can be identified by comparison with individual 
portraits made around the same time. Along with this specificity, 
extended to the visiting black-clad European monk and even to 
the smiling elephant, is a love of opulent detail, while space is 
created in the time-honored Islamic fashion by the use of a high 
point of view and an overlapping technique. 

DECORATIVE ARTS A different side of Mughal art is seen in 
a wine cup fashioned from translucent white jade (fig. 9.35) for 
the emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1657). The delicately petaled 


blossom that forms the bowl of the cup gently tapers to the han¬ 
dle in the form of a bearded mountain goat from Kashmir. Despite 
the hardness of the stone, which had to be shaped by grinding for

hundreds of hours, the finished product has the freshness of a 
flower itself. The same attention to botanical realism can be seen 
in floral decoration in many Mughal mediums, from textiles and 
carpets to carved and inlaid marble. 

ARCHITECTURE: TAJ MAHAL The most famous of all 
Mughal works is doubtless the Taj Mahal, a royal tomb in Agra 
completed around 1650 and commissioned by Shah Jahan in 
memory of his deceased wife Mumtaz Mahal (fig. 9.36). The 
building has the ground plan of a Timurid garden kiosk or palace 
from Central Asia, while the central dome recalls that of the 
Royal Mosque of Isfahan. (See Primary Source , page 309.) The 
snowy-white marble is lavishly inlaid with colored semiprecious 
stones in the form of flowers, vines, and beautiful cursive inscrip¬ 
tions. Set at one end of an elaborate quadripartite formal garden 
with four axial pools in the Persian style, the Taj Mahal is far more 
than a royal tomb or a dynastic monument. The inscriptions 
evoke the metaphor of the gardens of Paradise that are promised 
to devout believers in the Qur’an, and the domed building is a 
self-conscious evocation of the throne of God, re-created in an 
earthly version of divine Paradise. 


CONTINUITY AND CHANGE 
IN ISLAMIC ART 

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the great traditions of 
Islamic art continued through tumultuous periods of change. 
Economic decline led to a diminution in the royal patronage that 
had produced some of the most spectacular works of earlier 
periods, but stylistic traditions in every major area of the Islamic 
world continued to live on, despite political and economic 
dislocation, European colonialism, and the increasing use of 
factory-made goods in everyday life. Art of all kinds in a huge 
variety of mediums flourishes throughout the Islamic world in 
many countries today, largely ignored even by specialists in 
Islamic art because they have been trained to look at the works of 
earlier periods. Slowly, through encounters with new mediums 
and genres, with the pervasive American-European tradition of 
the later twentieth century, and through reencounters with their 
own historical past, Muslim artists are creating new traditions that 
seek to express what almost every artistic tradition has always 
embodied in almost every time—new creativity in the context of 
a rich and meaningful past.

Early Medieval Art 


o 


T he term early medieval is something of a catchall phrase 

used to describe the art of a number of cultures and a variety of regions 
in western Europe after the Fall of Rome (476 ce) until the eleventh 
century (map 10.1). Significant in Romes demise was the power asserted 
by migrating Germanic peoples (including Franks, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and 


Saxons), who moved into and through Europe and eventually 
established permanent settlements both north of the Alps and in 
Italy, Spain, and southern France. These were clearly tumultuous 
times, as invaders clashed and eventually mixed with local inhab¬ 
itants, including the Celts, the descendants of the Iron Age 
peoples of Europe. ("Celt” is a confusing term, since it is also used 
to define tribal groups who occupied Britain and Ireland between 
the fifth and twelfth centuries.) As the invaders established per¬ 
manent settlements, they adopted many customs traditional to the 
areas they inhabited. Overlaid on this mix of customs were 
Roman traditions, including those of Christianity, which in many 
cases had been adopted by indigenous local tribes when they were 
conquered by Rome. 

The allure of Christianity—for both its spiritual message and 
for the structure it imposed on a fragmented society in times of 
turmoil—once again proved momentous. Conversion from pagan 
worship, however, was now less an individual decision (as it had 
been in the Early Christian period) than a social one. Often, when 
a tribal leader decided to convert to Christianity, his subjects con¬ 
verted with him, virtually en masse, as occurred in Reims on 
Christmas Day in 496, when 3,000 Franks were baptized along 
with Clovis, their king.

The Church emerged as a force vitally important for European 
unification; even so, loyalty to family and clan continued to gov¬ 
ern social and political alliances. Strong chiefs assumed leadership 
and established tribal allegiances and methods of exchange, both 
economic and political, that would eventually result in the devel¬ 
opment throughout western Europe of a system of political 
organization known as feudalism. These social and political align¬ 
ments eventually led to a succession of ruling dynasties governed 
by strong leaders who were able to increase the areas under their 
dominion. These dynasties (principally the Carolingian and 
Ottoman) were ambitious to reestablish a centralized authority, 
absent in Europe after the Fall of Rome. The attempt to provide a 
stable political structure was based, if not in the reality of the 
Roman Empire, then at least in the ideals embodied in its legacy. 

The art that resulted from this cultural interchange is a vibrant 
and vital mix. Artistic methods, materials, and traditions, intro¬ 
duced by migration, were combined with those that predomi¬ 
nated in the regions where tribes settled. Much of this art is 
marked by elaborate patterns of interlocking and interwoven 
designs that decorate sumptuous objects of personal adornment, 
reflecting their owners’ social position. Eventually the Church 
assumed increasing importance in commissioning works of art, 
and there was a shift of emphasis in the types of objects produced. 
The Church built and decorated many houses of worship and 
established a large number of monastic communities. Within the 
monasteries, scriptoria made elaborately decorated books, which

were sent off with missionaries as aids in their efforts to convert 
and educate. 

Carolingian and Ottoman artists expressed the imperial ambi¬ 
tions of their leaders by building churches and designing architec¬ 
tural complexes that consciously emulated Rome. Roman-derived 
Early Christian basilicas served as models for a large number of 
buildings north of the Alps. Court-related artists also produced 
copies of ancient books. And three-dimensional sculpture, an art 
form virtually abandoned after the Fall of Rome, once again 
attracted the attention of artists and their patrons. Thus, out of an 
amalgam of diverse and conflicting forces, and as new social and 
cultural entities developed, an art emerged that is as varied as it 
is exciting. 

ANGLO-SAXON ART 

The widespread migrations of peoples transformed Europe. In 
376, the Huns, who had advanced beyond the Black Sea from 
Central Asia, became a serious threat to Europe. They pushed the 


Germanic Visigoths westward into the Roman Empire from the 
Danube. Then in 451, under Attila (d. 453), they invaded Gaul, 
present-day France and Germany, and its resident Celts. Also in 
the fifth century, the Angles and Saxons from today s Denmark 
and northern Germany invaded the British Isles, which had been 
colonized for centuries by Celts. Many of these Germanic tribes 
developed into virtual kingdoms: the Visigoths in Spain, the 
Burgundians and Franks in Gaul, the Ostrogoths and Lombards 
in Italy The Vikings controlled Scandinavia and ventured afar, a 
result of their might as sailors. 

The Germanic peoples brought with them art forms that were 
portable: weaving, metalwork, jewelry and woodcarvings. 
Artistic production in these mediums required training and skill 
of execution, and metalwork in particular had intrinsic value, 
since it was often made of gold or silver and inlaid with precious 
stones. Metalworkers had high social status, a measure of the 
respect accorded to their labor and to the value of the objects they 
produced. (See Materials and Techniques , page 315.) In some 
Germanic folk legends, metalworkers have abilities so remarkable 
that they are described as magical. Numerous small-scale objects 


314 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 





















M etal was a precious commodity in the Middle Ages. Even in the 
ancient world, patterns of interchange and colonization can be 
related to exploration for desirable metals: For example, the Greek 
settlements in Italy and Roman settlements in Spain were a result of a 
desire for metals. Popular metals employed in the early Middle Ages 
included gold, silver, copper, iron, and bronze. The many ways that 
metals could be worked was undoubtedly one of their most compelling 
features. They could be flattened, drawn thin, or made into an open¬ 
work design of filigree, lacy decoration made from intertwined wires. 
They could also be cast, engraved, punched, stamped, and decorated 
with colored stones, glass, or enamels. 

The large gold buckle from the Sutton Hoo ship burial (see fig. 1 0.1) 
contains nearly a pound of gold, although it is only one of many gold 
pieces found in the burial site. That so much early medieval metalwork 
from grave sites is gold reflects the value attached to the metal. In 
addition, gold is not harmed by contact with either earth or water 
(whereas silver and other metals are subject to progressive destruction 
when exposed to the elements). Although gold had been obtained in 
Europe through mining since Roman times, the most common method 
of acquiring it was by collecting nuggets or small grains from rivers 
and streams (called placer or alluvial gold). The Rhine, Tiber, Po, 
Rhone, and Garonne rivers, along which the Germanic tribes settled, 
were major sources of this type of gold, which medieval writers refer 
to as “sand” gold. 

Sutton Hoo’s gold buckle is decorated with granulation, beads of 
gold bonded to the surface, as well as inlaid niello, the dark material 
that is set into incisions in the metal surface and that sets off the intri¬ 
cate interlace designs composed of lines and dots. Niello is a sulfur 
alloy of silver, copper, or lead that, when heated, fuses with the metal 
that surrounds it, in this case gold, and produces a nearly black sub¬ 
stance. The shiny dark niello serves to emphasize the brilliance of the 
gold and to accentuate the details of the intricate patterns. 

A medieval treatise written by a monk named Theophilus in 
Germany in the early twelfth century contains instructions for polish¬ 
ing inlaid niello. First, smooth the niello with a soft stone dampened 
with saliva; then, using a piece of limewood, rub it with a powder of 
ground soft stone and saliva. After that, as Theophilus explains: 

For a very long time, lightly rub the niello with this piece of wood 
and the powder, continually adding spittle so that it remains 
moist, until it becomes bright all over. Then take some wax from 
the hollow of your ear, and, when you have wiped the niello dry 
with a fine linen cloth, you smear this all over it and rub lightly 
with a goatskin or deerskin until it becomes completely bright.

cells that enclose glass or gems. For the Sutton Hoo jewelry, red gar¬ 
nets are used extensively. In fact, the Sutton Hoo jewelry includes 
more than 4,000 individual garnets. Colored glass, often arranged in 
checkered patterns, is also used in these pieces; on the main field of 
the hinged clasps, cloisons enclose colored glass to form a step pat¬ 
tern, which enhances the overall decorative effect. 

Many of the decorative devices and materials employed in Anglo- 
Saxon metalwork were later used by Irish metalworkers. A spectacular 
example is the Tara Brooch, an accidental find made by a child play¬ 
ing by the seashore in County Meath, Ireland, in 1 850. The brooch is 
a kind of stickpin used to join two pieces of a garment together. An 
incredible amount of decoration—including spirals, bird, animal, and 
human heads, and interlace patterns—is compressed on a piece of 
jewelry of just over 3 V inches in diameter. Panels of gold filigree, con¬ 
sisting of fine soldered wire, are combined on the back of the brooch 
with silver plaques with inlaid spiral designs in copper. A braided wire 
attachment was possibly a safety chain.

reflect the vitality of artistic forms produced by these migrating 
peoples, demonstrating an aesthetic that is quite different from 
the tradition that derives from Greece and Rome, yet equally rich 
in myth and imagery 

The Animal Style 

The artistic tradition of the Germanic peoples, referred to by some 
scholars as the animal style because of its heavy use of stylized 
animal-like forms, merged with the intricate ornamental metal¬ 
work of the Celts, producing a unique combination of abstract 
and organic shapes, of formal discipline and imaginative freedom. 

SHIP BURIAL, SUTTON HOO, ENGLAND An Anglo- 
Saxon ship burial in England follows the age-old tradition of 
burying important people with their personal effects. This custom 
may reflect a concern for the afterlife or it may simply be a way 
to honor the dead, but undoubtedly a correlation was understood 
between a sea voyage and the journey to an eternal resting place. 
The ship burial at Sutton Hoo (hoo is Anglo-Saxon for “head¬ 
land” or “promontory”), discovered in 1939 in one of 18 burial 
mounds on the site, is of a seventh-century Anglian king (gener¬ 
ally thought to be King Raedwald, who died around 625). The 
ship, one of two buried on the site, was over 90 feet long and 14 
feet in the beam and was hauled more than a third of a mile from 
the sea. Military gear, silver and enamelware, official royal regalia, 
gold coins, and objects of personal adornment are all part of the 
entombment. Since no trace of a body was originally found in the 
ship, some claimed that the burial was a cenotaph, a memorial 
monument to honor a person buried elsewhere; it was also argued 
that the highly acidic soil could have destroyed any evidence of 
human remains. More recent analysis suggests that the presence of 
phosphate residuals, particularly along the keel of the ship, could 
indicate biological remains. Even if that claim is correct, it would 
not necessarily prove that those remains were human, since ani¬ 
mals were buried in other mounds at Sutton Hoo; the practice of 


burying items that were part of a funeral feast could also produce 
phosphatic residue. 

The Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, so concerned with displays 
of royal responsibility and obligation, includes a description of a 
ship fitted out for a funeral that is reminiscent of the Sutton Hoo 
burial. The funeral is that of Beowulf’s father, King Scyld: 

A ring-whorled prow rode in the harbour, 
ice-clad, outbound, a craft for a prince. 

They stretched their beloved lord in his boat, 
laid out by the mast, amidships, 
the great ring-giver. Far-fetched treasures 
were piled upon him, and precious gear. 

I never heard before of a ship so well furbished 
with battle tackle, bladed weapons 
and coats of mail. The massed treasure 
was loaded on top of him: it would travel far 
on out into the ocean s sway. 

Translated by Seamus Heaney, Beowulf. A New Verse Translation 
(NY: Farrar, Straus, & Giroux, 2000) 

Although Beowulf describes events that predate the Sutton Hoo 
find by at least a century, the poem was probably not composed 
until a century or more after that burial. So, while Beowulf should 
not be taken as a documentary account, it does suggest a royal 
context for the Sutton Hoo site. 

Intricate animal-style design covers a large gold buckle from 
Sutton Hoo (fig. 10.1). Two interlaced biting snakes decorate the 
stud to which the tongue of the buckle is attached. That stud is in 
turn affixed to a plaque with intertwined serpents and eagle heads 
covering virtually every available space. It has been traditional for 
scholars to refer to the need to decorate all surfaces as an expres¬ 
sion of horror vacui , a fear of empty space. But this designation 
imposes our contemporary values on a culture alien to them. Unlike 
the Greeks and Romans, who used spatial illusionism to animate 
their art, Germanic and Celtic artists used intricate patterns to

enliven the surface of their precious objects. Although the designs 
can seem confusing and claustrophobic to us, there is a consistent 
and intentional tightness in the way the patterns hold together. 

A pair of hinged clasps (fig. 10.2) from the burial also contains 
intertwined serpents, here functioning as framing devices for a 
diagonally oriented checkerboard field of garnets and glass set in 
gold. At the end of each clasp is a curved plaque on which crouch 
boars back to back. So tightly integrated into the design are these 
animals that it is difficult to decide if the plaque curves to allow 
for the representation of the boars or if the animals’ backs hunch 
in response to the shape of the clasp. 


A gold, enamel, and garnet purse cover (fig. 10.3) was also 
found at Sutton Hoo. The three hinges at the top of the purse 
attached to leather straps suspended from the belt that was held 
together by the gold buckle illustrated in fig. 10.1. The purse itself 
was probably a leather pouch, the whole arrangement reminiscent 
of the sporran that Scots wear in front of their kilts. Its original 
ivory or bone background does not survive and has been replaced. 
Each of four pairs of symmetrical motifs has its own distinctive 
character, an indication that they were assembled from different 
sources. One, the standing man between facing animals in the 
lower row, has a very long history indeed. We first saw him in

Mesopotamian art more than 3,200 years earlier (see fig. 2.9). The 
upper design, at the center, is of more recent origin. It consists of 
fighting animals whose tails, legs, and jaws are elongated into 
bands that form a complex interweaving pattern. The fourth 
design, on the top left and right, uses interlacing bands as an orna¬ 
mental device. The combination of these bands with the animal 
style, as shown here, seems to have been invented not long before 
our purse cover was made. 

The Sutton Hoo objects are significant for the way they 
illustrate the transmission of motifs and techniques through the 
migration of various peoples. They show evidence of cultural 
interchange with Germanic peoples, combined with evidence of 
Scandinavian roots, but there are other noteworthy connections 
as well. King Raedwald was reputed to have made offerings to 
Christ, as well as to his ancestral pagan gods. A number of the 
objects discovered at Sutton Hoo make specific reference to 
Christianity, including silver bowls decorated with a cross, 
undoubtedly the result of trade with the Mediterranean. There is 
also a set of spoons inscribed with the names of Saul and Paul, 
perhaps a reference to Christian conversion (Saul changed his 
name to Paul on his conversion). Is it too much to wonder, as 
some scholars have done, if the crosses inscribed in the glass 
checkerboards on the Sutton Hoo clasps (see fig. 10.2) are a 
conscious reference to the new religion? These clasps were sewn 
onto two parts of a garment, probably held together at the 
shoulders, as is suggested by their curvature. Although executed 
in the patterns of Anglo-Saxon style, they take the form of 
fasteners very like those seen in Roman gear; for example, the 
shoulder attachments of the breastplate of the Augustus of 
Primaporta (see fig. 7.29). In fact, Roman and Byzantine articles 
accompany other objects of local manufacture that copy imperial 
forms in the Sutton Hoo graves. This has been cited as evidence 
that the chieftain buried or commemorated there consciously 
presented himself as a Roman ruler. 

The chief medium of the animal style was clearly metalwork. 
Such articles, small, durable, and often of exquisitely refined 
craftsmanship, were eagerly sought after, which accounts for the 
rapid diffusion of the animal-style repertoire of forms. These 
forms spread not only geographically but also from one material 
to another, migrating from metal into wood, stone, and even 
paint. They were used to convey a variety of messages, some 
clearly pagan and others Christian. 

HIBERNO-SAXON ART 

During the early Middle Ages, the Irish (called Hibernians after 
the Roman name for Ireland, Hibernia) came to be the spiritual 
and cultural leaders of western Europe. Since the Irish had never 
been part of the Roman Empire, the missionaries who carried 
Christianity to them from England in the fifth century found a 
Celtic society that was barbarian by Roman standards. The Irish 
readily accepted Christianity, bringing them into contact with 
Mediterranean civilization. However, because the institutional 


framework of the Roman Church was essentially urban, it did not 
suit the rural Irish way of life. Irish Christians preferred to follow 
the example of the desert saints of Egypt and the Near East, who 
had sought spiritual perfection in the solitude of the wilderness, 
where groups of them founded the earliest monasteries (see page 
263). Thus, Irish monasteries were established in isolated, 
secluded areas, even on islands off the mainland, and such places 
required complete self-sufficiency. 

Manuscripts 

Irish monasteries soon became centers of learning and the arts, 
with much energy spent copying literary and religious texts. They 
also sent monks abroad to preach to nonbelievers and to found 
monasteries in northern Britain and Europe, from present-day 
France to Austria. Each monastery’s scriptorium became an artis¬ 
tic center. Although pictures illustrating biblical events held little

318 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 



interest for the Irish monks, they devoted great efforts to deco¬ 
rative embellishment. The finest of these manuscripts belong to 
the Hiberno-Saxon style—a style that combines Christian with 
Celtic and Germanic elements, and that flourished in the monas¬ 
teries of Ireland as well as those founded by Irish monks in Saxon 
England. These Irish monks helped speed the conversion to 
Christianity in Europe north of the Alps. Throughout Europe, 
they made the monastery a cultural center and thus influenced 
medieval civilization for several hundred years. 

In order to spread the message concerning Christ, the 
Kingdom of God, and salvation—called the Gospel—the Irish 
monasteries had to produce large numbers of copies of the Bible 
and other Christian books by hand. Every manuscript copy was 
looked upon as a sacred object containing the Word of God, and 
its beauty needed to reflect the importance of its contents. Each 
of the four books of the Gospel, which were credited to the evan¬ 
gelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, was prefaced by a repre¬ 
sentation of the books author or an animal that functioned as his 
symbol. These symbols were assigned to the evangelists by early 
commentators, including St. Jerome (342-420), who was respon¬ 
sible for the first translation of the Bible into Latin. Although the 
tradition of assigning specific symbols was at first far from codi¬ 
fied, eventually the symbols came to be systematically associated 
with the evangelists as follows: the man or angel with St. 
Matthew, the lion with St. Mark, the ox with St. Luke, and the 
eagle with St. John. These beasts were described in the Book of 
Ezekiel (1:5-14) in the Hebrew Bible and in the Apocalypse of 
St. John the Evangelist (4:6-8) in the Christian one. 

The illustration of the symbol of St. Matthew in the Book of 
Durrow (fig. 10.4) shows how ornamental pattern can animate a 
figure even while accentuating its surface decoration. The body 
of the figure, composed of framed sections of a checkerboard 
pattern, recalls the ornamental quality of the Sutton Hoo clasps 
(see fig. 10.2). The addition of a head, which confronts us 
directly, and feet, turned to the side, transform the decorative 
motifs into a human figure. Active, elaborate patterns, previously 
seen in metalwork, are here employed to demonstrate that St. 
Matthews message is precious. Irish scribes and artists were 
revered for their abilities and achievements. A medieval account 
relates how, after his death, an Irish scribe s hands were preserved 
as relics capable of performing miracles. 

THE LINDISFARNE GOSPELS Thanks to a later colophon 
(a note at the end of a manuscript), we know a great deal about the 
origin of the Lindisfarne Gospels , produced in Northumbria, 
England, including the name of the translator (Aldred) and of the 
scribe (Bishop Eadfrith), who presumably painted the illumina¬ 
tions as well. (See Brimary Source , page 320.) Given the high 
regard in which Irish scribes and artists were held, it is not sur¬ 
prising that a bishop is credited with writing and decorating this 
manuscript. In Irish monasteries monks were divided into three 
categories: juniors (pupils and novice monks), working brothers 
(engaged in manual labor), and seniors (the most experienced 
monks, who were responsible for copying sacred books).

The British Library, London 

The Cross page (fig. 10.5 and see page 312) is a creation of 
breathtaking complexity. Working with the precision of a jeweler, 
the miniaturist (the illuminator of the manuscript) poured into 
the geometric frame animal interlace so dense and yet so full of 
movement that the fighting beasts on the Sutton Hoo purse cover 
(see fig. 10.3) seem simple in comparison. In order to achieve this 
effect, the artist had to work within a severe discipline as though 
he were following specific rules. The smallest motifs and the 
largest patterns were worked out in advance of painting. Ruler 
and compass were used to mark the page with a network of grid 
lines and with points, both drawn and pricked. In applying paint, 
the artist followed his drawing exactly. No mark is allowed to 
interfere with either the rigid balance of individual features or the 
overall design. The scholar Frangoise Henry has suggested that 
artists conceived of their work as “a sort of sacred riddle” com¬ 
posed of abstract forms to be sorted out and deciphered. Organic

Lindisfarne Gospels 



Colophon 

Colophons are notes written at the end of some manuscripts recording 
who wrote them, when, for whom, e£c. The colophon at the end of the 
Lindisfarne Gospels (ca. 700 ce) was written some 250 years afier the 
text, hut most scholars believe that its in formation is accurate. It names 
the scribe, the hinder , the maker of the metal ornaments on the binding , 
and the author of the English translation of the Latin text, hut no 
painter. The painting seems to have been done by E ad frith, the scribe. 


E adfrith, Bishop of the Lindisfarne Church, originally wrote this 
book, for God and for Saint Cuthbert and ... for all the saints 
whose relics are in the Island. And Ethelwald, Bishop of the 
Lindisfarne islanders, impressed it on the outside and covered it—as 
he well knew how to do. And Billfrith, the anchorite, forged the 
ornaments which are on it on the outside and adorned it with gold 
and with gems and also with gilded-over silver—pure metal. And 
Aldred, unworthy and most miserable priest, glossed it in English 
between the lines with the help of God and Saint Cuthbert.

and geometric shapes had to be kept separate. Within the animal 
compartments, every line had to turn out to be part of an animal s 
body. Other rules concerned symmetry, mirror-image effects, and 
repetitions of shapes and colors. Only by intense observation can 
we enter into the spirit of this mazelike world. It is as if these bit¬ 
ing and clawing monsters are subdued by the power of the Cross,

converted to Christian purpose just as were the Celtic tribes 
themselves. 

Several factors came together to foster the development of the 
Hiberno-Saxon style: the isolation of the Irish, the sophistication 
of their scriptoria in the secluded monastic environments, and the 
zealous desire to spread the word of Christianity. In time and 
with more contact with the Continent—Rome in particular— 
Hiberno-Saxon art reflected new influences. The illustration of 
Matthew in the Lindisfarne Gospels (fig. 10.6) is striking by com¬ 
parison with the Matthew from the Book ofDurrow (see fig. 10.4), 
made only a generation or two earlier. In the Lindisfarne Gospels , 
Matthew studies his text intently, and the artist suggests a sense of 
space by turning the figure and the bench on an angle to indicate 
depth, whereas in the Book of Durrow , the saint stares out 
frontally at the reader with his hands at his sides. There are no 
other figures in the Book ofDurrow image, whereas the tied-back 
curtain in the Lindisfarne manuscript reveals an unidentified 
figure, whom some identify as Christ holding the Christian Bible 
and others, more convincingly, as Moses holding the Hebrew 
Bible. The latter identification is more compelling because the 
contrast between the open book of the Gospel writer and the 
closed book of the other figure correlates with distinctions 
between the two Testaments that were often made in the Middle 
Ages. Also, whereas Matthew in the Book of Durrow wears a 
costume of flat patterns, the Lindisfarne Matthew wears clothes 
marked by folds; a dark undergarment is distinguished from a 
lighter toga, suggesting a pliant material that responds to the body 
beneath it. 

How do we explain this change? We know that in the seventh 
and eighth centuries the Irish had increased contact with Rome 
and came to adopt Roman liturgical practices. For example, the 
abbot of the monastery of Jarrow, near Lindisfarne, is reported 
to have returned from Rome at the end of the seventh century 
with a host of manuscripts. Artists at Jarrow probably used the 
illuminations in these manuscripts as models. The illustration of 
the prophet Ezra restoring the Bible from the Codex Amiatinus 
(fig. 10.7), produced at Jarrow, is undoubtedly an adaptation 
of Roman illuminations available at the monastery. The artist 
depicts the book cupboard (reminiscent of the one in the St. 
Lawrence lunette from Galla Placidia [see fig. 8.14]), table, bench,

and footstool by using oblique angles, which convey a sense of 
perspective, as if the objects recede into depth. Likewise, the 
shading in the drapery and the shadow of the inkwell on the floor 
promote a sense of depth. The artist also used color blending 
(evident on Ezra s garments and on his hands, face, and feet) to 
model form. Notice, in particular, how Ezra s cushion seems to 
have been depressed by the weight of his body, lending further 
substance to the prophet s figure. 

Some have suggested that Eadfrith, the illustrator of the 
Lindisfarne Matthew (see fig. 10.6), referred to the same Roman 
manuscript that inspired the Ezra artist, who produced a more 
faithful interpretation of it. Indeed, identical poses and parallel 
features such as the bench are too conspicuous to be ignored. 
However, Eadfrith was eager, or perhaps felt required, to maintain 
some Hiberno-Saxon traditional devices: Unlike the Ezra artist, 
he decorated the bench with multiple patterns, and suggested 
depth in the drapery by juxtaposing near-complementary colors, 


playing off the reddish folds against the greenish cloth. Eadfrith 
employed the same rigid outline, geometric decoration, and flat 
planes of color that he used for the manuscript s nonfigural pages 
(see fig. 10.5). Much as the Ezra page allows us to appreciate what 
antique manuscripts that no longer survive might have looked 
like, the Lindisfarne page is both more striking and more dra¬ 
matic. As the Lindisfarne Gospels document a process of synthe¬ 
sis between northern and Mediterranean elements, it helps us 
appreciate the remarkable contribution to European art made by 
migration styles and the skill of Hiberno-Saxon artists. 

THE BOOK OF KELLS The Hiberno-Saxon manuscript style 
reached its climax a hundred years after the Lindisfarne Gospels in 
the Book of Kells, the most elaborate codex of Celtic art. It was 
probably made, or at least begun, at the end of the eighth or the 
beginning of the ninth century at the monastery on the island of 
Iona, off the western coast of Scotland, which had been founded 
by Irish monks in the sixth century The books name derives 
from the Irish monastery of Kells, where the manuscript was 
housed from the late ninth century until the seventeenth century 
Its many pages reflect a wide array of influences from the 
Mediterranean to the English Channel. 

The Chi Rho Iota monogram page illustrates Christ s initials, 
XPI, in Greek (fig. 10.8). Alongside them appear the words 
Ghristi autem generatio , or “now this is how the birth of Christ 
came about,” heralding the beginning of the Book of Matthew 
(1:18), in which the birth of Jesus is celebrated. The Chi Rho Iota 
page has much the same swirling design as the Cross page from 
the Lindisfarne Gospels , and a viewer can also see parallels to 
contemporary jewelry such as the Tara Brooch (see Materials and 
Techniques , page 315). The relationship between manuscript 
illumination and precious metalwork is far from accidental, 
evidenced by the display of both on altars and their being housed 
in church treasuries. During a period when literacy was rare and 
class-based, the book was a symbol of authority and dominance, 
an object that must have mystified many people as much as it 
elucidated matters for others. 

On the Chi Rho Iota page, the rigid geometry of the 
Lindisfarne Cross page and the Tara Brooch has been relaxed 
somewhat, and for the first time images of humans are incorpo¬ 
rated into the design. The very top of the X-shaped Chi sprouts a 
recognizable face, while along its shaft are three angels with 
wings. And in a touch of enchanting fantasy the tendril-like 
P-shaped Rho ends in a human head that has been hypothesized 
to be a representation of Christ. More surprising still is the intro¬ 
duction of the natural world. Nearly hidden in the ornamenta¬ 
tion, as if playing a game of hide-and-seek, are cats and mice, but¬ 
terflies, even otters catching fish. No doubt they performed a 
symbolic function for medieval readers, even if the meaning is no 
longer apparent to us. The richness and intricacy of the illustra¬ 
tion compels concentration, establishing a direct connection 
between the viewer and the image in much the same way as does 
the fixed, direct gaze of the holy figure in an Early Byzantine icon 
(see fig. 8.35). In each work, icon and manuscript illumination,

the power of the image is so strong that the viewer virtually enters 
into its realm, forgetting the world outside its frame. 

VIKING ART 

It was not only in Hiberno-Saxon art that the animal style showed 
its power to adapt to a variety of materials and forms of expres¬ 
sion. The inhabitants of Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, and 
Denmark) had lived out of the Roman orbit, although they shared 
many beliefs and practices with their Germanic brethren and 
neighbors. In fact, the animal style flourished in Scandinavia long 
beyond the Germanic-Nordic migrations in the region, longer 
than it did anywhere else. These northern people are often labeled 
Vikings, though the term is a misleading one, since it derives 
from the Old Norse V inkin gr, which means sea pirate or raider; 
thus, these people were really only “Vikings” when they went 
“a-viking” out of their own coastal waters, to England or Russia, 
for instance. By the eighth century Nordic sailors increasingly 
wandered around the shores of Europe, both trading with and 


attacking the local populations. This sometimes led to permanent 
settlements, such as occurred in Iceland in the ninth century and 
Greenland in the tenth, and when a colony was established in 
northwestern France. Even today the French region is called 
Normandy and its inhabitants are referred to as Normans in 
recognition of its settlement by Norsemen (or “North Men”). 

SHIP BURIAL, OSEBERG, NORWAY It is in Scandinavia that 
the origins for burying important people in ships, such as at 
Sutton Hoo, can be found; this is also where the practice seems to 
have continued longer than elsewhere. A buried Viking ship of the 
early ninth century found at Oseberg, in southern Norway is 
more than 75 feet long; the boat was not a raiding vessel, but 
rather a pleasure craft, used for sailing in calm waters (fig. 10.9). 
Two women, placed on beds in a burial chamber, were interred 
within the ship, which also included oars, a ramp, an elaborately 
carved cart, sleds, and the skeletons of at least ten horses. Grave 
robbers stole whatever jewelry and metalwork, which is pre¬ 
sumed to have been significant, that accompanied the deceased in 
the buried vessel.

The prow and stern of the ship end in wavelike spirals, and the 
prow terminates in a serpents head. If we recall the passage in 
Beowulf c ited above (see page 316), we realize that the “ring- 
whorled prow” of the poem undoubtedly describes the spiral 
ornament of a boat such as the one from Oseberg. The body of 
the ship is framed at bow and stern by bands of carved reliefs in 
which biting and clawing animals are intertwined in an intricate 
and strangely orderly procession. Five wooden posts decorated 
with snarling monsters looking like mythical sea dragons were 
found in the buried ship. Their actual function is not known, 
although suggestions include the possibility that they were car¬ 
ried in processions or used for cult functions. The head on one of 
the posts (fig. 10.10) displays all the characteristics of the animal 
style and is surprisingly realistic, as are such details as the teeth, 
gums, and nostrils. Interlacing and geometric patterns cover the 
head, with deep undercutting and rounded forms accentuating 
these surface designs. Although the origins of the patterns 
employed here are found within Germanic and Anglo-Saxon 
motifs, they have been forcefully adapted to fit the animal head s 
dynamic curving forms. Scientific studies using dendrochronology

(the analysis of the growth rings of trees or wooden objects) date 
the Oseberg ship burial to 834. One of the women buried at 
Oseberg is often identified as Queen Asa, wife of Gudrod the 
Magnificent (ca. 780-820), because it is assumed that only a royal 
personage would have had the resources to commission objects of 
such richness, but recent scholarship questions the royal nature of 
the burial. 

CAROLINGIAN ART 

During the late eighth century, a new empire developed out of the 
collection of tribes and kingdoms that dominated northern conti¬ 
nental Europe. This empire, which united most of Europe from 
the North Sea to Spain and as far south as Lombardy in northern 
Italy, was founded by Charlemagne, who ruled as king of the 
Franks from 768 to 814. Pope Leo III bestowed on him the title 
of emperor of Rome in Old St. Peter s basilica on Christmas Day 
in the year 800, pronouncing him successor to Constantine, the 
first Christian emperor. Although Charlemagne was able to resist 
the pope s attempts to assert his authority over the newly created 
Catholic Empire, there was now an interdependence of spiritual 
and political authority, of Church and State, that would define the 
history of western Europe for many centuries. 

The emperors were crowned in Rome, but they did not live 
there. Charlemagne built his capital at the center of his power, in 
Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), located in what is now Germany and 
close to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The period domi¬ 
nated by Charlemagne and his successors, roughly from 768 to 
877, is labeled Carolingian (derived from Charlemagne s Latin 
name, Carolus Magnus , meaning “Charles the Great”). Among 
Charlemagne s goals were to better the administration of his 
realm and the teaching of Christian truths. He summoned the best 
minds to his court, including Alcuin of York, the most learned 
scholar of the day, to restore ancient Roman learning and to estab¬ 
lish a system of schools at every cathedral and monastery. The 
emperor took an active hand in this renewal, which went well 
beyond a mere interest in old books to include political objec¬ 
tives. He modeled his rule after the Roman Empire under 
Constantine and Justinian—rather than their pagan predeces¬ 
sors—and proclaimed a renovatio imperii romani , a “renewal of 
imperial Rome,” his efforts being aided by the pope who had 
crowned him Holy Roman Emperor. The artists working for 
Charlemagne and other Carolingian rulers consciously sought to 
emulate Rome; by combining their admiration for antiquity with 
native northern European features, they produced original works 
of art of the highest quality. 

Sculpture 

A bronze Equestrian Statue of a Carolingian Ruler (fig. 10.11), 
once thought to be of Charlemagne himself but now generally 
said to be of his grandson Charles the Bald, conveys the political 
objectives of the Carolingian dynasty. The ruler, wearing imperial

robes, sits as triumphantly on his steed as if he were on a throne. 
In his hand is an orb signifying his domination of the world. The 
statue is probably modeled on a now lost antique Roman eques¬ 
trian statue of Theodoric, which Charlemagne had brought from 
Ravenna for the courtyard of his imperial palace. There are other 
possible sources, including a bronze equestrian statue of Marcus 
Aurelius (see fig. 7.33), once mistakenly thought to represent 
Constantine, the first Christian emperor, and thus also an appro¬ 
priate model for the ambitious Charlemagne and his successors. 

The Carolingian statue is not a slavish copy of its antique 
model. It is simpler and less cluttered with detail than the statue 
of Marcus Aurelius for instance. What is important is that it com¬ 
municates the significant message that the Carolingian rulers were 
heirs to the Roman imperial throne. What is most striking is the 
difference in size: Marcus Aurelius stands more than 11 feet high, 


324 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 





while the Carolingian figure does not reach 10 inches. Yet the 
diminutive statue expresses as much majesty and dignity as the 
more monumental example. Given the metalwork tradition of the 
Franks, the miniaturization is not only appropriate, but might in 
itself suggest value. Unfortunately, we do not know the audience 
for the work or how it was used, though its smallness could relate 
to portability. 

Illuminated Books 

Charlemagne’s interest in promoting learning and culture 
required the production of large numbers of books by his scrip¬ 
toria. He established an “academy” at his court and encouraged 
the collecting and copying of many works of ancient Roman lit¬ 
erature. In fact, the oldest surviving texts of many classical Latin 
authors are found in Carolingian manuscripts that were long 
considered of Roman origin. This very page is printed in letters

the shapes of which derive from the script in Carolingian 
manuscripts. The fact that these letters are known today as 
“Roman” rather than Carolingian is a result of the confusion 
about the manuscripts’ origins. 

THE CODESCALC GOSPELS One of the earliest manuscripts 
created in Charlemagne’s scriptoria is the Godescalc Gospels , named 
after the monk who signed his name to the book; it is generally 
thought to reflect manuscripts and objects that Charlemagne 
brought back with him from Rome. The manuscript’s most com¬ 
pelling image is of a monumental Enthroned Christ (fig. 10.12), 
whose large staring eyes communicate directly with the viewer. 
His purple garments denote imperial stature. (Purple was the 
color of royalty in the Roman world.) The concentration on 
imperial imagery reflects Charlemagne’s personal ambitions, 
which were to be realized about 20 years later, when he received 
the title of Holy Roman Emperor in 800. Hard lines and swirling 
patterns around the knees suggest where drapery falls over the 
body, and white lines on the hands, neck, and face indicate high¬ 
lights. It is as if the artist is attempting to emulate Roman model¬ 
ing, but does so in a Northern manner, by using linear patterns. 

Christ sits within an enclosed garden, a motif reminiscent of 
Roman painting (see fig. 7.55), but transformed here into flat 
decorative elements, almost like the designs on a carpet. The out¬ 
lined letters of Christ’s name and the frame, composed of interlace 
patterns, are reminiscent of metalwork (see figs. 10.1-10.3) and 
Hiberno-Saxon illuminations (see figs. 10.4-10.6). A great painter 
has fused the heritage of Rome with the decorative devices tradi¬ 
tionally employed by northern European artists. 

This manuscript includes a dedicatory poem commemorating 
the baptism of Charlemagne’s sons by Pope Hadrian in Rome in 
781. By bringing his sons to Rome to be baptized, Charlemagne 
effectively acknowledged the authority of the pope in ecclesiasti¬ 
cal matters, although this was often disputed by later rulers. In 
turn, the pope placed himself and all of Western Christianity 
under the protection of the emperor. 

THE GOSPEL BOOK OF CHARLEMAGNE The Gospel Book 
of Charlemagne (also known as the Coronation Gospels because 
later German emperors swore on this book during their corona¬ 
tions) is said to have been found in Charlemagne’s tomb and is 
thought to have been produced at his court. Looking at the page 
with St. Matthew (fig. 10.13), we can hardly believe that such a 
work could have been executed in northern Europe and less than 
a generation after the Godescalc Gospels. Were it not for the large 
golden halo, the evangelist might almost be mistaken for a Roman 
portrait in the naturalness and solidity with which he inhabits the 
landscape setting. The artist shows himself fully conversant with 
the Roman tradition of painting, from the modeling of the forms, 
the shading of face, hands, and feet, and the body-revealing drap¬ 
ery, to the acanthus ornament on the wide frame, which makes the 
picture seem like a window. Since the manner of painting is so 
clearly Mediterranean, some claim that the artist must have come 
from Byzantium or Italy.

THE GOSPEL BOOK OF ARCHBISHOP EBBO OF REIMS 

Less reflective of classical models, but equally reliant on them, is 
a miniature painted some three decades later for the Gospel Book 
ofArchbishop Ebb o of Reims (fig. 10.14). The subject is once again 
St. Matthew, and the pose is similar to that in the Gospel Book of 
Charlemagne , but this picture is filled with a vibrant energy that 
sets everything in motion. The thickly painted drapery swirls 
about the figure, the hills heave upward, and the architecture and 
vegetation seem tossed about by a whirlwind. Even the acanthus 
pattern on the frame assumes a strange, flamelike character. The 
evangelist has been transformed from a Roman author setting 
down his thoughts into a man seized with the frenzy of divine 
inspiration, a vehicle for recording the Word of God. The way the 
artist communicates this energy, particularly through the expres¬ 
sive use of flickering line, employing his brush as if it were a pen, 
recalls the endless interlaced movement in the ornamentation of 
Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts (see figs. 10.5 and 10.8). 

THE UTRECHT PSALTER The imperial scriptorium at Reims 
responsible for the Ebbo Gospels also produced perhaps the most 
extraordinary of all Carolingian manuscripts, the Utrecht Psalter 
(fig. 10.15), where energetic form is expressed with remarkable 
pen drawings. That the artist has followed a much older model 
is indicated by the architectural and landscape settings of the 


scenes, which recall the Column of Trajan (see fig. 7.40). Another 
indication is the use of Roman capital lettering, which had gone 
out of general use several centuries before. The rhythmic quality 
of the draftsmanship, however, gives these sketches an expressive 
unity that could not have been present in earlier pictures. Without 
this rhythmic quality, the drawings of the Utrecht Psalter would 
carry little conviction, for the poetic language of the Psalms does 
not lend itself to illustration in the same way as the narrative 
portions of the Bible. Perhaps, as some scholars have suggested, 
we can attribute the drawn rather than painted style to the 
influence of an antique scroll (see fig. 8.38 and page 266) that no 
longer survives. 

The artist represented the Psalms by taking each phrase liter¬ 
ally and then visualizing it in some way Thus, the top of our page 
illustrates, “Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy 
tabernacles” (Psalms 43:3). Toward the bottom of the page, we see 
the Lord reclining on a bed, flanked by pleading angels. The 
image is based on the words “Awake, why sleepest thou, Oh 
Lord? ” (Psalms 44:23). On the left, the faithful crouch before the 
Temple (“for ... our belly cleaveth unto the earth” [Psalms 44:25]), 
and at the city gate in the foreground they are killed (“as sheep for 
the slaughter” [Psalms 44:22]). In the hands of a less imaginative

artist, this procedure could well have turned into a tiresome game; 
instead, it has the force of great drama. The wonderfully rhythmic 
and energetic quality of the draftsmanship renders these sketches 
both coherent and affecting. 

The literal approach to illustrating the Psalms in the Utrecht 
Psalter has a conceptual parallel in the lucidity with which the 
letters and words are delineated. This is a manuscript designed to 
be read; indeed, one needs to do so in order to be able to interpret 
the scenes represented. This is very different from our experience 
with Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts such as the Book of Kells (see 
fig. 10.8). There, letters and words seem to mystify, rather than 
clarify; it is as if the power of the word is unrelated to its legibil¬ 
ity. Comparison of the two manuscripts underscores how 
Western Europe had been transformed from an oral to a written 
culture, in part a result of Charlemagne’s ambitions and policies. 


THE LINDAU GOSPELS COVER The Reims style (see figs. 
10.14 and 10.15) is also apparent in the reliefs on the front cover 
of the Lindau Gospels (fig. 10.16), dating from the third quarter of 
the ninth century, in the expressive, near-frenetic figures that float 
around the image of the crucified Christ. Given the Carolingian 
investment in preserving and embellishing the written word, the 
cover was a fittingly sumptuous protection for a book. The clus¬ 
ters of semiprecious stones are not mounted directly on the gold 
ground but raised on clawed feet or arcaded turrets (towerlike 
projections), so that light can penetrate from beneath to bring out 
their full brilliance. The raised stones also protect the delicate fig¬ 
ures in repousse, produced from relatively thin gold sheets, when 
the book is opened flat. Christ betrays no hint of pain or death. 
He seems to stand rather than to hang, his arms spread out in a 
solemn gesture.

Architecture 

Although relatively few Carolingian buildings survive, excava¬ 
tions demonstrate a significant increase in building activity during 
the Carolingian period, a reflection of the security and prosperity 
that Charlemagne established at the beginning of his reign and 
that continued for some time. As was the case with his painters, 
Charlemagne’s architects sought to revive the splendor of the 
Roman Empire, which they did by erecting buildings whose 


models were largely from Rome and Ravenna, both of which 
Charlemagne visited. While Rome had been the capital of the 
Empire, Ravenna had been a Christian imperial outpost, and thus 
a worthy prototype for what Charlemagne hoped to create in his 
own land. 

PALACE CHAPEL OF CHARLEMAGNE, AACHEN Toward 
the end of the eighth century, Charlemagne erected his imperial 
palace at Aachen. Prior to this time, Charlemagne’s court had

been itinerant, moving from place to place as the political situa¬ 
tion required. Now, to signify Charlemagne’s position as a 
Christian ruler, architects modeled his palace complex on 
Constantines Lateran Palace in Rome. Charlemagne’s palace 
included a basilica, called the Royal Hall, which was linked to the 
Palace Chapel. The plan for the latter (fig. 10.17) was probably 
inspired by the church of San Vitale in Ravenna, which the 
emperor saw first hand (see figs. 8.21-8.24). The building (fig. 
10.18) was designed by Odo of Metz, probably the earliest 
architect north of the Alps known to us by name. Einhard, 
Charlemagne’s trusted advisor and biographer, supervised the 
project. 

The debt to San Vitale is especially clear in cross section (fig. 
10.19; compare fig. 8.22). The chapel design is by no means a mere

ABBEY CHURCH OF S Al N T-RIQU IE R An even more elab¬ 
orate westwork formed part of one of the greatest basilican 
churches of Carolingian times: the Abbey church of Saint-Riquier 
at the monastery of Centula in northeastern France. (An abbey is 
a religious community headed by an abbot, or, in the case of a 
womens community, an abbess.) The monastery was rebuilt in 
790 by Abbot Angilbert, a poet and scholar of Charlemagne s 
court. The present church was largely built in the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries, but we know the Carolingian design from 
descriptions, drawings, and prints, such as the engraving repro¬ 
duced here (fig. 10.20). The monastery included not only the 
abbey church, dedicated to Saint-Riquier, but also two chapels, 
one dedicated to St. Mary, the other to St. Benedict, founder of the 
Benedictine order, whose Rule the monks followed. (See Primary 
Source , page 331.) 

Benedict of Nursia established his order in 529 when he 
founded a monastery in Monte Cassino, south of Rome. 
Benedict s Rule required monks to labor, study, and pray, provid¬ 
ing for both the sound administration of the monastery and the 


echo of San Vitale but a vigorous reinterpretation of it. Piers and 
vaults are impressively massive by comparison, while the geomet¬ 
ric clarity of the spatial units is very different from the fluid space 
of the earlier structure. To construct such a building on northern 
soil was a difficult undertaking. Columns and bronze gratings 
were imported from Italy, and expert stonemasons must have 
been hard to find. The columns are placed within the arches of the 
upper story, where they are structurally unnecessary, but where 
they accentuate a sense of support and create opportunities to 
offer Roman details. San Vitale had been designed to be ambigu¬ 
ous, to produce an otherworldly interior space. Aachen, by com¬ 
parison, is sturdy and sober. The soft, bulging curvilinear forms of 
San Vitale s arcades are here replaced with clear-cut piers, which 
make manifest their ability to support the heavy weight of 
Aachen’s dome, while the San Vitale dome seems light and to 
hover above the interior space of the building. 

Equally important is Odo s scheme for the western entrance, 
now largely obscured by later additions and rebuilding. At San 
Vitale, the entrance consists of a broad, semidetached narthex 
with twin stair turrets, placed at an odd angle to the main axis of 
the church. At Aachen, these elements are molded into a tall, 
compact unit, in line with the main axis and attached to the chapel 
itself. This monumental structure, known as a westwork (from 
the German Westwerk ), makes one of its first appearances here. 

Charlemagne placed his throne in the tribune (the gallery of 
the westwork), behind the great opening above the entrance. 
From here, the emperor could emerge to show himself to those 
assembled in the atrium below. The throne faced an altar dedi¬ 
cated to Christ, who seemed to bless the emperor from above in 
the dome mosaic. Thus, although contemporary documents say 
very little about its function, the westwork seems to have served 
initially as a royal compartment or chapel.

Hariulf( ca. 1060-1143) 

From History of the Monastery of Saint-Riquier 


Hariulfwas a monk at Saint-Riquier until 1105, when he became abbot 
of St. Peter's at Oudenbourg in Belgium. 

T he church dedicated to the Savior and St. Richarius ... was 
among all other churches of its time the most famous. ... The 
eastern tower is close to the sepulcher of St. Richarius. ... The west¬ 
ern tower is especially dedicated to the Savior. ... 


If one surveys the place, one sees that the largest church, that of 
St. Richarius, lies to the north. The second, somewhat smaller one, 
which has been built in honor of our Lady on this side of the river, 
lies to the south. The third one, the smallest, lies to the east. The clois¬ 
ters of the monks are laid out in a triangular fashion, one roof extend¬ 
ing from St. Richarius’ to St. Marys, one from St. Marys to St. 
Benedicts and one from St. Benedicts to St. Richarius’. ... The 
monastery is so arranged that, according to the rule laid down by St. 
Benedict, all arts and all necessary labors can be executed within its 
walls. The river flows through it, and turns the mill of the brothers.

spiritual needs of individual monks. (See www.myartslab.com. ) 
By the ninth century, largely due to support from Charlemagne, 
Benedict’s requirements for monastic life had been accepted by 
monasteries across Europe. Charlemagne recognized that the 
orderliness of the Rule was consistent with his own goal to pro¬ 
vide stability through a sound, working system of governance, 
both civil and religious. 

The three buildings of the monastery at Centula are connected 
by a covered walkway, forming a triangular cloister (an open 
court surrounded by a covered arcaded walk, used for meditation, 
study, and exercise). This shape has symbolic significance, reflect¬ 
ing this particular monastery’s dedication to the Holy Trinity. The 
plan of Saint-Riquier reads as a traditional basilica, with a central 
nave flanked by side aisles and terminating in a transept and apse. 
In fact, Charlemagne sent to Rome for drawings and measure¬ 
ments of traditional basilicas to guide his local builders. In eleva¬ 
tion, however, Saint-Riquier’s multiple towers provide vertical 
accents that are very different from the longitudinal silhouette of 
Early Christian basilicas, such as Old St. Peter’s (see fig. 8.8). 

The westwork of Saint-Riquier balanced the visual weight of 
the transept and east end of the church; it also provided additional 
room for the liturgical needs of a large community, which num¬ 
bered some 300 monks, 100 novices, and numerous staff (see www. 
myartslab.com) . Twenty-five relics related to Christ were displayed 
in the westwork entrance, and above that was an upper chapel 
dedicated to the Savior. On feast days, and in particular at Easter, 
the community positioned itself here for the beginning of an elab¬ 
orate processional liturgy. (See Primary Source , page 332.) Thus, 
to some extent the westwork functioned as a separate commemo¬ 
rative building, the conceptual equivalent of the Early Christian 
mausoleum and martyrium, but now attached to a basilican church. 

ABBEY CHURCH, CORVEY Saint-Riquier was widely imi¬ 
tated in other Carolingian monastery churches. The best- 
preserved example is the abbey church at Corvey (fig. 10.21), built 
in 873-85. Except for the upper stories, which date from around 
1146, the westwork retains much of its original appearance. It is 
impressive not only because of its height but also because of its 
expansive surfaces, which emphasize the clear geometry and pow¬ 
erful masses of the exterior. The westwork provided a suitably

St. An gilbert (ca. 750-814) 



From Customary for the Different Devotions 

Angilbert , a member of Charlemagne's court , became lay abbot of 
Saint-Riquier in 781 and sponsored the monastery's rebuilding. His 
description reveals how the resident monks moved from one part of the 
basilica to another while chanting the devotions prescribed in the Rule 
of St. Benedict. 

W hen the brethren have sung Vespers and Matins at the altar of 
the Savior, then one choir should descend on the side of the 
holy Resurrection, the other one on the side of the holy Ascension, 


and having prayed there the processions should in the same fashion 
as before move singing toward the altars of St. John and St. Martin. 
After having prayed they should enter from both sides through the 
arches in the middle of the church and pray at the holy Passion. From 
there they should go to the altar of St. Richarius. After praying they 
should divide themselves again as before and go to the altars of 
St. Stephen and St. Lawrence and from there go singing and praying 
to the altar of the Holy Cross. Thence they should go again to the 
altar of St. Maurice and through the long gallery to the church of 
St. Benedict.

regal entrance, which may well be its greatest significance. But it 
had functional benefits too. At Corvey, musical notation 
scratched on the walls of the gallery reminds us that the boys 5 
choir would have been positioned here, its voices spreading 
upward as well as throughout the church. 


PLAN OF A MONASTERY, ST- CALL The importance of 
monasteries in the culture of the early medieval period and their 
close link with the imperial court are evident in the plan for a 
monastery at St. Gall in Switzerland (fig. 10.22). The plan exists in 
a large, unique drawing on five sheets of parchment sewn together

and is preserved in the chapter library at St. Gall. This drawing 
was sent by Abbot Haito of Reichenau to Gozbert, the abbot of 
St. Gall, for “you to study only,” as an aid to him in rebuilding his 
monastery. We may therefore regard it as a model or ideal plan, to 
be modified to meet local needs. 

The monastery plan shows a complex, self-contained unit 
filling a rectangle about 500 by 700 feet and providing a logical 
arrangement of buildings based on their function. From the west 
end of the monastery, the main entrance path passes between 
stables and a hostelry toward a gate. This admits the visitor to a 
colonnaded semicircular portico (porch) flanked by two round 
towers forming a westwork that would have loomed above the 
low outer buildings. The plan emphasizes the church as the 
center of the monastic community. This church is a traditional 
basilica (see figs. 8.7-8.9), with an apse at each end. The nave and 
aisles, which contain many other altars, do not form a single con¬ 
tinuous space but are subdivided into compartments by screens. 
There are numerous entrances: two beside the western apse, 
others on the north and south flanks. 

This arrangement reflects the functions of a monastery 
church, which was designed for the liturgical needs of the monks 
rather than for a lay congregation. Adjoining the church to the 
south is an arcaded cloister, around which are grouped the monks’ 
dormitory (on the east side), a refectory (dining hall) and kitchen 
(on the south side), and a cellar. The three large buildings north of 
the church are a guesthouse, a school, and the abbots house. To 
the east are an infirmary, a chapel, and quarters for novices (new 
members of the community), the cemetery (marked by a large 
cross), a garden, and coops for chickens and geese. On the south 
side are workshops, barns, and other service buildings. 

The St. Gall plan was laid out using a module (standard unit). 
This module, expressed as parts or multiples of 2Vi feet, can be 
found throughout the plan, from the division of the church to 
the length of the cemetery plots. The imposition of a module on 
the plan of St. Gall is a tangible manifestation both of the admin¬ 
istrative orderliness and stability so sought after by Charlemagne 
and of the aims of monasticism, as defined by St. Benedict of 
Nursia’s Rule. 

Unfortunately, political stability proved elusive. Upon the 
death of Charlemagne’s son, Louis I, in 840, a bitter battle arose 
among Louis’s sons for the empire built by their grandfather. The 
brothers eventually signed a treaty in 843 dividing the empire into 
western, central, and eastern parts: Charles the Bald became the 
West Frankish King, founding the French Carolingian dynasty in 
what became modern France; Louis the German became the 
East Frankish King, ruling an area roughly equivalent to that of 
present-day Germany; and Lothair I became the Holy Roman 
Emperor, ruling the middle area running from the Netherlands 
down to Italy. The distribution of the Carolingian domain among 
Louis’s heirs weakened the empire, brought a halt to Carolingian 
cultural efforts, and eventually exposed continental Europe to 
attack by the Muslims from the south, the Slavs and Magyars 
from the east, and the Vikings from the north. As stated earlier, 
the Vikings invaded northwestern France and, through a land 


grant from Charles the Bald, occupied the area now known as 
Normandy. 

Although political stability ultimately eluded Charlemagne’s 
heirs, the artists of the Carolingian period were able to create an 
enduring art that combined the northern reliance on decoration— 
on surface, pattern, and line—with the Mediterranean concern for 
solidity and monumentality. Carolingian art was to serve as a 
worthy model for emulation by artists and patrons when the 
revival of Charlemagne’s vision of a united and stable Europe 
reappeared during the next centuries. 

OTTONI AN ART 

When the last East Frankish monarch died in 911, the center of 
political power moved to the eastern portion of the former 
Carolingian Empire, in an area roughly equivalent to present-day 
Germany, under German kings of Saxon descent. Beginning with 
Henry I, these kings pushed back invaders, reestablished an effec¬ 
tive central government, improved trade and the economy, and 
began a new dynasty, called Ottoman after its three principal 
rulers: Otto I, Otto II, and Otto III. During the Ottoman period, 
which lasted from 919 to 1024, Germany was the leading nation 
of Europe politically and artistically. In both realms, German 
achievements began as revivals of Carolingian traditions but soon 
developed an original character. 

The greatest of the Ottoman kings, Otto I, revived the impe¬ 
rial ambitions of Charlemagne. After marrying the widow of a 
Lombard king in 951, he extended his rule over most of what is 
now northern Italy. Then, in 962, he was crowned emperor by 
Pope John XII, whom the emperor later deposed for conspiring 
against him, insisting on the imperial right to designate future 
popes. 

Architecture 

Among the most pressing concerns of the Ottoman emperors was 
the reform of the Church, which had become corrupt and mis¬ 
managed. They did this by establishing closer alliances with the 
papacy and by fostering monastic reforms, which they supported 
by sponsoring many new religious buildings. The renewal of 
impressive building programs effectively revived the architectural 
ambitions of their Carolingian predecessors, while at the same 
time conveying and furthering the Ottomans’ aspirations to 
restore the imperial glory of Christian Rome. 

NUNNERY CHURCH OF ST. CYRIAKUS, GERNRODE 

One of the best-preserved Ottoman churches was built in 961 for 
the nunnery, or convent, at Gernrode (fig. 10.23), founded by 
Gero, margrave (military governor) under Otto I. The church was 
dedicated to St. Cyriakus and used the basic form of the Early 
Christian basilica (see figs. 8.7-8.9), which had also dominated 
architectural planning during the Carolingian period. However, 
the architect of St. Cyriakus raised the apse above the level of the 


CHAPTER 10 EARLY MEDIEVAL ART 333

rest of the church to make room for a half-buried basement 
chapel, or crypt, a feature not present in the Early Christian basil¬ 
ica. Such crypts with ambulatories, usually housing the venerated 
tomb of a saint, had been introduced into Western church archi¬ 
tecture during Carolingian times. Moreover, at St. Cyriakus, a 
gallery has been inserted between the nave arcade and the 
clerestory. A series of columns and piers divide the gallery in such 
a way that the piers of the gallery are positioned over the piers of 
the nave arcade. This provides a series of repeated vertical accents, 
effectively dividing the building into vertical sections. 

This emphasis on verticality is different from the overwhelm¬ 
ing effect of horizontality that characterizes Early Christian 
buildings, and indicates a trend that will be significant in the later 
development of medieval architecture. Neither the origin nor the 
intended function of the gallery is clear. Some scholars have noted 


similarities to galleried Byzantine churches, such as two fifth- 
century examples in Salonika in Greece. It is possible that the 
gallery at St. Cyriakus contained altars, as was the case in the 
galleried westworks of Carolingian churches, such as at Corvey 
(see fig. 10.21). 

ST- MICHAEL’S AT HILDESHEIM The most ambitious 
patron of architecture and art in the Ottonian age was Bernward, 
who became bishop of Hildesheim after having been court chap¬ 
lain. Bernward was also tutor of Otto III during the regency of 
his mother, Empress Theophano, wife of Otto II and a Byzantine 
princess in her own right. Bernward s chief monument is the 
Benedictine abbey church of St. Michael s at Hildesheim. The 
plan of this monastic church (fig. 10.24) derives from that of 
Saint-Riquier at Centula (see fig. 10.20). With its two choirs and 


334 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 

















1 0.24 Reconstructed plan, abbey church of St. Michael’s, Hildesheim, 
Germany. 1001-33 (after Beseler) 

side entrances, it also recalls the monastery church of the St. Gall 
plan (see fig. 10.22). However, in St. Michaels the symmetry is 
carried much further. There are two identical transepts, each with 
a tower, where the transept and the nave cross, and a pair of stair 


turrets at the end of each transept (fig. 10.25; see also fig. 10.24). 
But the supports of the nave arcade, instead of being uniform, 
consist of pairs of columns separated by square piers (fig. 10.26). 
This alternating system divides the arcade into three equal units, 
each with three openings. These units are equal in length to the 
width of the transepts, which are similarly divided into three 
compartments. 

Thus, as in the St. Gall plan, a modular system governs the 
division of spaces. The module can also be seen on the exterior of 
the building, which reads as a series of cubes arranged by stack¬ 
ing. The first and third units correspond with the entrances, thus 
echoing the axis of the transepts. Moreover, since the aisles and 
nave are unusually wide in relation to their length, the architect s 
intention must have been to achieve a harmonious balance 
between the longitudinal and horizontal axes throughout the 
structure. 

St. Michaels was severely damaged during World War II, but 
the restored interior retains the majestic feel of the original design. 
Frescoes originally decorated the great expanse of wall space 
between the arcade and clerestory, paralleling the arrangement of

mosaics in Early Christian basilicas such as Santa Maria Maggiore 
(see fig. 8.16). (The capitals of the columns date from the twelfth 
century; the painted wooden ceiling from the thirteenth.) The 
western choir is especially interesting. As at Gernrode (see fig. 
10.23), there is a raised crypt. Monks could enter the crypt (appar¬ 
ently a special sanctuary for relics of the saint) from both the 
transept and the west. Arched openings pierced the walls and 
linked the crypt with the U-shaped ambulatory wrapped around 
it. The ambulatory must originally have been visible from above 
ground, where it enriched the exterior of the choir, since there 
were windows in its outer wall. The design of St. Michael s is dis¬ 
tinguished by the crypt s large scale and its careful integration 
with the rest of the building. 


Metalwork 

The Ottonian emperors’ reliance on church authority to 
strengthen their own governmental rule encouraged them not 
only to build new churches but also to provide sumptuous works 
of art to decorate them. The works they and their cohorts spon¬ 
sored were richly appointed and executed in expensive, often 
precious materials. 

BRONZE DOORS OF BISHOP BERNWARD, HILDESHEIM 

For St. Michael s at Hildesheim, Bernward commissioned a pair 
of extensively sculptured bronze doors (figs. 10.27 and 10.28) that 
were finished in 1015, the year the crypt was consecrated.

According to his biographer, Thangmar of Heidelberg, Bernward 
excelled in the arts and “distinguished himself remarkably in the 
science of metalwork and the whole art of building. ” So, he must 
have been closely involved in the project. The idea for the doors 
may have come to him as a result of his visit to Rome, where he 
would have seen ancient Roman (and perhaps Byzantine) doors 
of bronze and wood. He would also certainly have been aware of 
the bronze doors that Charlemagne had commissioned for his 
palace chapel at Aachen. 

The doors at Hildesheim are considered by many scholars to 
be the first monumental sculptures created by the lost-wax 
process (see page 128) since antiquity. Each door was cast as one 
piece and measures over 16 feet in height. They are also the first 
doors since the Early Christian period to have been decorated 
with stories. Our detail (fig. 10.29) shows God accusing and judg¬ 
ing Adam and Eve after the Temptation and Fall, when they have 
committed the Original Sin of eating the forbidden fruit in the 
Garden of Eden. Below it, in inlaid letters notable for their classi¬ 
cal Roman character, is part of an inscription, with the date and 
Bernward s name. This inscription was added around 1035, when 
the doors were moved from the monastery of St. Michael and

attached to the westwork of Hildesheim cathedral, where they 
would have been seen by a larger public than in the monastic set¬ 
ting of St. Michaels. The new, more prominent setting indicates 
how valued they were in their own time. 

The composition most likely derives from a manuscript illu¬ 
mination, since there are very similar scenes in medieval Bibles. 
Yet this is no mere imitation. The story is conveyed with splendid 
directness and expressive force. The accusing finger of the Lord, 
seen against a great void, is the focal point of the drama. It points 
to a cringing Adam, who passes the blame to Eve, who in turn 
passes it to the serpent at her feet. The trees and landscape ele¬ 
ments are in relatively low relief and remain sketchy, which 
encourages them to be read as background elements, while the 
figures, though of awkward proportions, project forward so that 
the heads are three-dimensional. 

The subjects on the left door are taken from the Hebrew Bible 
and those on the right from the New Testament (see fig. 10.28). 
The Hebrew Bible stories are presented chronologically from top 
to bottom, while the New Testament scenes move in reverse 
order, from bottom to top, suggesting the Christian message is 
uplifting. When read as horizontal pairs, the panels deliver a mes¬ 
sage of the origin and redemption of sin through a system of 
typology, whereby the Hebrew Bible stories prefigure New 
Testament ones. For example, the Temptation and Fall (fig. 10.30) 
is opposite the Crucifixion. In the center of the left panel is the tree 
whose fruit led to the Original Sin; in the center of the right panel 
is the cross on which Jesus was crucified, which medieval 


Christians believed was made from the wood of the tree from 
Eden and was therefore the instrument for redemption from the 
sin of that original act. Compositional similarities between the 
two scenes stress their typological relationship: In the left panel 
Adam and Eve s hands, which flank the cross-shaped tree, estab¬ 
lish a visual parallel to the spears the soldiers use to pierce Christ s 
body on the right panel. 

Eve plays a particularly significant role on the doors; in 
fact, the narrative begins with her formation, not with the creation 
of Adam, as might be expected, since according to the Bible 
Adams creation antecedes Eves. In the Temptation and Fall , 
Eve s attitude and gesture parallel those of the serpent at the right, 
who, like Eve, offers an apple. This makes explicit Eve s role as 
seductive agent, accentuated by the way she holds the apple so 
closely to her chest that it almost appears as if she were grasping 
her breast rather than the fruit. With this gesture Eve s guilt in 
humankind s exile from Paradise is emphasized and her sexuality 
underscored. 

While Early Christian writers had considered Eve responsible 
for the Original Sin, during the Ottonian period references to her 
guilt multiply and become more vigorous. This might have been 
as a result of efforts by Bishop Bernward and others to reform the 
morality of the clergy in an attempt to restore the vow of celibacy 
to priests and monks, some of whom were known to cohabit with 
wives and children in their monasteries. Thus, the burden of cler¬ 
ical immorality is, in effect, assigned to Eve, the first woman and 
the first seductress. 


CHAPTER 10 EARLY MEDIEVAL ART 339 








Ivories and Manuscripts: 

Conveyors of Imperial Grandeur 

The right of the Ottoman monarchs to call themselves Roman 
emperors was challenged by Byzantine rulers, who continued to 
claim that title as their own even though the division of the 
Roman Empire into Eastern and Western empires was complete 
by the end of the fourth century. When Otto II married the 
Byzantine princess Theophano, he was able to use the full title of

Holy Roman Emperor with impunity. While early Ottonian 
illuminators faithfully replicated features of Carolingian manu¬ 
scripts, later Ottonian manuscripts, as well as ivories, blend 
Carolingian and Byzantine elements into a new style of extraor¬ 
dinary scope and power. Byzantine artists working for the court 
provided an impetus to find new ways of presenting both 
religious and imperial images. Ottonian manuscripts indicate an 
increasing interest on the part of artists and patrons in narrative 
cycles of Jesus’ life, which is the period’s most important contri¬ 
bution to the field of iconography (the study of the use and 
meaning of images in art). 

CHRIST BLESSING OTTO II AND THEOPHANO An 

ivory of Christ Blessing Emperor Otto II and Empress Theophano 
(fig. 10.31) commemorated their coronation, presenting it as 
divinely sanctioned. In style, the ivory is similar to the Byzantine 
ivory of Christ Crowning Romanos and Eudokia (see fig. 8.41), 
carved a generation or so earlier. The composition of both works 
is identical: A long-haired, bearded Christ (identified by a halo 
inscribed with a cross) is elevated in the center of each panel and 
anoints the empress and emperor, who flank him. In both ivories, 
the imperial costumes are composed of similar elaborate geomet¬ 
ric surface decorations. This similarity suggests that the Otto II 
ivory is an eastern import, as does the inscription, which seems to 
be the work of a Greek using both Greek and Latin letters. 
However, because Otto’s costume is not accurate for a Byzantine 
ruler’s coronation, and because the inscription tells us that the 
donor—who huddles in front of Otto’s stool and grasps the leg of 
the larger stool that supports Christ—was an Ottonian bishop 
who lived in Italy, it is more likely that the ivory was produced 
within Ottonian lands in Italy. No matter where this work was 
produced, it demonstrates the interest of the Ottonian court in 
importing Byzantine style as well as actual objects, thus establish¬ 
ing on another level a connection to the art of the Mediterranean. 
Here again, the king is presented as the Holy Roman Emperor, a 
divinely ordained ruler. 

THE GOSPEL BOOK OF OTTO III Produced for the son of 

Otto II and Theophano, the Gospel Book of Otto III communi¬ 
cates an imperial grandeur equal to that of the coronation ivory of 
his parents. In figure 10.32 the emperor displays the imperial 
regalia—a crown, an eagle scepter, and a cross-inscribed orb— 
while his throne is decorated with imperial lions. Representatives 
of the two domains that he controls—the military and the eccle¬ 
siastical—flank him, reminiscent of Justinian’s placement in the 
center of the same domains in the San Vitale mosaic (see fig. 8.25). 
On the facing folio, the four geographical parts of the realm— 
Slavinia, Germania, Gallia, and Roma—offer homage. Their 
stances recall traditional representations of the Magi offering gifts 
to Christ, such as the scene decorating Theodora’s robe in the 
mosaic at San Vitale in Ravenna (see fig. 8.26). 

The manuscript is dated to around 1000, not long after Otto 
III was crowned king of Germany at Aachen in 986 and Holy 
Roman Emperor at Rome in 993. The way Otto is represented

visually in the manuscript thus parallels historical facts. He is 
presented here as the rightful and worthy heir to Roman and 
Byzantine emperors as well as to Charlemagne, and his imperial 
dignity is enhanced by association with Christ, a reversal of the 
practice in Early Christian depictions, where Christ is ennobled 
in the fashion of a Roman emperor. The soft pastel hues of the 
background recall the illusionism of Graeco-Roman landscapes 
and the Quedlinburg Itala fragment (see fig. 8.18). Such a style 
shows that the artist was probably aware of Roman, as well as 
Byzantine, manners of representation. 

The Gospel Book of Otto III contains one of the most exten¬ 
sive sets of illustrations of the life of Christ. The scene of Jesus 
Washing the Feet of St. Peter (fig. 10.33) once again contains strong 
echoes of ancient painting, transmitted through Byzantine art. 
The architectural frame around Jesus is a late descendant of the 
kind of architectural perspectives we saw in Roman wall painting 
(see figs. 7.54 and 7.56), and the intense gold background reminds 
us of Byzantine painting and mosaics, which the Ottoman artist 
has put to new use. What was an architectural vista in the mural

from Boscoreale (see fig. 7.54) now becomes the Heavenly City, 
the House of the Lord, filled with golden celestial space in con¬ 
trast with the atmospheric earthly space outside. 

The figures have also been transformed. In ancient art, this 
composition, in which a standing figure extends an arm to a seated 
supplicating figure and is watched by bystanders and assisted by 
others, was used to depict a doctor treating a patient. Here, though, 
the emphasis has shifted from physical to spiritual action. Not 
only do glances and gestures convey this new kind of action, but 
so too does scale. Jesus and his apostle Peter, the most animated 
figures, are larger than the rest, and Jesus’ “active” arm is longer 
than his “passive” one. And the eight apostles, who are compressed 
into a tiny space and merely watch, have less physical substance 
than the fanlike Early Christian crowd from which this grouping 
derives (see fig. 8.17). The blending of Classical and Byzantine 
elements results in a new style of expressive abstraction. 


A miniature showing St. Luke from the Gospel Book of Otto 
III (fig. 10.34) is a symbolic image of overwhelming grandeur 
despite its small size. Unlike depictions of evangelists in 
Carolingian manuscripts (see figs. 10.13 and 10.14), here St. Luke 
is not shown writing. Instead, his Gospel lies completed on his 
lap. The evangelist seems to be as much a part of the mystical 
scene as he is its presenter. Enthroned on two rainbows, Luke 
holds aloft an awesome cluster of clouds from which tongues of 
light radiate in every direction. Within it we see his symbol, the 
ox, surrounded by five Hebrew prophets and an outer circle of 
angels. At the bottom, two lambs drink the life-giving waters that 
spring from beneath his feet. The key to the design is in the 
inscription: Fonte patrum ductas bos agnis elicit undas (“From the 
source of the fathers, the ox brings forth a flow of water for the 
lambs”). The Ottoman artist has truly “illuminated” the meaning 
of this terse phrase.

Sculpture 

Large-scale and free-standing sculpture was rare in the early 
Middle Ages, in part because of the lingering fear of idol worship 
and because the general interest in producing portable objects 
virtually precluded its production. However, during the Ottonian 
period the scale of sculpture increased (witness Bernward s doors 
for St. Michael s at Hildesheim), and even many small-scale works 
demonstrate an imposing monumentality. 

THE CERO CRUCIFIX The Gero Crucifix (fig. 10.35), 
named for Archbishop Gero of Cologne, who commissioned it 
around 970, is an example of a large-scale work—it is in fact 
life-size—with a monumental presence, indicative of the major 


transformation that Ottonian sculptors were able to achieve even 
when dealing with traditional subjects. How this happens is 
evident if we compare the Gero Crucifix with the Christ on the 
cover of the Lindau Gospels (see fig. 10.16). The two works are 
separated by little more than 100 years but show marked contrast. 
The Gero Crucifix presents a sculptural image that is new to 
Western art, since for the first time a dead Christ is represented on 
the Cross. Made of painted and gilded oak, it is carved in power¬ 
fully rounded forms. Particularly striking is the forward bulge of 
the heavy body, which emphasizes the physical strain on the arms 
and shoulders, making the pain seem almost unbearable. The face, 
with its deeply incised, angular features, is a mask of agony from 
which all life has fled. The image is filled with deep feeling for 
Christ s suffering.

How did the Ottonian sculptor arrive at this bold conception? 
The Gero Crucifix was clearly influenced by Middle Byzantine 
art, which had created the compassionate view of Christ on the 
Cross in other mediums (see fig. 8.45). Yet, that source alone is 
not enough to explain the results. It remained for the Ottonian 
artist to translate the Byzantine image into large-scale sculptural 
terms and to replace its gentle pathos with expressive realism. 
Even though there were some clerics who rekindled the deep- 
rooted fear of idolatry, they could not restrain the newly found 
emphasis on the humanity of Christ or the increasing interest in 
relics, which were, after all, three-dimensional objects. In fact, 
there is a space in the back of the head of the Gero Christ to hold 
the Host (the bread or wafer taken during that part of the Mass 
referred to as Communion), transforming the sculpture into a 
reliquary (a container to enshrine holy remnants or relics). 

THE VIRGIN OF ESSEN The Virgin ofEssen (fig. 10.36), given 
to the Cathedral of Essen around 980 by Abbess Matilda, grand¬ 
daughter of Otto I, was almost certainly designed as a reliquary, 
although that is hard to establish definitively since the sculpture s 
original wooden core does not survive. All that is left is the 
exterior covering of gold sheets. Matilda also donated two—and 
possibly three—gold, enamel, and jeweled crosses to the cathe¬ 
dral. This rich treasure, glittering on candlelit altars, would have 
made an impressive display and signaled the church s patronage 
by a member of the imperial family. The Virgin of Essen is one of 
the earliest free-standing sculptures of the Virgin Mary. The 
golden apple Mary holds symbolizes her typological status as the 
new Eve; thus, the sculpture is related conceptually to the message 
on Bernwards bronze doors (see fig. 10.27). 

Despite the tender, almost doll-like figures of Mary and 
Christ, the Virgin of Essen has a commanding presence. This is due 
to Mary s frontal pose, her large staring eyes, and the brilliance of 
the gold, which is enhanced by the gems, enamels, and filigree that 
decorate the apple and Christ s book and halo. Linear details, such 
as drapery folds, and facial features are suppressed to place 
emphasis on the figure s corporeality. Thus, although employing 
some early medieval metalwork materials and techniques that 
stretch back to the Anglo-Saxon period and to still-earlier 
traditions as well, the Essen Madonna has moved away from the 
traditional Germanic concentration on line and surface effect. 
Despite her small size—less than 2 X A feet high—the simplification 
of form and the concentration on abstract shapes result in a 
marked movement toward monumentality, which also character¬ 
ized the Gero Crucifix. These works herald new aesthetic 
aims that will dominate eleventh-century sculpture throughout 
western Europe.

Romanesque Art 



R omanesque means, literally, “in the roman manner.” we use 

this stylistic term today to identify the art of much of the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries. The borrowing of details or specific features from the 
antique past does not distinguish Romanesque art from the art of other 
post-Classical periods, for the artists of these periods also relied heavily on Rome 


for their formal and expressive languages. However, in 
Romanesque art, the aesthetic integrity and grandeur of the 
Roman model survive in a more vital and compelling form than in 
previous periods. Yet Rome was not the period s only inspiration: 
Romanesque artists tapped sources in Carolingian and Ottoman 
art, and were influenced by Early Christian, Byzantine, Celtic- 
Germanic, and Islamic traditions as well. 

While Carolingian and Ottonian art developed principally in 
response to the patronage of the royal courts, Romanesque art 
sprang up all over western Europe at about the same time and in 
a variety of regional styles that are nevertheless closely related. 
What welded this variety into a coherent style was not any single 
force but several factors. 

For one thing, Christianity was close to triumphing every¬ 
where in Europe. The Vikings, still largely pagan in the ninth and 
tenth centuries when their raids terrorized the British Isles and 
the Continent, had finally entered the Catholic fold, not only in 
Normandy but in Scandinavia as well. Meanwhile, in 1031, the 
caliphate of Cordoba had broken up into many small Muslim 
states, opening the way for Christian conquest of the Iberian 
peninsula. 

Another factor was the growing spirit of religious enthusiasm. 
The year 1000—the millennium—had come and gone without the

apocalyptic end of the world that many had predicted from their 
reading of the book of Revelation in the Bible. Chapter 20 of this 
New Testament book, written about 50 years after Jesus’ death, 
prophesizes that the Second Coming, when Christ will return to 
earth and end the world as we know it, would occur after 1,000 
years. Many people, fearing the end of days, reacted to the 
approach of the year 1000 with terror and to its smooth passing 
with great relief and, in some quarters, a heightened spirituality. 
This was demonstrated by the large number of people making 
pilgrimages to sacred sites, by repeated Christian Crusades 
against the Muslims in the Holy Land, and by an increase in the 
number and size of monasteries. 

A general growth in population and an increase in prosperity 
during the Romanesque period are also significant, as was the 
reopening of the Mediterranean trade routes by the navies of 
Venice, Genoa, Amalfi, Pisa, and Rimini. The revival of trade and 
travel linked Europe commercially and culturally, stimulating the 
flowering of urban life. 

At the end of the early medieval period, Europe was still 
largely an agricultural society. A decentralized political and social 
system, known today as feudalism, had begun to develop, mainly 
in France and Germany, where it had deep historical roots. In this 
system, landowning lords granted some of their property to 
knights (originally, these were cavalry officers). In return for these 
fiefs, or feuds, as the land parcels were called, the knights gave 
military and other service to their lords, to whom they were

linked through a complex system of personal bonds—termed 
vassalage—that extended all the way to the king. A large class of 
generally downtrodden, virtually powerless peasants (serfs) 
worked the land itself. Towns that had shrunk in size during the 
migrations and invasions of the early Middle Ages—Rome, for 
instance, with about 1 million people in 300, fell to less than 
50,000 at one point, and some smaller cities were deserted alto¬ 
gether—started to regain their former importance. New towns 
sprang up everywhere, achieving independence via charters that 
enumerated a towns privileges and immunities in return for a 
feudal lord s guarantee of protection. 

These social changes were made possible by technological 
advances in agriculture, such as improved milling machinery and 
better iron plows that dug deeper furrows. For the first time since 
the Fall of Rome, farmers could grow more food than they 


needed for themselves. In many ways, then, western Europe 
between 1050 and 1200 became a great deal more “Roman-esque” 
than it had been since the sixth century. It recaptured some of the 
trade patterns, the urban quality, and the military strength of 
ancient imperial times. Despite Charlemagne’s attempt to unify 
Europe, there was no central political authority, for Europe was 
still divided into small units ruled by powerful families. Even the 
king of France controlled not much more than the area around 
Paris. However, some monasteries came to rival the wealth and 
power of kings, and the central spiritual authority of the pope 
acted as a unifying force throughout Europe. In 1095, Pope 
Urban II called for the First Crusade to liberate the Holy Land 
from Muslim rule and to aid the Byzantine emperor against the 
advancing Turks. The army of crusaders was far larger than any 
secular ruler could have raised for the purpose. 


348 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 














This brief historical account underscores the number of insti¬ 
tutions, organizations, and systems that helped to create 
European stability. Monasticism, feudalism, urbanism, commerce, 
pilgrimage, crusade, papacy, and the royal court all played their 
roles by setting in motion internationalizing forces that affected 
the transmission of artistic forms. Population growth and an 
increase in the number of new settlements stimulated building 
activity, much of it for religious, i.e., Christian use. The develop¬ 
ment of better tools, such as saws to cut stone, resulted in 
improved masonry techniques. Many new constructions were 
made of well-cut, straight-edged blocks of stone and were monu¬ 
mental, built on a scale that rivaled the achievements of Rome. 
Heavy walls created solid and durable structures that conveyed a 
sense of enclosure and security, and the stone vaults covering 
these buildings enhanced their stability. These vaults, as well as 
the proliferation of architectural sculpture, consciously emulated 
the Roman manner of construction and design. Embellishing 
churches and monasteries with reliquaries and other adornments, 
including illuminated manuscripts, provided for the needs of both 
the local population and pilgrims. 

FIRST EXPRESSIONS 
OF ROMANESQUE STYLE 

Although Romanesque art quickly spread throughout Europe, its 
first appearances occur in a zone running from Lombardy in Italy 
through southern France and into northern Spain, into the region 
of Catalonia. Stone-vaulted buildings decorated with wall arcades 
and architectural sculpture, which are characteristic features of 
this early phase, survive in great numbers in these regions. 

Architecture 

The most striking feature of Romanesque art is the amazing increase 
in building activity. An eleventh-century monk, Raoul Glaber, 
conveys the enthusiasm for building that characterizes the period: 

Just before the third year after the millennium, throughout the 
whole world, but most especially in Italy and Gaul, men began 
to reconstruct churches. ... But it seemed as though each 
Christian community were aiming to surpass all others in the 
splendor of construction. It was as if the whole world were 
shaking itself free, shrugging off the burden of the past, and 
cladding itself everywhere in a white mantle of churches. 

J. France, The Five Books of the Histories (Oxford, 1989) 

These churches were not only more numerous than those of the 
early Middle Ages, they were also larger, more richly ornamented, 
and more “Roman-looking. ” Their naves had stone vaults instead 
of wooden roofs, and their exteriors were decorated with both 
architectural ornament and sculpture. Romanesque monuments 
of the first importance are distributed over an area that might well 


have represented the Catholic world: from northern Spain to the 
Rhineland, from the Scottish-English border to central Italy. 

CHURCH OF SANT VINCENT, CARDONA An excellent 
example of an early phase of Romanesque architecture is the 
collegiate church of Sant Vinceng (fig. 11.1), built within the 
walled confines of the castle at Cardona on the southern flank 
of the Catalan Pyrenees. The church, begun in 1029 and conse¬ 
crated in 1040, is straightforward both in plan and in elevation. 
A barrel-vaulted nave creates a continuous space marked off by 
transverse arches into units of space called bays. The domed bay

CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 349 














in front of the chancel (the part of the church containing the altar 
and seats for the clergy) focuses attention on the ceremonial heart 
of the church. Blind niches in the chancel walls establish a rhyth¬ 
mic variety that is accentuated in the nave by the staggered 
cadence of massive compound piers, solid masonry supports with 
rectangular projections attached to their four faces. The projec¬ 
tions reflect the different structural elements that combine to 
support the building. One projection rises the full height of the 
nave to support the transverse arch, another forms the arch that 
extends across the side aisle, and two others connect to the arches 
of the nave arcade. Clearly the architectural effort at Sant Vinceng 
required detailed, systematic planning. Vaulting the nave to elim¬ 
inate the fire hazard of a wooden roof was not only a practical 
necessity, it also challenged architects to make the House of the 
Lord grander. 

Sant Vincents vertical integration of piers and vault is 
undoubtedly derived from the desire to unify the elevation in 
early medieval buildings, for example the Carolingian chapel at 
Aachen (see fig. 10.18) and the Ottoman church at Gernrode (see 
fig. 10.23). However, the wall planes of the Ottonian church 
appear flat by comparison to the angular surfaces of Sant Vinceng, 
where the clarity of articulation endows the building with a 
heightened sense of unity and harmony. The compound pier is, 
in fact, a major architectural innovation of the Romanesque 


period. Limited light and robust stone construction create an inte¬ 
rior at once sheltering and inspiring; the sober arrangement of 
simple yet powerful forms is masterfully realized. 

Monumental Stone Sculpture 

The revival of monumental stone sculpture in the Romanesque 
era is as significant as the architectural achievements of the period. 
Free-standing statues had all but disappeared from Western art 
after the fifth century, and stone relief survived only as architec¬ 
tural ornament or surface decoration, while three-dimensional 
sculpture was rare. Thus, the only sculptural tradition that con¬ 
tinued through the early medieval period was that of sculpture- 
in-miniature: small reliefs and occasional statuettes in metal or 
ivory. In works such as the bronze doors of Bishop Bernward (see 
fig. 10.27), Ottonian art had enlarged the small scale of this 
tradition but had not changed its spirit. Moreover, its truly large- 
scale sculptural efforts, such as the Gero Crucifix (see fig. 10.35), 
were limited almost entirely to wood. 

LINTEL AT S Al N T-GE NIS-D E S-FON T Al N E S The marble 
lintel at Saint-Genis-des-Fontaines, on the French side of the 
Pyrenees, is dated by inscription to between 1020 and 1021 
(fig. 11.2). It spans the doorway of the church and is one of the

earliest examples of Romanesque figurative sculpture. The 
inscription gives the names of the leaders of two stabilizing 
institutions of the period, “Rotberto Rege” (King Robert) and 
“Willelmus Aba” (Abbot William), the former a feudal lord and 
the latter the leader of a monastery. The central motif, Christ in 
Majesty supported by angels, is flanked by six apostles; each apos¬ 
tle holds a book and stands under an arcade. Christ s mandorla is 
formed by two intersecting circles. One symbolizes the earth and 
the other heaven, the two realms over which he presides. 

The Saint-Genis lintel is modest in size, only about 2 feet high 
by 7 feet long. The reliance on line to indicate facial features, 
drapery folds, and ornamental decoration is reminiscent of early 
medieval manuscript illuminations and reaches as far back as the 
Hiberno-Saxon period (see fig. 10.6). The carving, with flat 
surfaces marked by incision, resembles the decorative arts, 
particularly ivory and metalwork. This can be verified by com¬ 
paring some of the patterns (for example, the beading around the 
arches) with metalwork techniques (see fig. 10.1). The correlation 
explains where carvers might have found their sources of inspira¬ 
tion after centuries during which stone sculpture had been 
virtually abandoned. 

Although the figures are rendered with individualized hair¬ 
styles and facial features and with a variety of gestures, they are 
clearly stylized. Each is contained by the frame around him in 
such a way that it is difficult to decide if the figures are governed 
by their frames or if the arches swell in response to the figures. 
The equilibrium between frame and figure parallels the harmo¬ 
nious balance between structure and decoration that characterizes 
early Romanesque buildings such as Sant Vinceng at Cardona. 

MATURE ROMANESQUE 

Early Romanesque experiments in sturdy construction, which 
relied on the skills of masons and sculptors, led to buildings that 
employed both more sculpture and increasingly sophisticated 
vaulting techniques. Sculptural decoration was arranged into 
complicated and didactic iconographic programs. Romanesque 
architecture and sculpture continue to convey messages of secu¬ 
rity and spirituality, employing a consistent aesthetic approach 
that is also visible in the manuscripts and metalwork produced 
during the period. As Romanesque art developed, it spread 
throughout Europe, becoming a pan-European art. 

Pilgrimage Churches and Their Art 

Among the most significant social phenomena of eleventh- and 
twelfth-century Europe was the increased ability of people of all 
classes to travel. While some journeys were made as a result of 
expanded trade, others, such as a crusade or pilgrimage, were 
ostensibly for religious purposes. Individual pilgrims made 
journeys to holy places for different reasons, but most shared 
the hope that they would find special powers or dispensations 
as a result of their journey. Pilgrimage was not a Romanesque 


invention. As early as the late fourth century, Egeria, a Spanish 
pilgrim to Jerusalem, chronicled her visit to the locations central 
to Christ s life, among them the church of the Holy Sepulcher (see 
fig. 8.12). Special, often miraculous, powers associated with these 
holy sites were transferred to relics, those body parts of holy 
persons or objects that had come in contact with Christ, his close 
followers, or other holy figures, particularly his mother, the 
Virgin Mary. 

Partly due to the Muslim conquest of the Holy Land, travel 
there was difficult during the Middle Ages. This led, on the one 
hand, to a zeal for crusade and, on the other, to a veneration of 
places within Europe that had important relics or that had been 
the site of special events. Rome, in particular, became a popular 
pilgrimage site, beneficiary of the aura of sanctity surrounding 
SS. Peter and Paul, both of whom lived and were buried there (see 
page 246). So did Santiago de Compostela on the Iberian penin¬ 
sula. Cultural anthropologists have attempted to account for the 
incredible popularity and significance of pilgrimage to the 
medieval world as well as to our own. They explain that when 
pilgrims embark on their journey they enter a special transitional, 
or liminal, zone where social norms and hierarchies are replaced 
with a sense of shared experience. This creates a temporary con¬ 
dition of community, in which people of disparate backgrounds 
and social levels can communicate as equals. The buildings and 
objects pilgrims saw and experienced fostered this sense of 
community. The pilgrimage and the churches associated with it 
also provided opportunities for pilgrims to experience spiritual ful¬ 
fillment through the journey itself, which demonstrated their piety 
both to themselves and to the world, and through the experience 
of beautiful and moving buildings and the objects they contained. 

SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA The tomb of St. James at 
Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain marked the most 
westerly point of Christian Europe. According to tradition, the 
apostle James (or Santiago in Spanish) had preached Christianity 
on the Iberian peninsula. After returning to the Holy Land, he 
was martyred there and his body was returned to Spain under 
dramatic circumstances. Reports of the tomb s miraculous power 
attracted large numbers of pilgrims from all over Europe. Many 
had to brave a difficult sea journey or an exhausting crossing of 
the Pyrenees mountains in order to reach the apostle s tomb at 
Compostela. (See Primary Source , page 352.) During the twelfth 
century as many as tens of thousands of people might have made 
the journey in a single year. The difficulty of the journey added to 
its allure. Since much of Spain was under Muslim control, 
pilgrims considered the trip to Santiago equivalent to a journey to 
the Muslim-held Holy Land. 

The cathedral at Santiago de Compostela had much to offer 
those brave hearts sufficiently fortunate to reach their goal. The 
plan (fig. 11 . 3 ) includes side aisles that run uninterruptedly 
around the church and form an ambulatory around the apse. 
Visitors used these aisles to circumambulate the space, even when 
the religious offices were being celebrated in the nave and cross¬ 
ing. Apsidioles, or small apselike chapels, arranged along the

The Pilgrim y s Guide 



From Pilgrim s Guide to Santiago de Compostela 

The Pilgrim s Guide, written around 1130, gives a vivid account of the 
routes to Santiago de Compostela and what was to he met along them 
by pilgrims traveling to the shrine of the apostle James there (see map 
11.2, page 354). It also provides interesting information on the person¬ 
nel in charge of the construction of the shrine at the cathedral. 

T here are four roads which, leading to Santiago, converge into one 
near Puente la Reina [see fig. 11.8], in Spanish territory. One goes 
through St-Gilles [see fig. 11.31], Montpellier, Toulouse [see fig. 11.7] 
and [the pass of] Somport; another passes through Notre-Dame of Le 
Puy and Ste-Foy at Conques and Saint-Pierre at Moissac [see figs. 
11.12-11.16]; another proceeds through Ste-Marie-Madeleine of 
Vezelay, St-Leonard of the Limousin and the city of Perigueux; 
another goes by St-Martin of Tours to St-Hilaire of Poitiers, St-Jean- 
d’Angely, St-Eutrope of Saintes and the city of Bordeaux. ... 


After that are the Landes of the Bordelais, a three-days’ journey, 
exhausting to be sure. This is a country devoid of all good things, 
lacking in bread, wine, meat, fish, water and springs, sparse in towns, 
flat, sandy but abundant, however, in honey, millet, panic-grass and 
pigs. If, however, by chance you cross it in summer, take care to guard 
your face from the enormous insects, commonly called guespe 
[wasps] or tauones [horseflies], which are most abundant there; and if 
you do not watch carefully where you put your feet, you will slip 
rapidly up to your knees in the quicksand that abounds there. ... 

After this valley is found the land of Navarre, which abounds in 
bread and wine, milk and cattle. The Navarrese and Basques are held 
to be exactly alike....This is a barbarous race unlike all other races in 
customs and in character, full of malice, swarthy in colour, evil of 
face, depraved, perverse, perfidious, empty of faith and corrupt, 
libidinous, drunken, experienced in all violence, ferocious and wild, 
dishonest and reprobate, impious and harsh, cruel and contentious, 
unversed in anything good, well-trained in all vices and iniquities. ...

eastern walls of the transepts and around the apse, provided 
multiple opportunities to display the relics that pilgrims had come 
to venerate (fig. 11 . 4 ). As pilgrims approached the nave from the 
west entrance and walked through the building, they were con¬ 
scious of marching step by step toward their goals in the apses, 
altars, and reliquaries at the east end of the church (fig. 11 . 5 ).

details, using the same pilgrimage plan, were built along the roads 
leading to Compostela. Major churches built to this plan are 
situated on each of the four main roads leading through France: 
Saint-Martin at Tours (on the road from Paris), Saint-Martial at 
Limoges (on the road from Vezelay), Sainte-Foy at Conques (on 


the road from Le Puy), and Saint-Sernin at Toulouse (on the road 
from Saint-Gilles-du-Gard). (See map 11.2.) 

The plan of Santiago de Compostela (see fig. 11.3) is 
composed of multiple modular units. It recalls the system of 
architectural composition based on additive components that was 
employed during the early Middle Ages (see page 333). The bays 
of the nave and the transept are half the size of the square cross¬ 
ing, and the square bays of the side aisles are in turn a quarter the 
size of the crossing and thus half the size of the nave bays. As at 
Sant Vinceng at Cardona (see fig. 11.1), the buildings elevation 
(see fig. 11.5) mirrors the clarity of its plan. The four colonnettes, 
small detached columns, of the compound piers reflect the build¬ 
ing s structural elements. However, overall there is less wall sur¬ 
face in the Santiago de Compostela nave, and colonnettes, used in 
place of Sant Vinceng s rectangular attachments to the compound 
piers (see pages 349-50), more richly articulate the nave elevation. 

So as not to weaken the barrel vaults at their springing, where 
they would need the most support, Santiago de Compostela was 
built without a clerestory. Since a vault becomes more difficult to 
sustain the farther it is from the ground, every resource had to be 
mined to enable the nave to be as tall as possible. The galleries 
built over the inner aisles counterbalance the lateral pressure of 
the nave vault. Inside the nave, vaults, arches, engaged colon¬ 
nettes, and pilasters are all firmly knit together into a coherent 
order that recaptures the vocabulary and syntax of ancient Roman 
architecture to a remarkable degree. Diffused light, subtle and 
atmospheric, filters into the nave through the side aisles and the 
galleries above. What function the galleries served is much 
debated. Conceivably they provided overflow space for the large 
numbers of pilgrims who visited the church, particularly on feast 
days, and indeed the famous Pilgrim's Guide , written around 
1130, mentions the presence of altars in the galleries. But the 
galleries also provide for an elegantly elaborated interior, as the 
Pilgrim's Guide also makes clear: 

In truth, in this church no fissure or fault is found; it is 
admirably constructed, grand, spacious, bright, of proper 
magnitude, harmonious in width, length and height, of 
admirable and ineffable workmanship, built in two storys, just 
like a royal palace. For indeed, whoever visits the naves of the 
gallery, if he goes up sad, after having seen the perfect beauty of 
this temple, he will be made happy and joyful.

The synthesis of emotional and spiritual response described in the 
Pilgrim's Guide results from the Romanesque builders’ ability to 
fuse structure and aesthetics. In another section of his book, the 
Guide's author notes with admiration the quality of the 
stonework, as “hard as marble.” By using a simile that compares 
the stone used to build the cathedral with the quintessential build¬ 
ing material of the Classical past, he clearly expresses a fact that

viewers today can still appreciate—that in both detail and execu¬ 
tion Santiago de Compostela emulates the nobility and dignity of 
Roman architecture. 

RELIQUARIES A twelfth-century casket, today in the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (fig. 11.6), is typical of 
the kinds of decorated reliquaries that pilgrims saw on their jour¬ 
neys to Compostela and Rome. This one was probably made in 
Limoges, a major stop on the road to Compostela and a center of 


enamel production, where there was a large church built accord¬ 
ing to the pilgrimage plan. The material and the bold areas of flat 
color, evident in both the foliage and the symbols of the four 
evangelists, relate this work to the tradition of migration and early 
medieval metalwork (see fig. 10.3). The method of manufacture is 
champleve, which was derived from the cloisonne technique (see 
page 315). Instead of cells formed from thin strips of metal 
attached to a support, as with cloisonne, the metal surface is 
gouged out to create compartments that contain the colored

reliquary and its lavish decoration suit its exceptional and holy 
contents, thought to be relics of St. Martial, identified by inscrip¬ 
tion on the other side of the box, since the reliquary comes from 
a church dedicated to him in Champagnat, about 60 miles (96 km) 
from Limoges. 

MONUMENTAL SCULPTURE Many of the churches along the 
pilgrimage route had elaborate sculptural programs decorating 
their interiors and portals. A series of large marble plaques, 
currently placed in the ambulatory of Saint-Sernin in Toulouse, 
located on the pilgrimage route that cuts across southern France 
(see map 11.2), dates to the years immediately preceding 1100. Six 
of these plaques depict angels and apostles, while one represents a 
seated Christ, the Christ in Majesty (fig. 11.7). Although their 
original location is not certain, the plaques most likely decorated 


the zone around the altar and shrine of St. Sernin, thus embellish¬ 
ing an area deemed particularly holy by pilgrims. 

The shallow relief and many decorative effects of the Christ 
plaque recall earlier metalwork and ivory objects (see figs. 10.16 
and 10.31). The extensive use of double lines, some creating raised 
sections, some impressed ones, enhances the figure s volumetric 
presence. The treatment also brings to mind manuscript illumina¬ 
tion, particularly Carolingian and Ottoman examples, but also 
Byzantine ones. In the arrangement of the figure, the play of 
linear drapery folds, and the variety of ornamental devices, we are 
not far from the Christ of the Godescalc Gospels (see fig. 10.12), 
which was in Saint-Sernin during the Middle Ages. 

The figure of Christ, somewhat more than half life-size, was 
not meant to be viewed exclusively at close range. Its impressive 
bulk and weight make it prominent even from a considerable dis¬ 
tance. This emphasis on volume hints at what may have been the 
main inspiration behind the revival of large-scale sculpture: A 
stone-carved image, being solid and three-dimensional, is far 
more “real” than a painted one. 

SECULAR STRUCTURES ALONG THE PILGRIMAGE ROAD 

A complex infrastructure was needed to service an enterprise as 
extensive as the pilgrimage to Compostela. Establishments such as 
hospices and hospitals provided for the needs of pilgrims. 
Improved roads and bridges were of particular importance, and a 
number of Spanish monarchs of the eleventh and twelfth cen¬ 
turies took their construction as essential goals, both to support 
pilgrims coming to Spain and to encourage closer relationships 
abroad, particularly with France. Such connections aimed to 
strengthen Christian foundations in Spain, a reaction to the 
Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula. Holy stature was often 
credited to people who built and maintained the actual roads on 
which pilgrims trekked, as was the case with Santo Domingo de 
la Calzada (literally “of the paved road” or “roadway”), who 
built, in addition to a pilgrims’ hostel and hospital, a long bridge 
over the Oja River and who maintained the roads around the 
town that came to be named after him. 

THE BRIDGE AT PUENTE LA REINA Almost a week before 
arriving in the town of Santo Domingo de la Calzada, pilgrims 
would have crossed a large, stately bridge in the town of Puente 
la Reina (fig. 11.8). The towns name derives from that mid¬ 
twelfth-century bridge (puente in Spanish), around which a settle¬ 
ment developed. Seven round-headed arches, only six of which 
survive today, formed the original bridge. The largest, central arch 
and the flanking arches, which decrease in span, fall on large pil¬ 
lars that are buttressed by wedge-shaped cutwaters, designed to 
break the current. Open arches fill the spandrels, the areas 
between the curves of two adjoining arches, and serve at once the 
physical function of lightening the weight of the bridge and the 
visual function of establishing, along with the arches of the bridge 
itself, a stepped rhythm that accentuates the structure s purpose to 
facilitate passage. The bridge is 350 feet long and nearly 10 feet 
wide, while its central arch spans 65 feet, a daring achievement for 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 355 











11.8 Bridge over the Arga River, Puente la Reina, Spain. 11th century 


the period and one that helps account for its fame. A little chapel 
in the center of the bridge was destroyed in the nineteenth 
century and around the same time towers at each end were razed, 
though one was reconstructed in the middle of the last century. 
The bridge was undoubtedly the result of royal patronage, as is 
reflected by its name (reina means queen in Spanish), although 
which queen commissioned it is an unresolved question. Even 
though crossing the bridge at Puente la Reina would have 
required payment of a toll, or a charge to cross it, the Pilgrim's 
Guide makes clear the benefits accrued from avoiding ferrymen, 
infamous for the exorbitant prices they charged as well as for 
their treachery: 

Upon leaving this country, the way of Saint James crosses two 
rivers which ... can not be crossed without a barque [boat]— 
may their boatmen be utterly damned! For, although the rivers 
are quite narrow, nevertheless, they are in the habit of getting 
one nummus [coin] from every person, poor as well as rich, 
whom they ferry across, and for a beast four, which they unde¬ 
servedly extort. ... When you get in, be careful not to fall into 
the water by accident. ... If the boat is overladen with too many 
people, it will soon be in peril. Many times also, after receiving 
the money, the ferrymen take on such a throng of pilgrims that 


the boat tips over, and the pilgrims are killed in the water. 
Thereupon the ferrymen rejoice wickedly after seizing the 
spoils from the dead.

Cluniac Architecture and Sculpture 

During the time when the sculptural decoration of Saint-Sernin 
was executed, the church was under the auspices of monks from 
the great Benedictine monastery of Cluny. Cluny was responsible 
for a network of dependencies; its “daughter” houses, spread 
across Europe, numbered more than 1,400, including a number of 
monasteries located on the pilgrimage road that served the needs 
of pilgrims. The Cluniac orders influence and growth were 
remarkable. The order could determine papal elections and call 
for crusades against the Muslims. The rise and spread of various 
monastic orders was significant for the development of 
Romanesque art, but none was more important than Cluny.

ABBEY CHURCH OF CLUNY The rapid growth of the 
Cluniac order can also be seen in the fact that its original basilica 
church of about 910 was replaced with a more ample one that 
itself was replaced only about 75 years later, in 1088, by the largest 
Romanesque church ever built, the third abbey church of Cluny 
(fig. 11 . 9 ). Unfortunately, Cluny III, as it is known, was 
destroyed after the French Revolution, and only the south 
transept (the one to the right in the plan) and the octagonal tower 
remain. The auspicious use of towers in Carolingian buildings 
such as Saint-Riquier (see fig. 10.20) here reached its culmination. 
The apsidioles, apses, and towers at the east end of Cluny created 
a monumental gathering of ever-higher forms. Individual ele¬ 
ments functioned together in built harmony (fig. 11.10); the south 
transept with octagonal tower at its crossing is on the left in this 
reconstruction.

from east (after Conant) 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 357 










































11.11 Reconstruction of abbey church of Cluny (Cluny III), 
nave and interior (after Conant) 


The proportions of Cluny III were based on ratios of 
“perfect” numbers and on musical harmonies, reminding us of the 
importance of music in the medieval Church. Monks chanted 
their prayers eight times a day and Gunzo, one of the architects of 
Cluny III, was noted for his musicianship. A benefit of stone- 
vaulted buildings was their acoustic resonance; this feature might 
well have encouraged the widespread use of stone vaulting or at 
least made the heavy financial investment acceptable to the com¬ 
munity. Even today, it is a moving experience to hear Gregorian 
chants sung beneath the vaults of a Romanesque church. 

The interior of Cluny III (fig. 11.11) was as elegant as it was 
huge, its vaults reaching 100 feet. Below the clerestory and in 
place of a gallery, was a triforium, the series of three-arched 
openings (one series per bay); the triforium, which is closed to the 
outside of the building, creates a space within the wall, barely 
sufficient to allow passage, that lightens it both physically and 
visually The clerestory and triforium are connected by pilaster 
strips with Corinthian capitals, reminiscent of Roman architec¬ 
tural decoration. What is not Roman is the use of slightly pointed 
arches in the nave arcade, a device thought to derive from contact 
with Islamic culture (see fig. 9.12). By eliminating the center part 
of the rounded arch, which responds the most to the pull of grav¬ 
ity, the two halves of a pointed arch brace each other. Because the 
pointed arch exerts less outward pressure than the semicircular 
arch, not only can it be made steeper, but the walls can be pierced 
(with windows and triforium arcades) and thus made lighter. 

MONASTERY OF MOISSAC The priory of Saint-Pierre at 
Moissac, located on the pilgrimage road close to Toulouse and 
also under the direction of Cluny, was another important center 
of Romanesque art. The cloister, adjacent to the church and

St. Bernard ofClairvaux 
(1090-1153) 

From Apologia to Abbot William ofSaint-Thierry 

Bernard ofClairvaux was a member of the Cistercians , an ascetic order 
founded in the eleventh century in opposition to the increasing opulence 
ofthe Benedictines. His letter to the Benedictine ahhot William ofSaint- 
Thierry of around 1127 denounces all monastic luxury\ especially the 
presence of art in cloisters. Like many others , Bernard believed that 
monks were spiritually superior to the “carnal” lay folk and so should 
not need material inducements to devotion. 

A s a monk, I put to monks the same question that a pagan used to 
criticize other pagans: “Tell me, priests,” he said, “what is gold 
doing in the holy place?” I, however, say ... “Tell me, poor men, if 
indeed you are poor men, what is gold doing in the holy place? ” For 
certainly bishops have one kind of business, and monks another. We 
[monks] know that since they [bishops] are responsible for both the 
wise and the foolish, they stimulate the devotion of a carnal people 
with material ornaments because they cannot do so with spiritual 
ones. But we who have withdrawn from the people, we who have left 
behind all that is precious and beautiful in this world for the sake of 
Christ, we who regard as dung all things shining in beauty, soothing 
in sound, agreeable in fragrance, sweet in taste, pleasant in touch—in 
short, all material pleasures— ... whose devotion, I ask, do we strive 
to excite in all this? ... 

Does not avarice, which is in the service of idols, cause all this? 
Money is sown with such skill that it may be multiplied. ... The very 
sight of these costly but wonderful illusions inflames men more to 


give than to pray. In this way wealth is derived from wealth. Eyes are 
fixed on relics covered with gold and purses are opened. The thor¬ 
oughly beautiful image of some male or female saint is exhibited and 
that saint is believed to be the more holy the more highly colored the 
image is. People rush to kiss it, they are invited to donate, and they 
admire the beautiful more than they venerate the sacred. ... What do 
you think is being sought in all this? The compunction of penitents, 
or the astonishment of those who gaze at it? O vanity of vanities! The 
Church is radiant in its walls and destitute in its poor. It serves the eyes 
of the rich at the expense of the poor. It dresses its stone in gold and it 
abandons its children naked. The curious find that which may delight 
them, but those in need do not find that which should sustain them. 

But apart from this, in the cloisters, before the eyes of the brothers 
while they read—what is that ridiculous monstrosity doing, an amaz¬ 
ing kind of deformed beauty and yet a beautiful deformity? What are 
the filthy apes doing there? The fierce lions? The monstrous cen¬ 
taurs? The creatures, part man and part beast? The striped tigers? The 
fighting soldiers? The hunters blowing horns? You may see many 
bodies under one head, and conversely many heads on one body. On 
one side the tail of a serpent is seen on a quadruped, on the other side 
the head of a quadruped is on the body of a fish. Over there an ani¬ 
mal has a horse for the front half and a goat for the back; here a crea¬ 
ture which is horned in front is equine behind. In short, everywhere 
so plentiful and astonishing a variety of contradictory forms is seen 
that one would rather read in the marble than in books, and spend the 
whole day wondering at every single one of them than in meditating 
on the law of God. Good God! If one is not ashamed of the absurd¬ 
ity, why is one not at least troubled at the expense?

Apologia and the Medieval Attitude Toward Art (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania 
Press, 1 990) 



reserved for the use of its monks, was formed by four covered 
passageways arranged around an open garden (fig. 11.12). 
Protected from the elements, the monks could practice their 
spiritual exercises here; they used the zone for a variety of other 
functions as well. The cloister was central to monastic life and 
physically occupied a central position within the monastic com¬ 
plex, as is seen in the St. Gall and Cluny plans. Seventy-six 
sculptured capitals decorate this private zone. While they include 
representations of Bible stories, many are decorated with foliage, 
birds, animals, and monstrous creatures. 

Although the Romanesque period is far removed chronologi¬ 
cally from the Early Christian aversion to image making, even 
during this period there were those who objected to the corrupt¬ 
ing power of visual representation. One of them was St. Bernard 
of Clairvaux, a member of the Cistercian order, a reform move¬ 
ment created around 1100 in part as a reaction to the increasing 
economic and political successes of Cluny and in order to provide 
a monastic life more in keeping with St. Benedict s rules (see pages 
330-31). In truth, it is hard to correlate the worldly achievements 
of a monastery such as that at Moissac or at Cluny—the wealth 
they acquired and the political clout they exercised—with the 
values to which monks traditionally aspired, which were based on 


the renunciation of earthly pleasures in favor of the pursuit of 
spiritual ideals. The pictorial representation of Christian themes 
was often justified by a famous saying: Quod legentihus scriptura , 
hoc idiotis ... pictura. Translated freely, this means that painting 
conveys the Word of God to the unlettered. Although St. Bernard 
did not object specifically to the teaching role of art, he had little 
use for church decoration and would surely have disapproved of 
the Moissac cloisters excesses, which were clearly meant to 
appeal to the eye as well as the spirit. In a letter of 1127 to Abbot 
William of Saint-Thierry concerning the decoration of churches, 
St. Bernard condemned art made for contemplation by monks. 
(See Primary Source, above.) 

If the Moissac monks had a profusion of sculpture to engage 
them, so too did pilgrims and layfolk visiting the monastery’s 
church. Its elaborately sculptured portal (fig. 11.13) was executed 
almost a generation after the cloister was finished. It displays the 
parts of a typical Romanesque portal (fig. 11 . 14 ). Christ in 
Majesty takes center stage in the tympanum, the lunette above 
the lintel of the portal. He is shown during his Second Coming, 
when he returns to Earth after the apocalyptic end of days, as 
described in the book of Revelation (4:1-8), in order to judge 
mortals as saved or damned. In accordance with the biblical

account, Christ is attended by four beasts, which accompany two 
angels and 24 elders, while wavy lines beneath their feet represent 
“the sea of glass like crystal.” The elders, relatively small com¬ 
pared with the other figures, and many of them gesticulating, can 
barely contain their excitement in the face of the remarkable 
vision. Abstraction and activity characterize the style of carving, 
in which quivering lines, borders of meandering ribbon patterns, 
and fluttering drapery offset a hierarchy of scale and pose. The 
use of abstraction in the service of religious zeal has parallels in 
earlier medieval art, for example the manuscript illuminations of 
the Ebbo Gospel Book (see fig. 10.14) and the Utrecht Psalter (see 
fig. 10.15). At Moissac, however, the presentation is on a monu¬ 
mental, public scale. 

Other parts of the Moissac portal are also treated sculpturally. 
Both the trumeau (the center post supporting the lintel) and the 
jambs (the sides of the doorway) have scalloped outlines (see fig. 
11.13), modeled on a popular Islamic device. By borrowing forms 
from the art of Islam at Moissac and other churches, Christians 
were expressing their admiration and regard for Arab artistic 
achievements. At the same time, such acts of appropriation could 
also express the Christian ambition to dominate the Muslim 
enemy. The pilgrimage to Santiago was a similar manifestation of 
anti-Islamic feeling. 

The scalloped outlines framing the doorway activate and 
dramatize the experience of entering the church. Human and 
animal forms are treated with flexibility. For instance, the spidery 
prophet on the side of the trumeau seems perfectly adapted to his 
precarious perch, even as he struggles to free himself from the 
stone (fig. 11 . 15 ). With legs crossed in a graceful movement, he 


turns his head toward the interior of the church as he unfurls his 
scroll. The crossed lions that form a symmetrical zigzag on the 
face of the trumeau “animate” the shaft the same way the interlac¬ 
ing beasts of Irish miniatures (from which they are descended) 
enliven the spaces they inhabit. 

We can trace the crossed lions through textiles to Persian 
metalwork, although not in this towerlike formation. Ultimately 
they descend from the heraldic animals of ancient Near Eastern 
art (see fig. 2.9). Yet we cannot account for their presence at 
Moissac in terms of their effectiveness as ornament alone. They 
belong to an extensive family of savage or monstrous creatures in 
Romanesque art that retain their demoniacal vitality even as they 
are forced to perform a supporting function. Their purpose is thus 
not only decorative but expressive; they embody dark forces that 
have been domesticated into guardian figures or banished to a 
position that holds them fixed for all eternity, however much they 
may snarl in protest. One medieval bishop argued that seeing 
animals sculpted in churches would so terrify parishioners that 
they would be encouraged to refrain from sinful deeds.

Moissac 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 361 

















































































11.16 East flank, south portal, church of Saint-Pierre, Moissac 

A deep porch with lavishly sculptured lateral ends frames the 
Moissac portal. Within an arcade on the east flank (fig. 11 . 16 ), we 
see, on the lower left, the Annunciation to the Virgin, and to the 
right, the Visitation (when Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth, 
mother of John the Baptist, to announce that she is pregnant), and 
the Adoration of the Magi in the top two panels under the arches. 
(The angel of the Annunciation is a modern replacement.) Other 
events from the early life of Jesus are on the frieze above. All of 
the figures have the same thin limbs and eloquent gestures as the 
prophet on the trumeau. On the west flank, not illustrated here, is 
a representation of the vice of luxuria (lust), presented as antithet¬ 
ical to the virtue of the Virgin Mary. The juxtaposition recalls the 
pairing during the early Middle Ages of Eve s sinfulness with 
Marys purity (see fig. 10.27). The messages at Moissac are 
patently didactic, meant both to command and to enlighten. 
When visitors on the pilgrim road faced the deep portal of the 
church they were virtually surrounded by the sculptural program, 
and this intensified the liminal experience of crossing into the 


church. The journey into the church became a veritable rite of 
passage, transformative both physically and spiritually. 

CATHEDRAL OF S Al N T-L AZ ARE, AUTUN Close to Cluny 
and dependent on it was the cathedral of Saint-Lazare at Autun. 
The tympanum of its west portal (fig. 11 . 17 ) represents the Last 
Judgment, the most awe-inspiring scene in Christian art. This 
scene depicts Christ after his Second Coming as he separates those 
who will be eternally saved from those who are damned. His 
figure, much larger than any other, dominates the tympanum. The 
sculptor, Gislebertus, whose signature appears immediately under 
the feet of Christ in the center of the tympanum, treats the sub¬ 
ject with extraordinary force. Gislebertus is only one of a number 
of Romanesque sculptors with distinct artistic personalities who 
are known to us by name. His style is sufficiently individual to 
enable scholars to posit convincingly that he trained at Cluny 
before his elevation to master s rank at Autun. 

On the left side of the tympanum, apostles observe the weigh¬ 
ing of souls, which takes place on the right side. Four angels in the 
corners sound the trumpets of the Apocalypse. At the bottom, the 
dead rise from their graves, trembling with fear; some are already 
beset by snakes or gripped by huge, clawlike hands. Above, their 
fate quite literally hangs in the balance, with devils yanking at one 
end of the scales and angels at the other. The saved souls cling like 
children to the angels for protection before their ascent to the 
heavenly Jerusalem (far left), while the condemned, seized by 
grinning devils, are cast into the mouth of Hell (far right). These 
nightmarish devils are human in general outline, but they have 
birdlike legs, furry thighs, tails, pointed ears, and savage mouths. 
The hierarchical, abstract, and patterned representation of Christ 
conveys his formidable power more effectively than any natural¬ 
istic image could. No visitor who had “read in the marble” (to 
quote St. Bernard of Clairvaux) could fail to enter the church in a 
chastened spirit. 

The Last Judgment, with its emphasis on retribution, was a 
standard subject for the tympana of Romanesque churches. It was 
probably chosen because some medieval justice was dispensed in 
front of the church portal, ante ecclesium. Thus, actual judicial 
proceedings paralleled the divine judgment represented here. 
Trial was by ordeal, whereby the accused established innocence 
only by withstanding grueling physical tests. The ordeals must, 
in reality, have been as terrifying as the scenes depicted on the 
tympanum. 

The outer archivolt (a molded band forming an arch) sur¬ 
rounding the west tympanum on Autun s cathedral is composed 
of medallions containing calendar scenes, comprised, in typical 
medieval fashion, of the signs of the zodiac and the corresponding 
labors of the months. The calendar serves to place the fearsome 
events of the Last Judgment within cosmological time, that is, 
within the physical realm that all of us occupy on earth. 

The north portal of the cathedral was dismantled in the eight¬ 
eenth century but Gislebertus s Eve (fig. 11.18), a fragment of the 
lintel, survives in the Musee Rolin. It demonstrates the master s

side of the lintel by a representation of Adam. Once again the 
choice of subjects undoubtedly relates to the portals liturgical 
function, since public penitential rites took place in front of the 
north portal. Adam and Eve s sin—the original one, after all—was 
mentioned in the penitential liturgy, in which sinners, seeking for¬ 
giveness for their transgressions, participated. In the relief, Eve s 
delicate gestures of grasping the fruit and touching her cheek as if 
in contemplation result in a beguiling, sensual silhouette. Her 
posture is not merely the consequence of the narrow horizontal 
space she occupies; rather, her pose emulates a slithering earth- 
bound serpent, so she is temptress as well as tempted. As we saw 
on the bronze doors of Bishop Bernward at Hildesheim (see fig. 
10.27), in medieval eyes Eve symbolized the base enchantments 
embodied by all worldly women. 

SARCOPHAGUS OF DONA SANCHA A different view of 
women can be seen in the stone sarcophagus created around 1120 
to house the remains of Doha Sancha, a princess of the kingdom 
of Aragon in northern Spain. Aragon had strong ties to Cluny; 
about 50 years before Sanchas sarcophagus was carved, her 
brother, King Sancho Ramirez, undertook a Cluniac reform of the 
monasteries in his kingdom. This was part of his efforts to 
strengthen Christian foundations in Spain, a reaction to the 
Muslim presence on the Iberian peninsula. 


At the center of one side of the sarcophagus (fig. 11.19), two 
angels support a nude figure in a mandorla, representing the soul 
of the deceased being lifted to Heaven, an appropriate subject for 
a funerary monument. On the left, three clerics under an arch per¬ 
form a Mass for the dead, and on the right, two women, probably 
Sanchas sisters, stand under an arch and flank the enthroned 
princess. The arrangement in this right panel, which proclaims the 
dignity and importance of the larger central figure of Sancha, 
relies on an antique tradition, seen, for example, on the fourth- 
century Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (see fig. 8.20). 

On the other side of the sarcophagus are three mounted fig¬ 
ures, each under an arch. Two armed horsemen confront each 
other, while the third straddles a lion and grasps its open jaws 
with his hands. The most compelling interpretation of the con¬ 
fronted horsemen identifies them as combatants in the struggle 
between good and evil, a common subject in Christian art. The 
lion rider in the right arcade has variously been identified as the 
long-haired Samson or the youthful David, both Hebrew Bible 
prototypes for the Christian struggle against evil. 

Sancha was a key figure in her kingdom at a time when the 
Aragonese kings were fighting to conquer Spain from the 
Muslims, who then held sway over much of the Iberian peninsula. 
That scenes of battle, even ones that can be symbolically or 
allegorically interpreted, were considered appropriate for the

sarcophagus of a woman is a mark of the culture of Romanesque 
Spain, which one scholar has called “a society organized for war. ” 
Many legends sprang up about womens roles in the defense of 
territories newly conquered from Muslims by Christian warriors. 
The pressing need for settlement and permanent organization 
required women to engage actively in the acquisition and 
exchange of land and other properties at a time when their men 
were away on military campaigns. If Sancha were an isolated 
instance of a woman of power enjoying special prestige, it would 
not add much to our knowledge of the Romanesque period. But, 
in fact, women in eleventh- and twelfth-century Spain played an 
inordinately important role in the formation of political struc¬ 
tures, and as commissioners of works of art. 

The triumphal aspirations represented on Sancha s sarcopha¬ 
gus are balanced by the sensitive depiction of the soul, whose ten¬ 
der expression suggests hope as well as anxiety, common human 
responses when contemplating death. Notice how the center 
group is the only one not covered by an arch, a strategy that 
emphasizes a sense of upward thrust and hence suggests a 
heavenly journey. 


Cluniac Wall Painting 

Because the destruction of Cluny s buildings resulted in the loss 
of its wall paintings, we can best appreciate what these might have 
looked like by examining allied monuments. A good one for this 
purpose is the priory of Berze-la-Ville. 

THE BERZE-LA-VILLE APSE The early twelfth-century pri¬ 
ory of Berze-la-Ville, just a few miles southeast of Cluny, was 
built as a retreat for Cluny s abbot, and the apse paintings in its 
chapel (fig. 11.20) emulate those in the church of the mother 
house. Christ in Majesty occupies the center of the composition, 
surrounded by the apostles. The elongated faces and the graceful 
manner in which drapery is pulled across limbs impart delicacy 
and elegance to the images; patterns of rhythmic concentric lines 
and bright highlights indicate the multiple folds in the cloth. 
Although these devices ultimately derive from Byzantine 
sources, such as the Paris Psalter (see fig. 8.39), the path by which 
they were acquired was indirect, coming from Byzantine art in 
Italy, not Constantinople. The library at Cluny was rich in 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 365 













11.20 Christ and Apostles, 
priory of Berze-la-Ville, 
France. Early 12th century 



Italo-Byzantine manuscripts, and Cluniac manuscript illumina¬ 
tion also favors this style. 

Cistercian Architecture and Art 

As we have seen, Cluny s very success made it the subject of 
criticism, particularly by the Cistercians, whose mother house 
was at Citeaux in Burgundy. In addition to prayer, the Cistercians 
devoted themselves to hard work, which helped guarantee their 
own great success. Sound economic planning, skill in agriculture 
and husbandry, and wealthy benefactors furthered their cause. At 
a time of rising urban growth, the serenity of the isolated sites of 
their monasteries must also have been attractive. The Cistercian 
order and its style spread across Europe, and by the end of the 
twelfth century the Cistercians controlled nearly 700 monasteries. 
Cistercian architecture in its simplicity contrasts markedly with 
the architecture of the Cluniac order. 

ABBEY CHURCH AT FONTENAY The abbey church at 
Fontenay, not far from Citeaux, was begun in 1139, a generation 
after St. Bernard founded a monastery there. It is the best- 
preserved Cistercian church built in the first half of the twelfth 
century. Fontenay exemplifies the Cistercian reliance on simple 
and unadorned forms in contrast to the opulence promulgated 
by Cluny In its orderliness, the plan of simple geometric shapes 
(fig. 11.21) builds on monastic schemes dating as far back as 


the St. Gall drawing (see fig. 10.22). By comparison to the 
expansive plan of Cluny (see fig. 11.9), where the huge abbey 
church dominated a sprawling complex, Fontenay is precise, a 
pure and tightly controlled equilibrium balancing all of its 
constituent parts.

11.22 Nave of the abbey church, Fontenay. 1139-47 


The east end of the church is unembellished by apses, and no 
towers were planned. Since Cistercians permitted neither sculp¬ 
ture nor wall painting, the interior of the church (fig. 11.22) lacks 
applied decoration. Clerestory and gallery are suppressed. 
However, in their own terms, the clean lines of the pointed trans¬ 
verse arches that define the nave and openings into the side aisles, 
and the pattern of unframed windows, create an elegant refine¬ 
ment. The simple forms are at once graceful and moving. Once 
again, the church serves as a safe, tranquil, and spiritual refuge 
from worldly burdens, although different in effect from the 
protective enclosures that other Romanesque churches offer (see 
figs. 11.1 and 11.5). 


Other Benedictine Architecture 
and Wall Painting 

The Benedictine abbey church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe is of 
a type known as a hall church (fig. 11.23). The nave vault lacks 
transverse arches, since its weight rests directly on the nave 
arcade, which is supported by a majestic set of columns. The nave 
is fairly well lit, for the two aisles are carried almost to the same 
height as the nave, and their outer walls have generous windows. 

Although Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe has a luxurious sculp¬ 
tural program and a rich doorway, the hall church was designed 
particularly to offer a continuous surface for murals. The Building 
of the Tower of Babel (fig. 11.24) is part of an extensive cycle of 
scenes from the Hebrew Bible on the vault. It is an intensely 
dramatic design, crowded with strenuous action. God himself, on 
the far left, participates directly in the narrative, addressing the

Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, France

builders of the huge structure. He is counterbalanced, on the 
right, by the giant Nimrod, leader of the project, who frantically 
hands blocks of stone to the masons atop the tower. The entire 
scene becomes a great test of strength between God and mortals. 
The heavy, dark contours and the emphatic gestures make the 
composition easy to read from the floor below. Elsewhere in the 
church the viewer can see Christian biblical scenes and scenes 
from the lives of local saints. Although paintings in Romanesque 
churches were not necessarily the norm, they were common 
features. Many frescoes no longer exist as a result of restoration 
programs. (See The Art Historian's Lens , page 369.) 


Book Illustration 

As in the early Middle Ages, manuscript production in the 
Romanesque period continued to be largely the responsibility of 
monastic scriptoria under the supervision of monks. Manuscripts 
produced by Cluniac scriptoria are stylistically similar to wall 
paintings in Cluniac churches and often express concerns remark¬ 
ably akin to those of the period s architects and sculptors. Those

Preserving and Restoring Architecture 


T he conservation and the preservation of any work of art are deli¬ 
cate tasks. In the case of architecture, the issues to be considered 
are particularly acute since, in addition to aesthetic criteria, restorers 
must take into account a building’s function. What does one do, for 
example, with a building originally built to satisfy functions that are no 
longer relevant? Such is the question with medieval castles and 
palaces, as well as with churches located in areas where population 
shifts have reduced the size of their parishes. Should these buildings 
be retrofitted for new uses, even if that transforms their original 
character? 

The restoration of Romanesque buildings poses some special prob¬ 
lems. In many regions of Europe, virtually every village has its own 
Romanesque church, but diocesan and governmental institutions have 
difficulty in obtaining the funds to preserve them. Moreover, 
Romanesque architecture is characterized by its great variety. Thus, a 
one-size-fits-all approach to restoration, which might be efficient on a 
practical level, only erases the essential distinctions that give the 
Romanesque its exceptional quality. 

Art historian C. Edson Armi has written penetratingly about recent 
restorations of Romanesque churches in the Burgundy region of 
France.* Although the French Restoration Service has a long tradition 
of intervening to save historic buildings, it does not have the resources 
to maintain all needy monuments. Increasingly, it has had to focus on 
simply reacting to severe problems, often when it is too late to correct 
them. Additionally, the service has a pattern of applying a universal, 
rather than a specific, approach to the restoration of buildings. In the 
mid-twentieth century, it was fashionable to clean the surfaces of 
Romanesque churches within an inch of their lives, and restorers indis¬ 
criminately removed any surface coverings—sometimes including 
original ones—to expose underlying stone or brick. It was thought that 
by exposing the original materials and structure, the building’s true 
expressive nature would be revealed. 

By late in the twentieth century, the pendulum had swung the other 
way, and the norm was to plaster both interior and exterior surfaces 
of Romanesque churches—in some cases, the same ones that had 
been completely stripped only a generation or so earlier. While it is 


true that during the Middle Ages the surfaces of buildings, whether of 
brick or stone, were often covered with plaster, this was not always the 
case. Armi demonstrates how recent interventions have covered up 
valuable evidence of original materials and structure, information that 
would help an architectural historian “appreciate large issues like the 
concept, process and history of a building.” Since Armi has shown that 
a mason’s techniques are as distinctive as a painter’s or a sculptor’s, 
the lost information could well be key to placing a building in its art 
historical context. Armi proposes early preservation programs to pre¬ 
vent the need for severe reconstructions that are often based more on 
conjecture than on fact. Before undertaking any project, he would 
require modern restorers to acquire a sound understanding of the his¬ 
torical and architectural situation of individual buildings and regions. 
He proposes that review committees participate in decisions about the 
restoration of important buildings. Armi has been guided by standards 
established at the 1 964 Venice International Congress of Architects 
and Technicians of Historic Monuments, which require that whatever 
is done to a building must demonstrate “respect for original material 
and authentic documents ... and must stop at the point where conjec¬ 
ture begins.” Any restorations “must be distinguishable from the 
original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic 
evidence.” We also need to ask to what extent one should accept or 
reject previous changes to buildings. Is it always important to get back 
to the hypothetical origin of a building, or is it appropriate to consider 
buildings as entities that change over time? Is there an ideal moment 
that restorers should aim to preserve? When is it proper to remove a 
later addition to a building and when should that addition be 
preserved? A case in point is the Early Christian basilica of Santa Maria 
Maggiore (see page 250). The original fifth-century apse was 
destroyed when a new one was added in 1 290; during the next 
35 years, leading artists of the day decorated it with magnificent 
mosaics. Certainly, in this case, to restore the building to its fifth- 
century state would produce a loss much greater than any advantage 
obtained byre-creating original forms.

produced in Cistercian scriptoria are particularly inventive, often 
based on the observation of daily life. Many manuscripts pro¬ 
duced at Citeaux show strong English influence, and some were 
perhaps executed by English illuminators. Although a great vari¬ 
ety of styles characterize Romanesque manuscripts, the interrela¬ 
tionship of monastic communities accounts for some consistency 
in manuscript production across various regions during the 
period. Some manuscripts produced in northern France, Belgium, 
and southern England are so closely related in style that at times 
we cannot be sure on which side of the English Channel a given 
manuscript was produced. 

THE CLUNY LECTION ARY Pentecost (fig. 11.25), an illumina¬ 
tion from the Cluny Lectionary , represents the descent of the 


Holy Spirit on the apostles after the Resurrection of Christ. As 
in the apse fresco at Berze-la-Ville (see fig. 11.20), a viewer sees 
highlighted drapery tautly drawn across limbs. Other stylistic fea¬ 
tures also recall Byzantine devices. The delicate, classicizing faces 
of some of the prophets evoke Middle Byzantine painting (see 
figs. 8.38 and 8.39), and the other faces with long mustaches 
falling over ample beards recall the Byzantine manner of repre¬ 
senting saints and prophets (see fig. 8.40). Even Christ at the top 
of the folio is presented in his typical Byzantine role as 
Pantocrator. The apostle distinguished by his central placement is 
Peter, the same saint who receives the scroll from Christ in the 
Berze-la-Ville apse painting. Since Cluny was dedicated to St. 
Peter, it was only logical to stress his importance, but there is a 
political message here as well. Cluny s foundation charter states 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 369 


STORI AN ’ 





that the monastery was answerable only to Rome and the pope, 
heir to Peter s throne, and not to any king or emperor. This 
special privilege assured Cluny enormous power and ultimately 
its success too. 

THE CODEX COLBERTINUS The illustration of St. Matthew 
from the Codex Colbertinus (fig. 11.26) is similar in concept and

pose to a number of Romanesque carvings, particularly the pier 
reliefs from the Moissac cloister (see fig. 11.12). The manuscript 
was made at that monastery, or nearby, just when sculptors were 
at work in the cloister. Matthew appears at the beginning of his 
Gospel, next to an embellished letter “L,” the first letter of Liber , 
meaning “book.” Figures, animals, foliage, and decorative pat¬ 
terns conform to the shape of the letter, recalling the way 
Romanesque sculptured figures correspond to their frames (see 
fig. 11.2). 

In contrast to the small, freely disposed figures and animals in 
the initial, the figure of Matthew confronts us directly. Although 
he fills the available space of the architectural setting, a number of 
features deny his solidity. The heavy outlines and bold colors are 


370 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 









































reminiscent of enamelwork (see fig. 11.6) and, in combination 
with a variety of juxtaposed patterns, serve to flatten the image. 
These devices demonstrate to what extent forms popular during 
the early Middle Ages remained vital. 

THE CORBIE GOSPEL BOOK In its monumentality, the 
image of St. Mark from an early twelfth-century Gospel book 
produced at Corbie (fig. 11.27) can also be likened to 
Romanesque sculpture. The active pose and zigzag composition 
bear comparison with the prophet on the Moissac trumeau (see 
fig. 11.15). The twisting movement of the lines, not only in the 
figure of St. Mark but also in the winged lion, the scroll, and the 
curtain, also recalls Carolingian miniatures of the Reims School, 
such as the Ebbo Gospel Book (see fig. 10.14). 

This resemblance helps us see the differences between them as 
well. In the Romanesque manuscript, every trace of classical 
illusionism has disappeared. The fluid modeling of the Reims 
School, with its suggestion of light and space, has been replaced 
here by firm contours filled in with bright, solid colors. As a 
result, the three-dimensional aspects of the picture are reduced 
to overlapping planes. Yet by sacrificing the last remnants of 
modeling in terms of light and shade, the Romanesque artist has 
given his work a clarity and precision that had not been possible 
in Carolingian or Ottoman times. Here, the representational, the 
symbolic, and the decorative elements of the design are fully 
integrated. 

GREGORY’S MORALIA IN JOB Although in principle, 
given the concern about elaborate decoration by St. Bernard and 
others, Cistercian manuscripts were to be decorated only with 
nonfigurative initials of single colors, in actuality a number of 
beautiful and fascinating manuscripts were produced for the 
order. It is not easy to explain why an exception was made for 
this genre of art. It might simply have been because official 
statutes against the decoration of manuscripts were not estab¬ 
lished until 1134. (Some scholars claim these statutes date from 
1152.) Pope Gregorys Moralia in Job , produced in 1111 at 
Citeaux, is a charming example (fig. 11.28). The manuscript 
contains decorated initials, depicting some of the monastery’s 
daily activities, including the initial “I,” formed by a tree, which 
a lay brother and a monk work together to fell. The bright, flat 
colors and patterned foliage of the tree contrast with seemingly 
naturalistic details. The monks garment, his bunched trousers, 
and the dagger suspended on his belt convey the workaday qual¬ 
ity of monastic life. The scene correlates with the accompanying 
text and reflects Cistercian monastic values. The monk depicted 
here is engaged in hard manual labor, as required by the 
Benedictine Rule. His tattered garments highlight the Cistercians’ 
humility and their avoidance of luxury, a reaction to the perceived 
perversion of Benedictine values by other monks, including those 
at Cluny. In the second half of the twelfth century, with few 
exceptions, Cistercian manuscripts received only very simple 
decorations, apparently as a result of the statutes prohibiting 
elaborate adornments.

GOSPEL BOOK OF ABBOT WEDRICUS The style of the 
miniature of St. John from the Gospel Book of Abbot Wedricus 
(fig. 11.29) has been linked with both northern France and 
England, and its linear draftsmanship was influenced by 
Byzantine art. Note the ropelike loops of drapery, the origin of 
which can be traced to such works as the Crucifixion at Daphni 
(see fig. 8.45) and, even further back, to the Archangel Michael 
ivory (see fig. 8.33). At the same time, the energetic rhythm

unifying the composition in the Corbie style (see fig. 11.27) has 
not been lost entirely. The controlled dynamics of every contour, 
both in the main figure and in the frame, unite the varied elements 
of the composition. This quality of line betrays its ultimate 
source: the Celtic-Germanic heritage. 

If we compare the Abbot Wedricus miniature of St. John with 
the Cross page of the Lindisfarne Gospels (see fig. 10.5), we see 
how much the interlacing patterns of the early Middle Ages have 
contributed to the design of the St. John page. The drapery folds 
and the clusters of floral ornament have an impulsive yet disci¬ 
plined liveliness that echoes the intertwined snakelike monsters of 
the animal style (even though the foliage is derived from the clas¬ 
sical acanthus), and the human figures are based on Carolingian 
and Byzantine models. The unity of the page is conveyed not only 
by the forms but by the content as well. St. John inhabits the 


frame so thoroughly that we could not remove him from it with¬ 
out cutting off his ink supply (offered by the donor of the manu¬ 
script, Abbot Wedricus), his source of inspiration (the dove of the 
Holy Spirit in the hand of God), or his symbol (the eagle), all 
located in medallions on the page borders. The other medallions, 
less closely linked with the main figure, show scenes from the life 
of St. John. 

OTHER REGIONAL VARIANTS 
OF ROMANESQUE STYLE 

Although consistent aesthetic aims expressed across mediums link 
the art of diverse areas of Europe during the Romanesque period, 
a variety of regional approaches can also be identified. These 
distinct approaches appear in regions of what is now France as 
well as in other parts of Europe, such as Tuscany in Italy, the 
Meuse Valley, Germany, and England. Regional variety in 
Romanesque art reflects the political conditions of eleventh- and 
twelfth-century western Europe, which was governed by a feudal, 
though loose, alliance of princes and dukes. Language differences 
also help account for regional diversity. For example, even within 
France a number of languages were spoken, among them the 
langue d’oc , the language of southwestern France, and the langue 
d’oif the language of the center and north. Different regions had 
different artistic sources available to artists and patrons. In 
Germany and other parts of northern Europe, Ottoman art pro¬ 
vided compelling models, while in Italy and southern France, 
where antique survivals were numerous, artists borrowed and 
transformed Roman forms in order to realize Romanesque 
aesthetic aims. In England, which through conquest had become 
the domain of Norman dukes in 1066, the artwork of French 
Normandy provided models. 

Western France: Poitou 

A so-called school of sculptural decoration appears during the 
Romanesque period in the region known as Poitou, part of the 
duchy of Aquitaine in southwestern France. A notable example is 
Notre-Dame-la-Grande in Poitiers, seat of the lords of Aquitaine. 

NOTRE-DAME-LA-GRANDE, POITIERS The broad screen¬ 
like faqade of Notre-Dame-la-Grande (fig. 11.30) offers an 
expanded field for sculptural decoration. Elaborately bordered 
arcades house large seated or standing figures. Below them, a wide 
band of relief carving stretches across the faqade. The Fall of 
Adam and Eve appears with scenes from the life of Mary, includ¬ 
ing the Annunciation and Nativity, once again juxtaposing Eve 
and Mary (see pages 344 and 362). Next to the representation of 
Adam and Eve, an inscription identifies an enthroned figure as 
Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon mentioned in the Hebrew 
Bible. The Play of Adam —a twelfth-century medieval drama of a 
type that was traditionally performed in churches—probably 
served as the source for the choice and arrangement of figures at

Notre-Dame-la-Grande. Beside Nebuchadnezzar, centered above 
the arch on the left of the portal, there are four figures carrying 
either scrolls or books on which are inscribed lines from the 
Adam play, in which Adam and Eve figure prominently and 
Nebuchadnezzar is also mentioned. 

Essential to the rich sculptural effect is the deeply recessed 
doorway without tympanum but framed by a series of arches 
with multiple archivolts. The conical helmets of the towers nearly 
match the height of the gable (the triangular wall section at the 
top of the facade), which rises above the actual level of the roof 
behind it. The gable contains a representation of Christ with 
angels, their height in the composition denoting their heavenly 
place. The sculptural program spread out over this entire area is a 
visual exposition of Christian doctrine intended as a feast for the 
eyes as well as the mind. 


Southeastern France: Provence 

In the French region of Provence, south of Burgundy 
Romanesque art benefitted from its proximity to Italy The name 
Provence derives from its ancient designation as a provincia romana 
in recognition of its close political and cultural connections to 
Rome; even today vestiges of Roman art and architecture abound 
in the region, such as the Maison Carree in Nimes (see fig. 7.44). 

SAINT-GILLES-DU-GARD The facade of the abbey church of 
Saint-Gilles-du-Gard (fig. 11.31), like Notre-Dame-la-Grande in 
Poitiers, screens the church. Both churches were major stops on

the pilgrimage road to Santiago de Compostela (see map 11.2). 
The facade of Saint-Gilles has suffered some later rearrangements 
and the original probably displayed a more consistent horizontal- 
ity, with continuous friezes, lintels, cornices, and bases, instead of 
the staggered ones that we see today. Scholars have claimed that 
inspiration for Saint-Gilles-du-Gard s facade, composed of three 
arches, can be found in the screenlike stage sets (see fig. 7.7) of 
Roman theaters and in the Roman triumphal arch (see fig. 7.71), 
connecting ancient triumphal imagery with the important liminal 
function of entering the church. Given contemporary concerns 
for Christian victory, in particular the struggle to conquer the 
Muslims, the formal association between the facade and a Roman 
triumphal monument must have seemed particularly fitting here, 
since the town of Saint-Gilles on the Rhone River estuary was a 
principal site of embarkation for the Holy Land by French cru¬ 
saders led by the counts of Toulouse, among whose possessions 
Saint-Gilles-du-Gard figured. Moreover, the military orders of 
the Knights of the Temple (the Templars), and the Knights of 
St. John of Jerusalem (the Hospitalers), which were founded to 
protect pilgrimage routes and sites in the Holy Land, had their 
primary commanderies (districts or estates administered by a 
commander of an order of knights) in the West at Saint-Gilles. 
The depiction of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, which 
appears on the lintel supporting the left tympanum, would 
undoubtedly have had special meaning for contemporary viewers. 

The Holy Land 

Many consider the Holy Land a virtual French province during 
much of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, largely as a result of 
crusader activity there. The history of the Crusades is a complex 
one and the motives of crusaders diverse. Some went for what one 
early twelfth-century priest described as “superficial reasons,” 
that is, for the excitement of foreign travel and for financial gain, 
while others undertook it as a form of penance or out of deeply 
felt religious piety, seeking to free the places where Christ lived, 
taught, and died from the Muslims who had occupied them. The 
First Crusade, mobilized by Pope Urban II in 1095, managed to 
claim Jerusalem after three years, but later crusades were gener¬ 
ally disastrous. The Second Crusade (1147-49), which was 
preached by St. Bernard of Clairvaux after the fall of Edessa to the 
Turks, succeeded only in capturing Lisbon from the Arabs, while 
the Third Crusade, begun in 1189, failed to reconquer Jerusalem 
from the sultan Saladin, who had taken it two years earlier. 
The Fourth (and final major) Crusade did little to hinder the 
advance of Islam; its sole result was the taking of Constantinople 
by crusaders in 1204, one of the most ignominious events in 
church history. 

CRAC DES CHEVALIERS To defend territories conquered 
during the First Crusade, French crusaders erected a significant 
number of castles in the Holy Land. Among the best-preserved of 
these is in northern Syria, the Crac des Chevaliers (the name 
derives from the Syrian word for fortress and the French word for 


knight) (fig. 11.32). The Crac des Chevaliers guards the Homs 
Pass, an important commercial corridor, and rises more than 2,000 
feet above the fertile pastures of the Orantes Valley. In 1110, the 
Franks, under Raymond IV of Saint-Gilles, count of Toulouse 
and subsequently count of Tripoli, occupied the site of what had 
been a small eleventh-century Arab fort, which was then rebuilt 
and expanded, and later, in 1142, given to the Hospitalers. The 
castle sits on a natural outcrop of rock, whose sharp drop 
protected it on the north, east, and west. The first Christian castle 
took the form of a trapezoidal precinct enclosed by curtain walls 
with salient (projecting) rectangular towers. These towers were 
later converted to rounded ones because they provided better 
sight lines for defense in time of siege; and an outer enclosure, also 
composed of curtain walls and rounded projections, in some 
places more than 25 feet thick, was added. Much of this happened 
as a result of major earthquake damage in 1170. Battered (sloping) 
walls, difficult to scale, were added to the inner precinct. Defenses 
also included slits for archers and crenelations, notched 
battlements at the top of the walls that shielded warriors while 
allowing them to release their weapons. Projecting from the walls 
are machicolations, providing an enclosed area supported by a 
row of arches and containing openings through which soldiers 
could drop rocks on attackers. An aqueduct brought water from 
the summit of a nearby mountain, filling cisterns and a reservoir 
built between the inner and outer walls that also served as a 
defense. It has been estimated that in time of siege the Crac would 
have been able to stock provisions for five years. 

While a major function of the Crac des Chevaliers was clearly 
defense, it also served as a point of departure for incursions into 
neighboring territory and to establish control over the large 
fertile valley below and the trade routes that crossed it. Castles 
were the center of authority over the local population: in the case 
of the Crac, a largely Muslim one. The castle proclaimed the rite 
of rule of the overlord and as such upheld the structure of feudal 
society and the relationship between lord and vassal. Castles were 
viewed as symbols of power, and in the later Middle Ages archi¬ 
tectural features such as crenelations, that had been developed for 
defensive purposes were applied to palaces where their original 
function was no longer required. 

While some scholars have seen the Crac des Chevaliers and 
other crusader castles in the Holy Land as providing the oppor¬ 
tunity for military engineers to invent and develop new systems 
of defense, particularly against siege warfare, which were then 
exported to western Europe, others have stressed the possibility 
that crusaders were influenced by Muslim and Byzantine castles, 
both of which they would have encountered in the Holy Land. 
Building activity by the crusaders was not limited to defensive 
structures, however. Indeed, a number of Romanesque churches, 
many of them pilgrimage sites, such as the Holy Sepulcher in 
Jerusalem (see fig. 8.12) and a church dedicated to the Nativity in 
Bethlehem, were built or reconstructed during the period, and these 
buildings, like the Crac des Chevaliers, provide evidence of a 
continued syncretism in the region. Romanesque castles share 
the same aesthetic concerns as Romanesque churches and other

buildings, and use the same system of solid stone walls, arches, 
and vaults. The rhythmic arrangement of curved and straight 
walls and the repeated patterns of wall openings suggest that 
similar concerns for design and proportionality were at play. 

In 1271, the Crac des Chevaliers fell to the Muslims, and the 
chapel, which the Christians had erected within the inner 
precinct, was converted into a mosque. At the same time, the 
southern square tower, visible at the right of figure 11.32, and the 
round projection to the left of the aqueduct were reconstructed, 
since it was from the less easily defensible south that the Muslims 
had attacked. 

Tuscany 

During the Romanesque period, Tuscany, a region in northwest¬ 
ern Italy divided into several independent city-states, the chief of 
which were Pisa, Florence, Prato, and Livorno, continued to 
deploy what were basically Early Christian architectural forms. 
However, they added decorative features inspired by Roman 
architecture. 

PISA CATHEDRAL The most famous monument of the Italian 
Romanesque owes its fame to an accident. Because of poor foun¬ 
dations, the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Tuscany designed by the 
sculptor Bonanno Pisano (active 1174-86), began to tilt even 


before it was completed (fig. 11.33). This type of free-standing 
tower, or campanile, appears in Italy as early as the ninth or tenth 
century The tradition of the detached campanile remained so 
strong in Italy that towers hardly ever became an integral part of 
the church itself. The complex at Pisa includes a church and a 
circular, domed baptistery to the west. The ensemble of buildings, 
built on an open site north of the city reflects the wealth and 
pride of the city-republic of Pisa after its naval victory over the 
Muslims at Palermo in 1062. 

The Pisa baptistery was begun in 1153 by Diotisalvi but every¬ 
thing above the arcaded first level was reworked a century later. 
Throughout the Middle Ages, Tuscany remained conscious of its 
antique heritage. The idea of a separate baptistery relies on Early 
Christian precedents. The round form of the Pisa one and its orig¬ 
inal cone vault also reflect the structure of the Rotunda of the 
Anastasis in Jerusalem (see fig. 8.12). The comparison would 
undoubtedly have been comprehensible to Pisans, whose seamen 
profited by carrying pilgrims and crusaders to the Holy Land. 
Once again, the opportunity for increased trade and travel, the 
lure of pilgrimage, and the ongoing struggle against the Muslims 
in Iberia and the eastern Mediterranean were decisive forces in 
shaping Romanesque monuments. 

The basic plan of Pisa cathedral is that of an Early Christian 
basilica, but it has been transformed into a Latin cross (where 
three arms are of equal length and one is longer) by the addition 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 375 








11.33 Baptistery, cathedral, and campanile (view from the west), 
Pisa, Italy. 1053-1272 


of transept arms that resemble small basilicas with apses of 
their own. A dome marks the crossing. The rest of the church has 
a wooden roof, except for the aisles (four in the nave, two in 
the transept arms), which have groin vaults, formed when two 
barrel vaults intersect. The interior (fig. 11.34) has somewhat 
taller proportions than an Early Christian basilica, because 
there are galleries over the aisles as well as a clerestory. Yet the 
classical columns supporting the nave and aisle arcades still recall 
types that would fit comfortably in an Early Christian basilica 
(see fig. 8.9). 

A deliberate revival of the antique Roman style in Tuscan 
architecture was the use of a multicolored marble “skin” on the 
exteriors of churches. Little of this inlay is left today on the 
ancient monuments of Rome because much of it was literally 
“lifted” to decorate later buildings. However, the interior of the 


11.34 Interior, Pisa cathedral 



376 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 









































Pantheon still gives us some idea of what this must have looked 
like. Pisa cathedral and its companion buildings are covered in 
white marble inlaid with horizontal stripes and ornamental pat¬ 
terns in dark-green marble. This decorative scheme is combined 
with blind arcades and galleries. The result is a richness very 
different from austere Early Christian exteriors. 

BAPTISTERY OF SAN GIOVANNI, FLORENCE In 

Florence, which was to outstrip Pisa commercially and artisti¬ 
cally, the greatest achievement of the Tuscan Romanesque is the 
baptistery of San Giovanni (fig. 11.35) opposite the cathedral (see 
fig. 13.10). It is a domed, octagonal building of impressive size, 
begun in the middle of the eleventh century. The eight sides of the 
building continue a long tradition in baptistery design and sym¬ 
bolically allude to rebirth: The world began on the eighth day 


following the Creation, and Christ was resurrected on the eighth 
day of the Passion. The green-and-white marble paneling is typi¬ 
cal of the Florentine Romanesque in its severely geometric lines. 
The triple arches of the second-story blind arcades, with their 
triumphal-arch design, are extraordinarily classical in proportion 
and detail. 

SAN MINIATO AL MONTE, FLORENCE The magnificent 
site of the Benedictine monastery of San Miniato al Monte over¬ 
looking the city of Florence reflects that establishment s grandeur 
during the Middle Ages. The church is dedicated to St. Minias, 
Florence s first Christian martyr, a third-century hermit who was 
beheaded by the Romans. It is said that, after his martyrdom, 
St. Minias gathered his head and proceeded to the cave where he 
had lived and died; subsequently a church was built on site. The

gabled facade of the church (fig. 11 . 36 ) coincides with the shape 
of the wooden-roofed and aisled basilica. As with the baptistery 
of San Giovanni, and begun only a few years after it, geometric 
precision governs the arrangement of the facades green-and- 
white marble covering. Although the treatment of surface and 
the materials employed are distinctive to Tuscany, the organiza¬ 
tion of elements compares with Romanesque arrangements else¬ 
where. The individual, additive units decorating Florentine 
Romanesque buildings also parallel the compartmentalized bays 
in pilgrimage churches (see fig. 11.5) and the way French 
Romanesque portals (see figs. 11.13, 11.30, 11.31) are composed 
of individual units that maintain their identities though function¬ 
ing in unison. Roman elements employed in conscious revival— 
here the use of marble and the repeated arches that rest on 
columns topped with Corinthian capitals—unite many of these 
Romanesque works as well. 


Germany 

In Germany, the traditions of the Fioly Roman Empire func¬ 
tioned as filters for the revival of Roman forms. As a result, 
German Romanesque architecture, centered in the Rhineland, 
relied for its organization and formal vocabulary on buildings 
patronized by Carolingian and Ottoman rulers. 

SPEYER CATHEDRAL The cathedral of Speyer, which con¬ 
tained tombs of Fioly Roman emperors, was consecrated in 1061. 
It included a timber-roof nave (fig. 11 . 37 ), not unlike those of 
Carolingian and Ottoman buildings. A major rebuilding of the 
cathedral in 1080 added groin vaults to the nave (fig. 11 . 38 ), 
providing a solution to a problem that had limited Romanesque 
builders: While the barrel vault used in the churches we have pre¬ 
viously examined offered an aesthetically pleasing, acoustically 
resonant, and fire-resistant space, it limited the amount of light 
that could enter the nave. The problem was that the weakest part 
of the vault, the springing (the point where the arch rises from its 
support) was precisely the point where clerestory windows were 
needed. There had been exceptional buildings that included 
clerestories, such as Sant Vinceng at Cardona (see fig. 11.1) and 
the abbey church at Cluny (see fig. 11.11). But Sant Vincents

vaults. The use of these compound piers aligns Speyer with 
Romanesque buildings of other regions (see figs. 11.1, 11.5, and 
11.22). The alternating support system establishes a rhythm that 
must have struck a familiar chord in Germany. It had appeared in 
the Ottonian buildings of Gernrode (see fig. 10.23) and 
Hildesheim (see fig. 10.26), although in these buildings such a 
system was purely aesthetic. 


The Meuse Valley: Mosan Style 

An important group of Romanesque sculptors, who excelled in 
metalwork, operated in the valley of the Meuse River, which runs 
from northeastern France into present-day Belgium and Holland. 
This region had been the home of the classicizing Reims style in 
Carolingian times (see figs. 10.14, 10.15, and 10.16), and during 
the Romanesque period an awareness of classical sources again 
pervades its art, called Mosan. Abbot Hellinus of Liege commis¬ 
sioned a bronze baptismal font for the church of Notre-Dame- 
aux-Fonts in Liege (fig. 11.39). The generally accepted attribution 
to Renier of Huy, the earliest Mosan artist whose name we know, 
is largely circumstantial. The font, completed in 1118 and today in 
the church of Saint-Barthelemy is a remarkable achievement: 
Cast in one piece, it is over 2 feet high and 3M feet in diameter. The 
vessel rested on 12 oxen, like Solomons basin in the Temple at 
Jerusalem as described in the first book of Kings in the Hebrew 
Bible: “And he made the molten sea ... It stood upon twelve oxen 
... and all their hinder parts were inward.” Christian writers 
described Solomon s basin as a prototype for the baptismal font 
and the 12 oxen as precursors of the apostles. 


windows are limited in number and scale, and at Cluny it was 
necessary to employ a series of devices, including pointed arches 
and enlarged buttresses, to provide adequate support for the high 
barrel vault. 

The builders of Speyer cathedral solved this problem with the 
groin vault. (See Materials and Techniques , page 380.) The groin 
vault, which had been used so effectively by the Romans, 
efficiently channeled thrust onto four corner points. This allowed 
for open space under each arch, which could be used for window 
openings without diminishing the strength of the vault. The erec¬ 
tion of groin vaults in the nave of Speyer cathedral was accompa¬ 
nied by an enlargement of its clerestory windows. Romanesque 
builders knew the technology of groin-vault construction and had 
previously employed groin vaults to cover lower spaces, in side 
aisles and in crypts, as at Pisa (see fig. 11.34), but apparently they 
found them daunting to build on a large scale. Speyer represents a 
genuine breakthrough in building technology: The scale is so 
great that it dwarfs every other church of the period. 

The individual groin-vaulted bays at Speyer form a chain of 
compartmentalized units of space. Each groin vault comprises 
two bays of the original nave. Colonnettes attached to alternate 
piers articulate the distribution of weight necessary to support the

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Vaulting 


V aulting is a technique for covering buildings that is based on the 
principles of arcuation, that is, construction that uses the arch 
form (a). Although vaulting was used in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and 
Greece, it was the Etruscans and Romans who first exploited the 
vault for expressive and aesthetic purposes (see page 1 86). While 
most early medieval buildings were covered with timber-beam roofs, 
during the Romanesque period stone vaulting became the dominant 
roofing type. Its reintroduction in the eleventh century was a major 
component of the revival of Roman artistic forms during the 
Romanesque period. Although Roman vaults were principally made of 
concrete, medieval vaults were usually made either of rubble or 
masonry, bound with mortar. 

The erection of stone vaults in medieval buildings required enormous 
effort and great expense, but the benefits were numerous. These 
included fire resistance, particularly important for buildings illuminated 
by candles and for tall structures that attracted lightning. The history 
of medieval buildings is largely a history of fires. Widespread attacks 
by Vikings, Magyars from Hungary, and Muslims also made stronger 
buildings desirable. In addition, stone vaulting provides excellent 
acoustics, a significant consideration for churches in which the liturgy 
was chanted. No less important than these practical benefits were the 
aesthetic ones: Vaulted buildings appear dignified and monumental, 
and they provide an unambiguous sense of enclosure. There are many 
types of vaults: barrel, quadrant, groin, ribbed, and the dome. 

The barrel vault, essentially an arch projected in depth, is the most 
basic form (b). This was the first type exploited by medieval builders 
because it lent itself to covering rectangular basilicas. Unfortunately, 
the barrel vault creates dark spaces, since opening up the nave walls 
with clerestory windows weakens the vault at its most vulnerable 
point, the springing. It is here, at the base of the arch, that the force 
of gravity, which is channeled through the arch, results in lateral 
forces pushing sideways. This outward thrust needs to be contained, 
usually by building thick walls to buttress the vault. 

In Romanesque churches with wide side aisles, architects were faced 
with the problem of transferring the thrust of the barrel vault across 
the side aisles to the outer walls. They were able to do this by vaulting 


the galleries over the aisles with quadrant vaults (half-barrel vaults), 
which buttress the barrel vault of the nave. These buildings were also 
dark, with light entering only from windows at the ends of the barrel 
vaults and in the side walls, filtered through aisle and gallery before 
reaching the nave. 

The introduction of the groin vault provided for more luminous 
structures that required less building material; thus, buildings became 
lighter in both senses of the word. A groin vault is formed when two 
barrel vaults intersect (c); the thrust of each vault is countered by the 
vault running perpendicular to it. (The term “groin” refers to the junc¬ 
tion where the vaults intersect.) Thrust is thus channeled to four cor¬ 
ner points, allowing for windows or other openings in the wall under 
each of the intersecting arches. 

The ribbed vault, introduced at Durham cathedral, was probably 
invented as a decorative device (d); only later did architects and 
masons come to appreciate its structural advantages. Larger stones 
are placed on the groins of the vault to form diagonal arches. These 
function as a fixed scaffold to support the vault’s curved panels, called 
webs, which essentially fill the spaces between the ribs. Ribbed vaults 
were easier to construct and required less centering (see below) than 
unribbed vaults; their webs could be built of lighter material, since the 
ribbed groins channeled the major lateral thrust more efficiently. 

Romanesque masons also employed the dome, which is essentially 
an arch rotated on axis to form a vault (e). In Romanesque churches, 
domes cover centralized buildings or mark significant elements, for 
example the area where the transept crosses the nave. Vaults are not 
easy to construct and Romanesque vaults were heavy: Often more than 
a foot thick, each could weigh several tons. Arcuation is a dynamic sys¬ 
tem, with all its elements interlocked; as a result, the vault is stable 
only when it is complete. During construction it needs to be supported 
by a wooden framework, called a centering. Once the vault is built and 
the buttresses are in place, the vault becomes self-supporting and the 
centering can be removed. The widespread use of the vault and its 
progressive refinement during the Romanesque period represent 
significant achievements, which were crucial for the continued devel¬ 
opment of medieval building, particularly during the Gothic period.

380 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 























The reliefs are about the same height as those on the bronze 
doors of Bishop Bernward at Hildesheim (see fig. 10.27). Instead 
of the rough expressive power of the Ottoman panels, however, 
the viewer sees a harmonious balance of design, a subtle control 
of the sculptured surfaces, and an understanding of organic struc¬ 
ture that are surprisingly classical for a medieval work. The figure 
seen from the back (beyond the tree on the left), with its graceful 
movement and Greek-looking drapery, might almost be taken for 
a work from antiquity. Renier also expressed his interest in 
antique form through the use of bronze, rejecting the monumen- 
tality implicit in stone sculpture. The strong northern European 
metalwork tradition now serves to convey classical values, so 
alien to early medieval metalworkers who had previously domi¬ 
nated the art of this area. 

The Romanesque antique revival in the Mosan region has a 
special character, quite different from the abstract, decorative 
qualities that characterize the work of other regions, so demon¬ 
strating that while Romanesque art shares a common interest in 
reviving classical forms, there was great variety in the ways that 
classicism was expressed. The Liege font and other Mosan sculp¬ 
tures are carved in high relief or are fully three-dimensional, with 
convincing anatomical details and proportions. Yet, the concern 
of Mosan sculptors was not so much for naturalism as for an 
idealism that here produces classicizing forms. 


Normandy and England 

Farther north, Christianity was strongly supported by the 
Norman dukes and barons, former Vikings who had turned 
Normandy into a powerful feudal domain that included the 
allegiance of abbots and bishops as vassals in return for grants of 
land. Duke William II of Normandy actively promoted monastic 
reform and founded numerous abbeys. Normandy soon became a 
cultural center of international importance. When William 
invaded Anglo-Saxon England in 1066 and became king there, 
England became politically allied to northern France. For that 
reason Norman and English art of the Romanesque period share 
many stylistic traits. 

THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY The complex relationship between 
the Normans and the English is hinted at in the Bayeux Tapestry 
(figs. 11.40 and 11.41), important both as a historical record and 
as a work of art. In actuality it is not a tapestry at all, since it is not 
woven, but rather an embroidered linen frieze 230 feet long. The 
50 surviving scenes record the events, culminating in 1066, when 
William the Conqueror crossed the English Channel to claim the 
throne of England upon the death of King Edward the Confessor. 
According to the narrative of the “tapestry,” Harold, an Anglo- 
Saxon earl, had retracted his oath of fealty to William in order to

accept the throne offered him by the English nobles. William 
retaliated by invading England, and his Norman troops van¬ 
quished the English as Harold fell in battle. Since a Norman 
patron presumably commissioned the work, the story is told from 
the conquerors’ perspective, yet its manufacture has generally 
been credited to English needlewomen, justly famous during the 
Middle Ages for their skill. 

The Bayeux Tapestry exhibits the same monumentality and 
interest in narrative that we saw in the illuminations of the Gospel 
Book of Abbot Wedricus (see fig. 11.29), which, as noted, is a manu¬ 
script linked to both Normandy and England. The Bayeux designer 
has integrated narrative and ornament with complete ease. Two 
border strips frame the main frieze; while some of the images in 
these margins are decorative, others offer a commentary on the con¬ 
tinuous narrative. In one scene (see fig. 11.40), an aide announces 
to a recently crowned Harold the appearance of an amazing nat¬ 
ural phenomenon, represented in the upper border as a spinning 
star leaving its fiery trail. The inscription 1ST I MIRANT 
STELLA (“These men marvel at the star”) records the brilliant 
apparition of Halleys Comet in 1066, during the days immedi¬ 
ately following Harold s coronation. To the medieval viewer, the 
prophetic significance of the natural event would have been clear, 
especially when viewed after the fact. Beneath Harold, ghostly 
boats await the Normans, who are preparing to cross the English 
Channel. The scene foreshadows the violent events to come. 

Although the Bayeux Tapestry does not use the pictorial devices 
of classical painting, such as foreshortening and overlapping (see 


fig. 5.78), it presents a vivid and detailed account of warfare in the 
eleventh century as well as a hint of the Normans’ abilities as 
builders of fortresslike castles. The massed forms of the Graeco- 
Roman scene are replaced by a new kind of individualism that 
makes each figure a potential hero, whether by force or by 
cunning. Note how the soldier who has fallen from the horse 
with its hind legs in the air is, in turn, toppling his foe by yanking 
at the saddle girth of his mount. The kinship with the Corbie 
Gospel book manuscript (see fig. 11.27) is noticeable in the lively 
somersaults of the horses, so like the pose of the lion in the 
miniature. In the Middle Ages, the religious and secular spheres 
were not sharply distinguished from each other, and as such 
the same pictorial devices were employed in both. The energy and 
linear clarity of the Bayeux Tapestry and the Corbie Gospel 
book remind the viewer of the monumental figures of 
Romanesque sculpture. 

DURHAM CATHEDRAL Norman architecture is responsible 
for a great breakthrough in structural engineering, which took 
place in England, where King William made donations to build in 
a Norman style. Durham cathedral, begun in 1093, is among the 
largest churches of medieval Europe (fig. 11 . 42 ): Its nave is wider 
than that of Santiago de Compostela, and its overall length (400 
feet) is also greater. The nave may have been designed to be 
vaulted from the start. The vault over its eastern end had been 
completed by 1107, in a remarkably short space of time, and the 
rest of the nave was vaulted by 1130 (fig. 11 . 43 ).

This vault is of great interest. As the earliest systematic use of 
a ribbed groin vault over a three-story nave, it marks a basic 
advance beyond Speyer. Looking at the plan (see fig. 11.42), we 
see that the aisles consist of the usual almost-square groin-vaulted 
compartments. The bays of the nave, separated by strong transverse 


arches, are oblong and also groin-vaulted, so that the ribs of each 
bay form a double-X design. Each vault of the nave is thus 
divided into seven sections. These vaults are referred to as sept- 
partite (or seven-part) groin vaults. Since the nave bays are twice 
as long as the aisle bays, transverse arches occur only at the odd- 
numbered piers of the nave arcade (see fig. 11.43). The piers there¬ 
fore alternate in size. Unlike Speyer cathedral (see fig. 11.38), 
where a colonnette was added to every other nave pier to 
strengthen it, at Durham the odd-numbered piers are intrinsically 
different from the even-numbered ones. The odd-numbered 
ones are larger and compound, with bundles of column and 
pilaster shafts attached to a square or oblong core, while the even- 
numbered ones are thinner and cylindrical. 

The outward thrust and weight of the whole vault are concen¬ 
trated at six securely anchored points on the gallery level from 
which the ribs spring. The ribs were needed to provide a stable 
skeleton for the groin vault, and the curved surfaces between 
them were filled in with masonry of a minimal thickness. Thus, 
both weight and thrust were reduced, and carried downward to 
the outer wall of the aisles by buttresses (fig. 11 . 44 ). This flexible 



CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 383 







































































































system resulted in more efficient vault erection and greater econ¬ 
omy of construction. We do not know whether this ingenious 
scheme was actually invented at Durham, but it could not have 
been devised much earlier, for it is still in an experimental stage. 
While the transverse arches at the crossing are round, those to the 
west of it are slightly pointed, indicating an ongoing search for 
improvements. 

The ribbed groin-vault system had other advantages. From an 
aesthetic standpoint, the nave at Durham is among the finest in all 
Romanesque architecture. The sturdiness of the alternating 
piers makes a splendid contrast to the dramatically lit, sail-like 
surfaces of the vault. This relatively lightweight, flexible system 
permits broad expanses of great height to be covered with fire¬ 
proof vaulting and yet retain the ample lighting of a clerestory. 
Durham exhibits great structural strength; even so, the decoration 
incised in its round piers, each different from the others, and the 
pattern established by the vault ribs hark back to the Anglo-Saxon 
love of decoration and interest in surface pattern (see figs. 
10.1-10.3). 

SAINT-ETIENNE, CAEN The abbey church of Saint-Etienne 
at Caen (fig. 11.45) was founded by William the Conqueror a year 
or two after his invasion of England in 1066, but it took over 100 
years to complete. Over this period of time the fruits of Durham 
cathedral s ribbed groin-vault system matured. The west facade 
(fig. 11.46) offers a striking contrast with Notre-Dame-la-Grande 
in Poitiers (see fig. 11.30) and other Romanesque facades (see figs. 
11.13,11.17, and 11.31). The westwork proclaims this an imperial 
church. Its closest ancestors are Carolingian churches, such as the 
abbey church at Corvey (see fig. 10.21), built under royal patron¬ 
age. Like them, it has a minimum of decoration. Four huge but¬ 
tresses divide the front of the church into three vertical sections. 
The thrust upward continues in the two towers, the height of 
which would be impressive even without the tall helmets, which

are later additions. Saint-Etienne is cool and composed, encourag¬ 
ing viewers to appreciate its refined proportions, a feature shared 
with many other Romanesque buildings. 

In the interior of Saint-Etienne (fig. 11 . 47 ), the nave was 
originally planned to have a wooden ceiling, as well as galleries 
and a clerestory. After the experience of Durham, however, it 
became possible in the early twelfth century to build a groined 
nave vault, with only slight changes in the wall design. The bays 
of the nave here are approximately square (see fig. 11.45), whereas 


at Durham they were oblong. Therefore, the double-X rib pattern 
could be replaced by a single X with an additional transverse 
rib, which produced a sexpartite groin vault, with six sections 
instead of seven. These vaults are no longer separated by heavy 
transverse arches but instead by simple ribs. The resulting 
reduction in weight also gives a stronger sense of continuity to the 
nave vault as a whole and produces a less emphatic alternation of 
piers. Compared with Durham, the nave of Saint-Etienne has an 
airy lightness. 


CHAPTER 11 ROMANESQUE ART 385 


















THE PARADOXICAL MEANING 
OF ROMANESQUE 

The improved economic conditions and political stability of 
Europe, outlined at the beginning of this chapter, had their 
rewards in the secure structures built in the twelfth century. 
However, the architectures defensive qualities also suggest a 
paradox: As much as the stalwart, powerfully built buildings 
express a newfound confidence, they also reveal lingering appre¬ 
hension. The terrifying Last Judgment scenes (see fig. 11.17) and 
other Romanesque visions of monsters and diabolical beings 
attest to this anxiety. A folio of the Winchester Psalter (fig. 11.48), 
produced in England during the middle of the twelfth century, 
depicts a large Hell mouth: The heavy arched jaws of the devil s 
head contain monstrous forms devouring sinners of all classes. 


The inscription, written in Anglo-Norman French, translates as: 
“Here is Hell and the angels who lock the doors.” The heavy 
walls and repeated enclosures that govern so much Romanesque 
sculpture and architecture have their counterpart in this represen¬ 
tation. The frame, with its serene cadence of heavily outlined 
decorations, encloses and controls the frightening image. 

The manuscript was commissioned by Henry of Blois, bishop 
of Winchester, who had been a monk at Cluny and collected 
antique sculpture and Byzantine paintings on his journeys to 
Rome. The Winchester Psalter exemplifies how international artis¬ 
tic forces functioned during the Romanesque period to help 
create a vision expressive of the hopes and fears of a society 
yearning for protection from dark elements. It is instructive that, 
in the end, assistance from a heavenly being—the angel who locks 
the Hell-mouth door—is required to contain the potent forces 
of evil.

Gothic Art 


i\j 


T he gothic era unfolded in a process of geographic 

expansion, its rapid growth demonstrating its broad visual and 
expressive appeal. At the start, about 1140, the area in which Gothic 
art was produced was small indeed. It included only the province 
known as the Ile-de-France (Paris and vicinity), the royal domain of the French 


kings (see map 12 . 1 ). A hundred years later, most of western 
Europe, from Sicily to Norway, had adopted the Gothic style, 
with only a few Romanesque pockets left here and there. By 1400, 
however, the Gothic area had begun to shrink. It no longer 
included Italy, and by 1550 it had disappeared almost entirely, 
except in England. The Gothic layer, then, has a rather compli¬ 
cated shape. Its depth ranges from close to 400 years in some 
places to only 150 in others. 

The term Gothic was used in the sixteenth century to describe 
a style of buildings thought to have descended from the Goths, 
those tribes that occupied northern Europe during the early 
Middle Ages. Although the ancestry of the style is not as direct as 
these early writers claimed, they were accurate about its geogra¬ 
phy, since the style is most recognizable north of the Alps. As 
Gothic art spread from the Ile-de-France to the rest of the 
country and then through all of Europe, it was referred to as opus 
modernum (modern work) or opus francigenum (French work). 
These designations are significant, because they tell us that in its 
own time the style was viewed as innovative and as having its 
origins in France. In the course of the thirteenth century, the new 
style gradually lost its imported flavor, and regional variety began 
to reassert itself.

Notre-Dame, Chartres 


For a century—from about 1150 to 1250, during the Age of 
the Great Cathedrals—architecture played the dominant role in 
the formation of a coherent Gothic style. In addition to religious 
buildings, secular architecture—including castles, palaces, and 
civic buildings, such as hospitals—also flourished during the 
Gothic period. Gothic sculpture was at first severely architectural 
in spirit but became more independent after 1200. Late Gothic 
architecture and sculpture strive for more pictorial effects. 

Artistic developments roughly parallel what was happening in 
the political arena, for the Gothic was a distinctive period not 
only artistically but politically as well. Aided by technological 
advances including cannon and iron crossbow design, princes and 
kings were able to conquer increasingly large territories, which 
were administered for them by vassals, who in turn collected taxes 
to support armies and navies. In France, the Capetian line at first 
ruled only the fertile territory of the Ile-de-France, but by 1300 it 
had added much of the land previously held by the count of 
Flanders, as well as Bourges, Tours, and Amiens—all of which 
were to become the sites of important Gothic cathedrals—and the 
central provinces of the Auvergne and the southern provinces of 
Languedoc. King Philip Augustus, who reigned from 1180 to 
1223, was able to quadruple the size of the royal domain and, at 
the same time, concentrate authority in the figure of the king. The 
French kings also acquired Normandy from England. This gave 
rise to the conflicting claims over the kingship of France known 
as the Hundred Years’ War (1339-1453), which consolidated a

CHAPTER 





Map 1 2.1 Europe in the Gothic period 


growing sense of nationalism on both sides of the English 
Channel. While much Gothic art seems to develop in a logical 
manner, the Hundred Years’ War, with its shifting alliances and 
threats to economic and social stability, interrupted the produc¬ 
tion of art in some areas of Europe. 

Germany remained a collection of independent city-states 
ruled by electors, who were responsible for, among other things, 
choosing kings. The powers of German kings were therefore 
severely limited. Supported by shifting alliances with the papacy, 
the kings of France and England emerged as the leading powers at 
the expense of the Germans in the early thirteenth century, which 
was generally a time of peace and prosperity. After 1290, however, 
the balance of power broke down. 

The growth of urban centers and the increasing importance of 
cathedrals, the seats of bishops, are formative features of the 
Gothic period. In the century before the death of King Louis IX 
in 1270, there were 80 cathedrals built in France, many of them 


new foundations. Universities developed out of cathedral schools 
as the principal centers of learning, thus taking on the role previ¬ 
ously played by monasteries. Universities provided instruction in 
theology, philosophy, law, and medicine, those areas of study 
deemed necessary for universitas litterarum (universal learning). 
At the same time, literature written in the vernacular (as opposed 
to Latin) began to emerge, making it accessible to a broader pub¬ 
lic. It was during the thirteenth century that French became an 
official state language. Romanesque art had been predominantly a 
rural and monastic art, while Gothic art, by contrast, was increas¬ 
ingly cosmopolitan. 

Urban growth was both the result and cause of economic, 
social, and demographic changes. Agriculture became more 
efficient, with increased acreage under cultivation, and surplus 
production provided commodities for sale and purchase. This 
produced, in turn, a money economy based on investment, profit, 
and trade, in place of barter. Money rather than personal services 


390 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 
















now directed social interchange, and the increased amount of it in 
circulation produced a veritable middle class, living in cities, 
which were the centers of trade and commerce. Once out from 
under the feudal yoke, merchants and artists of this middle class 
were free to form guilds to control the production and distribu¬ 
tion of goods and services. A general and significant increase in 
population also spurred urban growth. Roughly 42 million 
people occupied Europe around the year 1000; by 1300, the pop¬ 
ulation had reached about 73 million. 

During the thirteenth century, Western European Christianity 
found in St. Thomas Aquinas its greatest intellect since St. 
Augustine and St. Jerome some 850 years earlier. Aquinas, an 
Italian theologian, studied in Cologne and taught in Paris. His 
method of argument, called scholasticism, used reason to under¬ 
stand and explain faith. Scholasticism had a profound effect on 
European thought; its harmonization of rationalism and spiritual¬ 
ity effectively sanctioned the systematic study of all natural 
phenomena as expressions of divine truths. Gothic builders 
shared qualities with the Scholastics. They brought the logic and 
clarity of engineering principles to bear on revelation, using phys¬ 
ical forces to create a concord of spiritual experiences in much the 
same way the Scholastics used elucidation and clarification to 
build their well-constructed arguments. 

EARLY GOTHIC ART IN FRANCE 

It is not clear why Gothic art first appeared in the Ile-de-France, 
the area around Paris. Some scholars believe that because this 
region had not developed a strong local style during the 
Romanesque period, it was particularly open to innovation and 
influence from other areas. Others have suggested that it was a 
result of a concerted effort on the part of the kings of France to 
aggrandize themselves, since it was here that their domains were 
located. Certainly the Ile-de-France is fortuitously positioned, 
near the center of France and thus accessible to the south and 
west, where major sculptural programs flourished during the 
Romanesque period, and adjacent to Normandy, where many 
structural innovations, including the ribbed groin vault, had been 
introduced to France. 

Saint-Denis: Suger and 

the Beginnings of Gothic Architecture 

The study of Gothic art begins with an examination of the 
rebuilding of the royal abbey church of Saint-Denis just outside 
the city of Paris. The rebuilding of this historic church was under¬ 
taken between 1137 and 1144 by its abbot, Suger. His ambitious 
building program was designed to emphasize the relationship 
between Saint-Denis and the French monarchy. The kings of 
France, who belonged to the Capetian line, in practice had less 
power than the nobles who, in theory, were their vassals. The only 
area the king ruled directly was the Ile-de-France, and even there 
his authority was often challenged. Not until the early twelfth 


century did royal power begin to expand, and Suger, as chief advi¬ 
sor to King Fouis VI, helped shape this process. It was Suger who 
forged the alliance between the monarchy and the Church. This 
union brought the bishops of France (and the cities under their 
authority) to the king s side; the king, in turn, supported the 
papacy in its struggle against the German emperors. 

Suger also engaged in spiritual politics. By giving the monar¬ 
chy religious significance and glorifying it as the strong right arm 
of justice, he sought to rally the nation behind the king. Saint- 
Denis was a key element in his plan. The church, founded in the 
late eighth century, enjoyed a dual prestige. It was the shrine of St. 
Denis, the Apostle of France and its patron saint, as well as the 
chief memorial of the Carolingian dynasty from which the 
Capetians drew their authority. Both Charlemagne and his father, 
Pepin, were consecrated as kings at Saint-Denis. It was also the 
burial place of the kings Charles Martel, Pepin, and Charles the 
Bald. Suger aspired to make the abbey the spiritual center of 
France, a pilgrimage church to outshine all others and to provide 
a focal point for religious as well as patriotic emotion. To achieve 
this goal, the old structure had to be rebuilt and enlarged. The 
great abbot himself wrote two accounts of the church and its 
rebuilding. (See Primary Source, page 393.) 

AMBULATORY AND CHOIR The ambulatory and radiating 
chapels surrounding the arcaded apse (figs. 12.1 and 12 . 2 ) are 
familiar elements from the Romanesque pilgrimage choir (see fig. 
11.3), but at Saint-Denis they have been integrated in a new way. 
The choir is as rationally planned and constructed as in any 
Romanesque church, yet the entire plan is held together by a new 
kind of geometric order (see fig. 12.1). Seven nearly identical 
wedge-shaped units fan out from the center of the apse. Instead of 
being in separate apsidioles, the chapels merge to form, in effect, 
a second ambulatory. We experience this double ambulatory not 
as a series of individual compartments but as a continuous space, 
the shape of which is outlined by the network of slender arches, 
ribs, and columns that sustains the vaults. Ribbed groin vaulting 
based on the pointed arch is used throughout. By this date, the 
pointed arch (which can be “stretched” to reach any desired 
height regardless of the width of its base) has become an essential 
part of the ribbed groin vault, which is no longer restricted to 
square or near-square compartments. It has a new flexibility that 
allows it to cover areas of almost any shape, such as the trapezoids 
and pentagons of this ambulatory. 

What most distinguishes the interior of Saint-Denis (see fig. 
12.2) from earlier church interiors is its lightness, in both senses 
of the word. The architectural forms seem graceful, almost 
weightless, compared to the massive solidity of Romanesque 
architecture. The fluid spaciousness of Saint-Denis’ choir results 
from its slim columns, whose use was made possible by the rela¬ 
tive lightness of the vaults they needed to support. In addition, the 
windows are so large that they no longer give the impression of 
being openings cut into a wall but, in effect, translucent walls, 
consisting of stained glass. What makes this abundance of light 
possible are heavy buttresses that jut out between the chapels to

contain the outward pressure of the vaults. In the plan (see fig. 
12.1), they look like stubby arrows pointing toward the center of 
the apse. No wonder, then, that the interior appears so airy, since 
the heaviest parts of the structural skeleton are relegated to the 
exterior. The impression would be even more striking if we could 
see all of Suger s choir, for the upper part of the apse, rising above 
the double ambulatory, had very large, tall windows. 
Unfortunately, later transformations of the building destroyed 
the choir s original effect. 

In describing Sugers ambulatory and choir, we have also 
described the essentials of Gothic architecture. Yet none of the 
elements that makes up its design is really new. The pilgrimage 
choir plan, the pointed arch, and the ribbed groin vault can be 
found in regional schools of the French and Anglo-Norman 
Romanesque. However, their combination in the same building 
was of such importance to Suger that—as he himself tells us— 
he brought together artisans from many different regions for 
Saint-Denis. We must not conclude from this, however, that 
Gothic architecture was merely a synthesis of Romanesque traits. 
If we did, we would be hard pressed to explain the new spirit, 
particularly the quest for luminosity, that strikes us so forcibly at 
Saint-Denis. Suger s account of the rebuilding of his church 
stresses luminosity as the highest value achieved in the new struc¬ 
ture. Thus, Suger suggests, the “miraculous” light that floods the 
choir through the “most sacred” stained-glass windows becomes 
the Light Divine, a revelation of the spirit of God. Suger also 
claims that harmony, the perfect relationship among parts in 
terms of mathematical proportions or ratios, is the source of all 
beauty, since it exemplifies the laws by which divine reason made 
the universe. 

This symbolic interpretation of light and numerical harmony 
was well established in Christian thought long before Suger s 
time. It derived from the writings of a sixth-century Greek the¬ 
ologian who, in the Middle Ages, was mistakenly believed to have 



12.2 Ambulatory of abbey church of Saint-Denis 


been Dionysius the Areopagite, an Athenian disciple of St. Paul, 
who is mentioned in the New Testament book of Acts. In France, 
the writer Dionysius was identified with St. Denis, since the 
saints name in Latin is Dionysius. Not surprisingly, Suger 
attached great authority to the writings of Dionysius, which were 
available to him in the library at Saint-Denis; Dionysian light- 
and-number symbolism particularly appealed to him 

At the heart of Suger s mystical intent for Saint-Denis was the 
belief that the material realm is the steppingstone for spiritual 
contemplation and thus that dark, jewel-like light filtering 
through the church’s stained-glass windows would transport the 
viewer to “some strange region of the universe which neither 
exists entirely in the slime of earth nor entirely in the purity of

Suger of Saint-Denis 
(1081-1151) 

From On the Consecration of the Church of Saint- 
Denis and On What Was Done Under His 
Administration 

Abbot Suger lefi two accounts of his rebuilding of the abbey church of 
Saint-Denis. He justifies his enlargement of the Carolingian building 
with re ference to its overcrowding on religious holidays. Afier rebuild¬ 
ing the west end of the Carolingian church , he destroyed its eastern apse 
and built a much larger , more elaborate choir over the old crypt. Saint- 
Denis was a Benedictine abbey , though its church was open to lay folk 
and attracted them in large numbers. The ostentatious embellishment of 
the church was the type of material display deplored by St. Bernard of 
Clairvaux (see page 359). Suger’s descriptions of Saint-Denis suggest a 
sensuous love of precious materials , but also a belief that contemplation 
of these materials could lead the worshiper to a state of heightened spir¬ 
itual awareness. Like the Byzantine rationale for icons , the notion of 
“anagogical” transportation to another dimension is indebted to Neo- 
Platonism. 

T hrough a fortunate circumstance—the number of the faithful 
growing and frequently gathering to seek the intercession of the 
Saints—the [old] basilica had come to suffer grave inconveniences. 
Often on feast days, completely filled, it disgorged through all its 
doors the excess of the crowds as they moved in opposite directions, 
and the outward pressure of the foremost ones not only prevented 
those attempting to enter from entering but also expelled those who 
had already entered. At times you could see that no one among the 
countless thousands of people because of their very density could 
move a foot; that no one, because of their very congestion, could [do] 
anything but stand like a marble statue, stay benumbed or, as a last 
resort, scream. The distress of the women was so great and so intol¬ 
erable that you could see how they cried out horribly, how several of 
them, lifted by the pious assistance of men above the heads of the 


crowd, marched forward as though upon a pavement; and how many 
others, gasping with their last breath, panted in the cloisters of the 
brethren to the despair of everyone ... 

Moreover, it was cunningly provided that—through the upper 
columns and central arches which were to be placed upon the lower 
ones built in the crypt—the central nave of the old [church] should be 
equalized, by means of geometrical and arithmetical instruments, with 
the central nave of the new addition; and, likewise, that the dimen¬ 
sions of the old side-aisles should be equalized with the dimensions 
of the new side-aisles, except for that elegant and praiseworthy exten¬ 
sion, in [the form of] a circular string of chapels, by virtue of which 
the whole [church] would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted 
light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty. ... 

We insisted that the adorable, life-giving cross should be adorned. 
Therefore we searched around everywhere by ourselves and by our 
agents for an abundance of precious pearls and gems. One merry but 
notable miracle which the Lord granted us in this connection we do 
not wish to pass over. For when I was in difficulty for want of gems 
and could not sufficiently provide myself with more (for their 
scarcity makes them very expensive): then, lo and behold, [monks] 
from three abbeys of two Orders—that is, from Citeaux and another 
abbey of the [Cistercian] Order, and from Fontevrault offered us for 
sale an abundance of gems such as we had not hoped to find in ten 
years, hyacinths, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, topazes. ... 

Often we contemplate these different ornaments both new and old. 
When the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away 
from external cares, and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect, 
transferring that which is material to that which is immaterial, on the 
diversity of the sacred virtues: then it seems to me that I see myself 
dwelling, as it were, in some strange region of the universe which nei¬ 
ther exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely in the purity 
of Heaven; and that, by the grace of God, I can be transported from 
this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical manner. 

We [also] caused to be painted, by the exquisite hands of many 
masters from different regions, a splendid variety of new windows.

Heaven.” The success of the choir design at Saint-Denis, there¬ 
fore, derives not only from its architectural qualities but also from 
its extraordinary psychological impact. Visitors, it seems, were 
overwhelmed by both, and within a few decades the new style had 
spread far beyond the Ile-de-France. 

SUGER AND THE MEDIEVAL ARCHITECT Although 
Suger was not an architect, there is no contradiction between his 
lack of professional training and his claim of responsibility for the 
technical advances and resultant style of “his” new church. In the 
twelfth century, the term “architect” had a very different meaning 
from what it does today. To the medieval mind, the overall leader 
of the project could be considered its architect. Even God, as cre¬ 
ator of the universe, was sometimes represented as an architect 
employing builders’ tools. After all, the function of a church is 
not merely to enclose a maximum of space with a minimum of 


material, but also to embody and convey religious ideas. For the 
master who built the choir of Saint-Denis, the technical problems 
of vaulting must have been inseparable from issues of form and 
meaning. The design includes elements that express function 
without actually performing it. An example is the slender column 
shafts (responds) that seem to transfer the weight of the vaults to 
the church floor. 

In order to know what concepts to convey, the medieval 
builder needed the guidance of religious authority. At a minimum, 
such guidance might be a simple directive to follow some estab¬ 
lished model. Suger, however, took a more active role, proposing 
objectives to which his master masons must have been singularly 
responsive. Close collaboration between patron and architect 
or master builder had of course occurred before—between

12.3 West facade of abbey church of Saint-Denis, ca. 1137-40 


CONSTRUCTING SAINT-DENIS Building Saint-Denis was an 
expensive and complex task that required the combined resources 
of Church and State. Suger used stone from quarries near 
Pontoise for the ambulatory columns and lumber from the forest 
of Yvelines for the roof. Both had to be transported by land and 
river, which was a slow and costly process. The master builder 


probably employed several hundred stonemasons and two or 
three times that many laborers. Advances in technology spurred 
by warfare made possible improved construction techniques that 
were essential for building the new rib vaults. Especially impor¬ 
tant were better cranes powered by windlasses, treadwheels that 
used counterweights, and double pulleys for greater efficiency. 


394 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 

































These devices could be put up and taken down with ease, allow¬ 
ing for lighter scaffolding suspended from the wall instead of 
resting on the ground. 

WEST FACADE Although Abbot Suger planned to rebuild all 
of Saint-Denis, the only part of the church that he saw completed, 
other than the ambulatory and choir, was the west facade. Its 
overall design (fig. 12.3) derived from Norman Romanesque 
facades. A comparison between Saint-Denis and Saint-Etienne at 
Caen (see fig. 11.46) reveals a number of shared basic features. 
These include the pier buttresses that reinforce the corners of the 
towers and divide the facade vertically into three main parts, the 
placement of the portals, and the three-story arrangement. 
However, Saint-Denis s three portals are far larger and more 
richly carved than those at Saint-Etienne or any other Norman 
Romanesque church. From this we can conjecture that Abbot 
Suger attached considerable importance to the sculptural decora¬ 
tion of Saint-Denis, although his account of the church does not 
discuss it at length. 

The rich sculptural decoration included carved tympana, 
archivolts, and jambs. The arrangement recalls the facades of 
southwestern France (see fig. 11.13) and the carved portals of 
Burgundy (see fig. 11.17). These correlations corroborate Suger s 
claim that his workforce included artists from many regions. 
Unhappily, the trumeau figure of St. Denis and the statue- 
columns of the jambs were removed in 1770 and 1771, when the 
central portal was enlarged. A few years later, during the French 
Revolution, a mob attacked the heads of the remaining figures and 
melted down the metal doors. As a result of these ravages and a 
series of clumsy restorations undertaken during the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries, we can gain only a general view of 
Suger s ideas about the role of sculpture at Saint-Denis. To 
envision what the west portal originally looked like we have to 
turn to the cathedral of Chartres, where some of the Saint-Denis 
sculptors subsequently worked. 

Chartres Cathedral 

Toward 1145 the bishop of the town of Chartres, who was a 
friend of Abbot Suger and shared many of his ideas, began to 
rebuild a cathedral in the new style, dedicated to Notre-Dame 
(“Our Lady,” the Virgin Mary). Fifty years later a fire destroyed 
all but the eastern crypt and the west facade. (See www.mvarts 
lab.cc m.) Our discussion of Chartres is divided into two sections: 
First we will discuss the west facade and later in the chapter that 
portion of the cathedral rebuilt after the fire of 1194. 

WEST FACADE The surviving west facade (fig. 12.4), in many 
ways reminiscent of Saint-Denis, is divided into units of two and 
three and is a model of clarity. Yet, because construction pro¬ 
ceeded in stages and was never entirely finished, the harmony of 
the result is evolutionary rather than systematic. For example, the 
two west towers, though similar, are by no means identical. 
Moreover, their spires, the tall towers with tapering roofs, are 



12.4 West facade of cathedral of Notre-Dame, Chartres, France, 
ca. 1145-1220. (Left spire is from 16th century) 


very different: That on the left in figure 12.4 dates from the early 
sixteenth century, nearly 300 years later than its mate. 

To judge from old drawings of Saint-Denis, the Chartres 
jambs (figs. 12.5 and 12.6) are so similar to those of the original 
Saint-Denis portals that the same sculptors must have worked on 
both buildings. Tall figures attached to columns flanked the door¬ 
ways of both churches. Figures had appeared on the jambs or 
trumeaux of Romanesque portals (see figs. 11.13 and 11.15), but 
they were reliefs carved from the masonry of the doorway. The 
Chartres jamb figures, in contrast, are essentially statues, each 
with its own axis. They could, in theory at least, be detached from 
their supports. This is a development of truly revolutionary 
importance and could apparently be made only by borrowing the 
cylindrical shape of the column for the human figure. That the 
figures are round gives them a corporeal presence, and their heads

show a gentle, human quality that indicates a naturalistic trend in 
Gothic sculpture, quite different from the apparent aims of 
Romanesque sculptors to accentuate stylization. 

On the west portal of Chartres naturalism appears as if in 
reaction against the fantastic and demoniacal aspects of 
Romanesque art, a response that may be seen in the solemn spirit 
of the figures and their increased physical bulk. This is apparent 
by comparing the Christ of Chartress center tympanum (see fig. 
12.5) with his counterpart in the tympanum at Moissac (see fig. 
11.13). It also appears in the visual and thematic unity underlying 
the entire sculptural program at Chartres. While an understand¬ 
ing of the subtler aspects of this program requires a knowledge of 
the theology that would have been taught by leading scholars of 
the day at the Chartres cathedral school, its main elements can be 
readily understood. 

The jamb statues form a continuous sequence linking all three 
portals (see fig. 12.5). Together they represent the prophets, kings, 
and queens of the Hebrew Bible. Their purpose is to acclaim the 
rulers of France as their spiritual descendants, and to stress the 


harmony of spiritual and secular rule, of priests (or bishops) and 
kings—ideals previously put forward by Abbot Suger. Above the 
main doorway, symbols of the four evangelists flank Christ in 
Majesty. The apostles are below, while the 24 elders (see page 
361) occupy the two outer archivolts. Although the components 
are similar to those of the Moissac tympanum, the effect at 
Chartres is calm and comforting whereas at Moissac the effect is 
dramatic and unsettling. The right-hand tympanum at Chartres 
shows Christs Incarnation: the Birth, the Presentation in the 
Temple, and the infant Christ Child on the lap of the Virgin, who 
symbolizes the Church. The design achieves compositional and 
thematic unity by elevating Christ in the center of each register: 
on the manger, on an altar, and on the lap of his mother. In the 
surrounding archivolts, representations of the liberal arts as 
human wisdom pay homage to the divine wisdom of Christ. 
Finally in the left-hand tympanum, we see the timeless Heavenly 
Christ (or perhaps the Christ of the Ascension) framed by the 
ever-repeating cycle of the year: the signs of the zodiac and their 
earthly counterparts, the labors of the 12 months.

Laon Cathedral 

Because the mid-twelfth-century church that stood behind the 
west facade of Chartres cathedral was destroyed by fire in 
1194, we must turn to the cathedral of Notre-Dame at Laon to 
appreciate an Early Gothic interior. This cathedral was begun just 
before 1160. 


NAVE The interior elevation of Laon cathedral (fig. 12.7) 
includes a nave arcade, gallery, triforium, and clerestory, all fea¬ 
tures found in Romanesque architecture but never together in the 
same building. The stacking of four levels is a Gothic innovation 
and lightens the weight of the walls. The elevation develops logi¬ 
cally and harmoniously: The single opening of the nave arcade is 
doubled in the gallery, then triple arches follow in the triforium, 
while a broad clerestory window balances the single nave arcade 
opening that began the vertical sequence. The rhythmical arrange¬ 
ment articulates a heightened sense of verticality, while the multi¬ 
ple openings allow increased light to enter the nave, directly from 
the clerestory and indirectly through galleries and side aisles. 

Sexpartite nave vaults over squarish bays at Laon continue the 
kind of structural experimentation begun by the Norman 
Romanesque builders of Saint-Etienne at Caen (see fig. 11.47) and 
Durham cathedral (see fig. 11.43). Laon uses the pointed ribbed 
vaults, pioneered in the western bays of the nave at Durham, 
throughout the building. Alternating bundles of shafts rising

CHAPTER 1 2 GOTHIC ART 397 











































































along the wall reflect the nature of the sexpartite vaults above: 
Clusters of five colonnettes indicate where transverse arches cross 
the nave, while three colonnettes adorn the intermediate piers. 
Although the system develops from Romanesque building prac¬ 
tice (see pages 350 and 353), the elements seem more delicate in 
the Gothic building. By contrast, Romanesque interiors such as 
Santiago de Compostela (see fig. 11.5) and Durham cathedral (see 
fig. 11.43) emphasize the great effort required to support the 
weight of the vaults. 

Some scholars see a change in program at Laon as revealing the 
evolving objectives of this cathedrals designers. At the east end of 
the nave, where the building work began, clustered shafts were 
added to piers as well as to the wall. In the later, more westerly 
nave bays, the round piers are plain. Instead of the staggered 
rhythm created by the earlier alternating pier arrangement, the 


change produced a more flowing effect. However, the tradeoff for 
the increased uniformity of the new arrangement was a loss of 
structural explicitness. For other scholars, the shafts attached to 
the Laon nave piers mark a liturgical division in the building, the 
site of a screen separating the choir occupied by clerics from the 
spaces used by the lay congregation. Gothic churches, like earlier 
religious buildings (see page 238), were settings for devotions and 
backdrops for the performance of the liturgy; as such, they 
framed the movements and words sung in processions and prac¬ 
ticed in sacramental rites.

Laon, although there is evidence that it might actually have been 
started as early as the mid-1150s. Notre-Dame, Paris is extraordi¬ 
narily compact and achieves a unity not present in either 
Romanesque buildings or earlier Gothic ones (fig. 12.8). 

NAVE The transept of the church barely exceeds the width of the 
facade, perhaps a result of the cathedral s she adjacency to the 
Seine River, which might not have allowed for a boldly projecting 
transept. As at Saint-Denis (see fig. 12.1), the double ambulatory 
of the choir continues directly into the aisles, but there are no 
radiating chapels. This stress on uniformity in the plan finds a 
parallel in the treatment of the elevation; despite the use of sexpar- 
tite vaults, there is no alternating system of supports. As at Laon 
(see fig. 12.7), the Paris elevation was originally four-part, though 


oculi were inserted in place of the arcaded triforium. Stylish as 
this change might have been when the building was begun, a 
thirteenth-century reconstruction completely eliminated the 
triforium in order to enlarge the clerestory windows. Because a 
few bays were returned to their original four-part elevation in a 
nineteenth-century restoration, we can compare the original and 
the remodeled elevations (fig. 12.9). The design change reveals a 
continuing desire to reduce wall surface and increase the amount 
of light entering the building. The large clerestory windows and 
the light and slender forms produce nave walls that seem amaz¬ 
ingly thin. This creates an effect of weightlessness. 

Like uniformity in the plan, the vertical emphasis of the 
interior is a clear Gothic trait. It depends not only on the actual 
proportions of the nave, but also on a constant and repeated 
accentuation of upward momentum and the apparent ease with 
which a sense of height is attained. 

WEST FACADE The most monumental aspect of the exterior of 
Notre-Dame in Paris is its west facade (fig. 12.10). This retains its 
original appearance, except for the sculpture, which was badly 
damaged during the French Revolution and is largely restored. 
All of its details are integrated into a coherent whole. Here, the 
meaning of Suger s emphasis on harmony, geometric order, and 
proportion is even more evident than at Saint-Denis itself and the 
result goes well beyond the achievement of Chartres cathedral s 
west portal. 

This formal discipline is also apparent in the placement of 
the sculpture, which no longer shows the spontaneous growth 
typical of the Romanesque. Instead, it has been assigned a precise 
role within the architectural framework. At the same time, the 
cubic solidity of the facade has been moderated by lacelike 
arcades and window perforations, which break down the continu¬ 
ity of the wall surfaces so that the total effect is of a weightless 
openwork screen. 


HIGH GOTHIC ART IN FRANCE 

The political and economic stability of France during the 
thirteenth century encouraged the continued growth of cities, an 
ideal context for producing monumental architecture. Some art 
historians have seen the attempts to integrate structure and design 
in Early Gothic art as a series of experiments that were resolved 
during the High Gothic period. This is undoubtedly true to some 
extent, but the art of the thirteenth century also demonstrates an 
interest in pursuing refinements that synthesize engineering and 
aesthetics. Thus, High Gothic art is as much a continuation of 
Early Gothic experiments as it is their culmination. It is during 
this time that the names of architects, who previously had been 
largely anonymous, proliferate, a reflection of the value placed on 
their achievements and of an increasing interest in personal 
identity. This concern for the individual also reflects a changing 
class structure in which those engaged in trade and commerce 
become more independent. 


CHAPTER 1 2 GOTHIC ART 399 





















































The Rebuilding of Chartres Cathedral 

The rebuilding of Chartres cathedral after the fire of 1194 marks 
the next step in the development of Gothic architecture. The new 
building was largely completed within an astonishingly brief span 
of 26 years. Its crypt houses Chartress most important posses¬ 
sion: remnants of a tunic said to have been worn by the Virgin 
Mary, to whom the cathedral is dedicated, at the time of Jesus’ 
nativity. The relic, which miraculously survived the great fire of 
1194, had drawn pilgrims from all over Europe. 

The fire also spared the west facade and portals, and the deci¬ 
sion to conserve these architectural features—which, at the time of 
the fire, were nearly 50 years old and certainly out of fashion—is 
worth noting. After initial despair at the damage wrought 
by the fire, civic and ecclesiastical authorities animated their fol¬ 
lowers by interpreting the event as an expression of the will of

the Virgin herself that a new and more glorious cathedral be 
built. Since the west end of the church, like the famous relic of 
the Virgin, had also been spared, it too was treated as a relic wor¬ 
thy of preservation. Recognizing the divine plan in what otherwise 
would have been disheartening circumstances helped fuel enthusi¬ 
asm for rebuilding and accounts for the rapid pace of construction. 

To provide room for large numbers of visitors without 
disturbing worshipers, there is a wide aisle running the length of 
the nave and around the transept (fig. 12.11). It is joined at the 
choir by a second aisle, forming an ambulatory that connects the 
apsidal chapels. Worshipers entered the building through the old 


west portal and passed through a relatively low narthex. It would 
have taken some time for their eyes to adjust to the darkness of 
the interior. Even the noise of daily life would have been shut out, 
and sounds within the building would have been at first eerily 
muffled. Once worshipers had recovered from this disorienting 
effect, they would have become aware of a glimmering light, 
which guided them into the cavernous church. The transition, 
both subtle and profound, accentuated the significance of enter¬ 
ing the church. As with entries into Romanesque and Byzantine 
churches (see pages 256-57 and 362), a liminal, or transitional, 
zone signaled that visitors had left the temporal world behind. 
Patrons, designers, and builders of a religious edifice had again 
found meaningful physical forms to encourage and sustain 
powerful spiritual experiences. 

NAVE Designed a generation after Notre-Dame in Paris, the 
rebuilt nave of Chartres cathedral (fig. 12.12) is the first fully 
developed example of the mature, or High, Gothic. Several 
features distinguish this style. By eliminating the gallery, the 
designers of Chartres imposed a three-part elevation on the wall 
(fig. 12.13). Romanesque builders had used tripartite wall divi¬ 
sions (see figs. 11.11, 11.43, and 11.47), but the Chartres solution 
diminishes horizontality and treats the wall surface as a coherent 
vertical unit. (It was in an attempt to rival High Gothic buildings 
such as Chartres that the Early Gothic nave wall of Notre-Dame 
in Paris was reconfigured into a three-part elevation from its orig¬ 
inal Early Gothic four-part form [see fig. 12.9].) Shafts attached to 
the piers at Chartres stress the continuity of the vertical lines and 
guide our eye upward to the vaults, which appear as diaphanous 
webs stretched across the slender ribs. Quadripartite, or four- 
part, vaults now replace the sexpartite vaults of Early Gothic 
buildings (fig. 12.14). Quadripartite vaults cover rectangular bays 
and, as a result, the builders no longer needed to worry about an 
alternating system of supports. The quickened rhythm of shorter, 
rectangular bays intensifies the perceived pace of propulsion 
down the nave. The openings of the pointed nave arcade are taller 
and narrower than before, and the clerestory is larger so that it is 
the same height as the nave arcade. Because there are so few walls, 
the vast interior space appears at first to lack clear boundaries.

Theophilus Presbyter 
(12th century) 



De diversis artibus, from Book II: “The Art of the 
Worker in Glass” 

“Theophilus ” may have been the peudonym o f Roger ofHelmarshausen, 
a Benedictine monk and metalworker. Metalwork is the subject of the 
third hook of this treatise, following hooks on painting and stained glass. 
Theophilus’ text, written in the twelfth century, is the first in the 
Western tradition to give a pactitioner’s account of the technology of art 
poduction. 

Chapter 17: Laying Out Windows 

When you want to lay out glass windows, first make yourself a 
smooth flat wooden board. Then take a piece of chalk, scrape it with 
a knife all over the board, sprinkle water on it everywhere, and rub it 
all over with a cloth. When it has dried, take the measurements of one 
section in a window, and draw it on the board with a rule and com¬ 
passes. Draw as many figures as you wish, first with [a point made of] 
lead or tin, then with red or black pigment, making all the lines care¬ 
fully, because, when you have painted the glass, you will have to fit 
together the shadows and highlights in accordance with [the design 


on] the board. Then arrange the different kinds of robes and designate 
the color of each with a mark in its proper place; and indicate the 
color of anything else you want to paint with a letter. 

After this, take a lead pot and in it put chalk ground with water. 
Make yourself two or three brushes out of hair from the tail of a 
marten, badger, squirrel, or cat or from the mane of a donkey. Now 
take a piece of glass of whatever kind you have chosen, but larger on 
all sides than the place in which it is to be set, and lay it on the ground 
for that place. Then you will see the drawing on the board through 
the intervening glass, and, following it, draw the outlines only on the 
glass with chalk. 

Chapter 18: Glass Cutting 

Next heat on the fireplace an iron cutting tool, which should be thin 
everywhere except at the end, where it should be thicker. When the 
thicker part is red-hot, apply it to the glass that you want to cut, and 
soon there will appear the beginning of a crack. If the glass is hard 
[and does not crack at once], wet it with saliva on your finger in the 
place where you had applied the tool. It will immediately split and, as 
soon as it has, draw the tool along the line you want to cut and the 
split will follow.

BUTTRESSES In Chartres, as in Sugers choir at Saint-Denis, 
the buttresses (the heavy bones of the structural skeleton) are vis¬ 
ible only outside the building (figs. 12.15 and 12.16). The plan (see 
fig. 12.11) shows them as massive blocks of masonry that stick out 
from the building. Above the aisles, these piers turn into flying 
buttresses —arched bridges that reach upward to the critical spots 
between the clerestory windows where the outward thrust of the 
nave vault is concentrated (see fig. 12.16). The flying buttresses 
were also designed to resist the considerable wind pressure on the 
high-pitched roof. This method of anchoring vaults, so character¬ 
istic of Gothic architecture, certainly owed its origin to functional 
considerations, but the flying buttress is also an integral aesthetic 
and expressive feature of the building. Its shape could emphasize 
both verticality and support (in addition to actually providing it) 
in a variety of ways, according to the designer s sense of style. 

The masonry techniques involved in constructing cathedrals 
required both brute labor and skill. Freemasons, those who 
worked in freestone, which has a uniform texture and can be 
chiseled without breaking, carved the individual blocks and set 


them together to form walls, both outer and inner. The inter¬ 
mediate space was filled with mortar and rough stones, a task 
which the less skilled roughmasons performed. The inner and 
outer walls were connected by tie-courses of finished freestone, 
which gave added strength to the walls. 

STAINED GLASS Alone among all major Gothic cathedrals, 
Chartres still retains most of its more than 180 original stained- 
glass windows (fig. 12.17). The magic of the jewel-like light from 
the clerestory is unforgettable to anyone who has experienced it. 
The windows admit far less light than one might expect. They act 
mainly as diffusing filters that change the quality of daylight, 
giving it the poetic and symbolic values so highly praised by 
Abbot Suger. The sensation of ethereal light dissolves the physi¬ 
cal solidity of the church and, hence, the distinction between the 
temporal and the divine realms. This “miraculous light” creates 
the intensely mystical experience that lies at the heart of Gothic 
spirituality.

Chartres, ca. 1170 (framing panels are 13th century). Stained-glass 
window, height approx. 14' (4.27 m) 


The majestic Notre Dame de la Belle Verriere (literally, “Our 
Lady of the Beautiful Window”) at Chartres (fig. 12.18) appears 
as a weightless form hovering effortlessly in indeterminate space. 
This window, the only one apart from those of the west facade to 
survive the 1194 fire, consists of hundreds of small pieces of tinted 


glass held together by strips of lead. Methods of medieval glass¬ 
making limited the maximum size of these pieces, so the design 
could not simply be “painted on glass. ” Rather, the window was 
painted with glass. It was assembled much like a mosaic or a jig¬ 
saw puzzle, out of odd-shaped fragments cut to fit the contours 
of the shapes. (See Primary Source , page 402.) This process 
encourages an abstract, ornamental style, which tends to resist 
any attempt at three-dimensional effects. Only in the hands of a 
great master could the maze of lead strips lead to such monumen¬ 
tal forms. (See Materials and Technique s, page 405.) 

Given the way stained glass accentuates pattern and decorative 
effect, it is not surprising that it was so popular during the Middle 
Ages. Its brilliant surfaces are like the flat stones and enamel- 
work so highly prized in earlier periods (see fig. 10.2); enamel is 
in fact a kind of glass. The intensity with which the viewer 
engages with the image parallels the direct connection between 
viewer and object evident in much of the art of the earlier Middle 
Ages. Worthy comparisons with Notre Dame de la Belle Verriere 
are the Byzantine mosaics from the church of the Dormition at 
Daphni (see figs. 8.44 and 8.45) for the way they command our 
attention and communicate directly with a viewer. Both use 
otherworldly light to convey spiritual messages: on the one hand, 
filtered through stained glass, and on the other, reflected off gold- 
glass mosaics. 

The stained-glass workers who filled the windows of the great 
Gothic cathedrals also had to face difficulties arising from the 
enormous scale of their work. The task required a degree of 
orderly planning that had no precedent in medieval painting. 
Only architects and stonemasons knew how to deal with this 
problem, and it was their methods that the stained-glass workers 
borrowed in mapping out their own designs. Gothic architectural 
design relied on a system of geometric relationships to establish 
numerical harmony; the same rules could be used to control the 
design of stained-glass windows or even an individual figure. (See 
The Art Historian's Lens , page 406.) 

The drawings in a notebook compiled about 1240 by Villard 
de Honnecourt, who traveled widely and documented the major 
buildings he examined, provide some insight into this procedure. 
(See www.myartslab.com. ) What we see in his Wheel of Fortune 
(fig. 12.19) is not the final version of the design but the system of 
circles and triangles on which the artist based the image. It illus¬ 
trates the fundamental importance of such geometric schemes. 

TRANSEPTS AND THEIR SCULPTURE Each of the transept 
arms of Chartres cathedral has three deeply recessed and lavishly 
decorated portals, five lancets (tall, narrow windows crowned by 
a sharply pointed arch), and an immense rose window, the large 
medallion of glass in the center of the facade (see figs. 12.15 and 
12.17). The walls of these north and south facades have little solid¬ 
ity; they are so heavily pierced as to be nearly skeletal. On the ear¬ 
lier west facade, which holds the main entrance to the cathedral, 
the rose window, which was added after the 1194 fire, is com¬ 
posed of a grouping of holes cut out of the solid wall (see fig. 
12.4). By comparison, thin membranes hold the glass of the north 


404 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES 






Stained Glass 


C olored glass was not new in the thirteenth century, when it was 
used to spectacular effect in the windows of Gothic churches. It 
can be traced back more than 3,000 years to Egypt, and abundant evi¬ 
dence indicates that the Romans employed thin translucent sheets of 
glass in their buildings. Literary accounts, supported by some surviv¬ 
ing examples, also describe colored glass in Early Christian, Byzantine, 
Muslim, and early medieval buildings. 

In the twelfth-century artist’s handbook De diver sis artibus, the 
monk Theophilus Presbyter described in great detail the technique for 
making stained glass (see Primary Source, page 402). It required a 
molten mixture of silica (basically sand), potash (to lower the temper¬ 
ature at which silica melts), and lime (a stabilizer), plus the addition of 
metal oxides to color or “stain” the glass: The addition of cobalt oxide 
resulted in blue glass, copper oxide in red, and manganese oxide in 
purple. The glassworker heated the mixture in a wood-fired furnace 
and either poured it into molds to cool or shaped it by blowing air 
through a tube to form the soft glass mixture into an oval ball or cylin¬ 
der, which he then cut open and flattened. 

On a wooden board that had previously been covered with chalk, a 
designer created a drawing the same size as the window to be filled. 
Individual pieces of colored glass were cut with hot iron rods to fit the 
drawing and then arranged on it. Finer details, such as facial features 
and drapery folds, were then painted on with lead oxides, and the 
glass was placed in a wood-fired kiln to fuse the painted-on designs 
with the glass. Individual glass pieces were fitted together into mal¬ 
leable lead strips called cames. To permanently hold the composition 
in place, it was attached to an iron frame secured within the window 
opening. In the early twelfth century, the iron frame formed a grid of 
squares of about 2 feet on each side (see fig. 1 2.1 8). By the thirteenth 
century, glaziers employed complicated shapes, including circles, 
lozenges, and quatrefoils, to create increasingly complex designs (see 
fig. 12.32). 

Stained-glass production was a costly, time-consuming, and labor- 
intensive activity with a marked division of labor. The artisans who 


made the glass supported the work of the glaziers who designed and 
produced the windows. 

Although stained glass appears throughout Europe (see fig. 1 2.47), 
the most significant achievements in glass were made in northern 
Europe. To produce stained glass required abundant wood, both for 
firing the furnaces and kilns and for making potash, and it was in the 
north where there were sufficient forests to support a glassmaking 
industry. It was also in the north where the value of light entering a 
building could best be appreciated. 

The effect of multicolored refracted light playing off surfaces and 
across spaces virtually transforms Gothic buildings. Glaziers needed 
to consider how individual windows could harmoniously relate to the 
buildings that enframed them and to a larger iconographic and aes¬ 
thetic program. At Chartres, for example, blue glass predominates in 
the north transept rose window, while red, which admits less light, 
predominates in the southern rose window. Since southern light is 
much stronger than northern, the effect of the two roses is balanced 
in relation to the amount of natural light entering the building. Stained 
glass also provided the means to relate stories and images and to 
imbue them with metaphoric form. The thirteenth-century writer 
William Durandus of Mende, in his Rationale divinorum officiorum, 
wrote that “the windows of the church are the Holy Scriptures, which 
expel the wind and the rain, that is all things hurtful, but transmit the 
light of the true Sun, that is God, into the hearts of the faithful,” while 
St. Bernard of Clairvaux (see page 359) explained that light could pass 
through glass without damaging it, just as the word of God had pene¬ 
trated the womb of the Virgin Mary without violating it. 

By the late thirteenth century, the preference for colored glass had 
diminished and large areas of clear glass dominate church construction 
(see fig. 1 2.34). Where figures are employed, they remain quite vividly 
colored, but are isolated within large expanses of grayish grisaille 
glass, with yellow-stained glass used to represent architectural frames 
around the figures. This paler glass allows light to illuminate more fully 
the increasingly complex architectural details of later Gothic architecture.

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



Modules and Proportions 


st as musicologists have tried to reconstruct original performance 
ractice during the Middle Ages, so too architectural historians have 
tried to find the underlying systems that govern the design and 
construction of medieval buildings, so that they can understand the 
methods and intentions of medieval builders. How medieval architects 
and masons decided on the measurements and patterns they 
employed is a fascinating topic that has been explored by architectural 
historians since the nineteenth century. Few medieval documents 
explain how individual architects went about establishing the specific 
relationships they used, so scholars have to measure buildings and 
analyze those measurements in order to decipher the systems that 
were used to design them. The task is not always easy. The medieval 
yardstick was not the same in all regions, as it was the responsibility 
of local authorities to control measurement; so, for example, a specific 
measure in Paris was often different from the measure used in another 
French town. 

The most basic method of establishing a proportional order in build¬ 
ing was to either multiply or to divide a unit of measure, a system 
employed in the ninth century in the St. Gall monastery plan (see fig. 
1 0.22), and in later buildings, such as the cathedral of Santiago de 
Compostela (see fig. 11.3), where the square at the crossing of the 
nave is halved to determine the size of the nave bays and quartered 
for aisle bays. Medieval architects also employed more complicated 
proportional schemes. For example, by taking the diagonal of a square 
and rotating it, a designer could produce a rectangle with a consistent 
proportional relationship based on the square root of 2 (1.41 4); that 
is, the proportion of the shorter side of the rectangle to its longer 
side is 1:1.414. This proportional system had been used throughout 


antiquity, appearing: for example, in Vitruvius’ writings (see 
www.mvartslab.com) . The design tools an architect would have 
needed to produce shapes using these proportions were simply a right 
angle, a measuring rod, and a compass or a string, which could be 
used to rotate diagonals and thus form arches. 

Art historians have also attempted to understand the philosophical 
and symbolic significance of medieval systems of measurements. In 
his analysis of the Gothic cathedral, Otto von Simson described how 
St. Augustine—whose fifth-century writings were of singular impor¬ 
tance throughout the Middle Ages—saw modulation as producing a 
whole and perfect system that, in effect, reflects the order of the uni¬ 
verse. Augustine relies on the biblical description (Wisdom of Solomon 
11:21) of an omnipotent God who “hast ordered all things in measure, 
and number, and weight.” For Augustine, the employment of ratios in 
art, as well as in music, not only produces beauty but also allows us to 
appreciate the divine order. Architectural historians have demon¬ 
strated that figures from Platonic geometry, including the pentagon, 
the equilateral triangle, and the square, were also understood and 
employed by medieval builders. For Plato, these shapes were associ¬ 
ated with the elements that form the cosmos. Thus, once again, 
medieval architects found a physical system that expressed the perfec¬ 
tion and wholeness of the universe. 

Since the plans and elevations of Gothic cathedrals were viewed as 
mirrors of divine truths, these buildings can be appreciated as a union 
of engineering and theology, structure and meaning. Undoubtedly, for 
the medieval mind, the mathematics needed to plan medieval build¬ 
ings and the symbolism of the proportions and geometry employed 
were inseparable. 




rose in place. Art historians use the terms plate tracery and bar 
tracery to describe the different methods of composition 
employed here. With plate tracery the windows seem to be cut 
through solid stone walls, while in bar tracery, slender pieces of 
stone frame and hold in the colored glass. The bar tracery of the 
transept roses creates intricate decorative patterns and permits an 
increased amount of glass in relation to frame or wall surface. 

The north transept (fig. 12.20) is devoted to the Virgin Mary. 
She had already appeared over the right portal of the west facade 
in her traditional role as the Mother of God seated on the Throne 
of Divine Wisdom (see fig. 12.5). Her new prominence reflects the 
growing importance of the cult of the Virgin, which the Church 
had actively promoted since the Romanesque period. The growth 
of Mariology, as it is known, was linked to a new emphasis on 
divine love, embraced by the faithful as part of a more human 
view of Christianity that increased in popularity during the 
Gothic era. The cult of the Virgin at Chartres developed special 
meaning about 1204, when the cathedral received the head of her

mother, St. Anne, as a relic. This relic, in combination with the 
tunic of the Virgin that had miraculously survived the fire of a 
decade earlier, gave Chartres exceptional status among those 
devoted to Mary. 

The north tympanum of about 1210 depicts events associated 
with the Feast of the Assumption, when Mary was transported to 
Heaven (fig. 12.21). These events are the Death (Dormition), 
Assumption, and Coronation of the Virgin, which, along with the 
Annunciation, became the most frequently portrayed subjects 
relating to her life. They rely on theological interpretations that 
identify Mary with the Church as the Bride of Christ and the 
Gateway to Heaven, in addition to her traditional role as divine 
intercessor. She becomes not only Christ s companion, but also 
his queen. Unlike earlier representations, many of which rely on 
Byzantine examples, these are of Western invention. The figures 
have a monumentality never found before in medieval sculpture. 
Moreover, the treatment is so pictorial that the scenes are inde¬ 
pendent of the architectural setting into which they are crammed. 

Whereas the Coronation of the Virgin represents a relatively 
early phase of High Gothic sculpture, the jamb statues of the 
transept portals show a discernible evolution, even among them¬ 
selves since they were carved at different times. The relationship

12.22 Jamb statues, south transept portal of cathedral of Notre-Dame, 
Chartres, ca. 1215-20. Left-most figure (St. Theodore) ca. 1230 


between statue and column begins to dissolve. The columns are 
quite literally put in the shade by the greater width of the figures, 
by the strongly projecting canopies, and by the elaborately carved 
bases of the statues. 

A good instance of this early dissolution of the relationship 
between statues and columns is seen on one of the south transept 
portal jambs (fig. 12.22). The three saints on the right (Lawrence, 
Clement, and Stephen) still echo the cylindrical shape of Early 
Gothic jamb statues (see fig. 12.6), though the heads are no longer 
strictly in line with the central axis of the body By comparison, 
the knight on the left, St. Theodore, who was carved about ten 
or fifteen years later, stands at ease, in a semblance of classical 
contrapposto. His feet rest on a horizontal platform, rather than on 
a sloping shelf as before, and the axis of his body, instead of being 
straight, describes a slight but perceptible S-curve. Even more 
surprising is the wealth of carefully observed detail in his weapons 
and in the texture of his tunic and chain mail. Above all, there is 
the organic structure of the body Not since imperial Roman 
times (see fig. 7.29) have we seen a figure that so convincingly 


suggests the organic structure of a human body. Yet the most 
impressive quality of the St. Theodore statue is not its naturalism 
but the sense of serenity and balance that it conveys. This ideal 
portrait of the Christian soldier, dressed as a contemporary war¬ 
rior, expresses the spirit of the crusades in its most elevated form. 


Amiens Cathedral 

The High Gothic style defined at Chartres reaches its climax a 
generation later in the interior of Amiens cathedral (figs. 12.23 
and 12.24). Amiens was begun in 1220, two years after a fire 
destroyed an earlier cathedral on the site and while Chartres was 
still under construction; the nave was vaulted by 1236 and work 
on the choir continued for another 25 years. It is significant 
that we know the names of the cathedrals architects, Robert 
de Luzarches, Thomas de Cormont, and his son Renaud de 
Cormont, since it indicates the heightened social status of 
Gothic builders. 

NAVE The breathtaking height of the nave (fig. 12.24) is the 
dominant achievement both technically and aesthetically at 
Amiens. We can see clearly the relatively swift and continuous 
progression toward verticality in French Gothic cathedral archi¬ 
tecture by comparing the nave elevations of the Early Gothic 
cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris and the High Gothic cathedrals 
of Chartres and Amiens (fig. 12.25). The height of the Amiens 
nave arcade, greatly increased in proportion to the rest of the 
wall, creates a soaring effect; it alone is almost as high (70 feet) as 
the entire four-story elevation of Laon (78 feet). The complete 
nave rises 140 feet above the ground, while that at Chartres meas¬ 
ures “only” 118 feet from floor to vault. Moreover, the width of 
the Amiens nave is narrower in proportion to its height; at Paris, 
the ratio of nave width to height is 1:2.2 and at Chartres 1:2.4, 
while at Amiens it is 1:3. Thus, the effect of soaring verticality 
increased in direct proportion to the apparent narrowing of the 
nave. There is also increased vertical integration through the use 
of shafts that rise directly through the capitals of the piers. 
Moreover, the triforium and clerestory are connected visually by 
means of a central colonnette, so that the entire wall above the 
nave arcade is pulled together vertically. At Amiens, the vaults are 
as taut and thin as membranes; skeletal construction is carried to 
its virtual limits. 


Reims Cathedral 

We can trace the same emphasis on verticality and translucency in 
the development of the High Gothic facade. The one at Reims 
cathedral makes an instructive contrast with Notre-Dame in 
Paris, even though it was designed only about 30 years later. 
Reims, as the coronation cathedral of the kings of France, was 
closely linked to Paris, where the kings held court. The two share 
many elements, including broad transepts that extend out from 
the body of the church only slightly, but they have been reshaped 
into very different ensembles (fig. 12.26).

WEST FACADE The portals on the west facade of Reims cathe¬ 
dral (fig. 12.27), instead of being recessed as in Paris (see fig. 
12.10), project forward as gabled porches, with windows in place 
of tympana above the doorways. The gallery of royal statues, 
which in Paris forms a horizontal band between the first and 
second stories, has been raised in Reims until it merges with the 
third-story arcade. Every detail except the rose window has 
become taller and narrower than before. Pinnacles (small pointed 
elements capping piers, buttresses, and other architectural forms) 
everywhere accentuate restless upward movement. The sculptural 
decoration, by far the most lavish of its kind, no longer remains in 
clearly marked-off zones, but has now spread to so many new 
perches, not only on the facade but on the flanks of the edifice as 
well, that the exterior begins to look like a dovecote for statues. 

WEST PORTAL SCULPTURE The jamb figures at Reims are 
not in their original positions because some sculptures were 
moved between the west facade and the transept portals. As a 
result, continuity of style and program is difficult to assess. 
However, we can study here individual sculptures of distinctive 
style and high quality. Gothic classicism (see page 408) reached

Notre-Dame, Reims, ca. 1230-65 


Roman presence in Reims, and excavations during the last century 
established that the first cathedral on the site was built over 
Roman baths. That Roman models might have been available to 
the Reims sculptors is thus a real possibility. 

Because of the vast scale and time frame of the sculptural pro¬ 
gram at Reims (and at other cathedrals as well), it was necessary 
to employ a variety of sculptors working in distinct styles. Two of 
these styles, both clearly different from the classicism of the 
Visitation , appear in the Annunciation group (see fig. 12.28, the 
two figures on the left). The difference in style within a single 
group derives from the fact that the angel Gabriel and the Virgin 
were not originally intended as a pair, but were only later installed 
next to each other. The Virgin, from between 1240 and 1245, has 
a rigidly vertical axis, and her garments form straight, tubular 
folds meeting at sharp angles. This severe style was probably 
developed about 1220 by the sculptors of the west portals of 
Notre-Dame in Paris; from there, it traveled to Reims as well as 
Amiens. The angel, in contrast, is remarkably graceful and was 
carved at least a decade later than the Virgin of the Annunciation , 
between 1255 and 1265. Features such as the tiny, round face 
framed by curly locks, the emphatic smile, the strong S-curve of 
the slender body, and the rich drapery of this "elegant style” 
spread far and wide during the following decades. In fact, the 
style soon became the standard formula for Gothic sculpture. Its 
effect will be seen for many years to come, not only in France but 
also abroad. 

RELIEF SCULPTURE A mature example of the elegant style is 
the group of Melchizedek and Abraham (fig. 12.29), carved 
shortly after the middle of the thirteenth century, for the interior 
west wall of Reims cathedral. These sculptures were probably 


its climax in some of these Reims statues. The most famous of 
them is the Visitation group (fig. 12.28, the two figures on the 
right), which was carved between 1230 and 1233. It depicts the 
Virgin Mary announcing the news of her pregnancy to her cousin 
Elizabeth. 

For a pair of jamb figures to enact a narrative scene such as this 
would have been inconceivable in Early Gothic sculpture, where 
individual figures remained isolated, even within unified pro¬ 
grams. That the Visitation figures are now free to interact shows 
how far the column has receded into the background. The 
S-curve, resulting from the pronounced contrapposto, is much 
more obvious here than in the St. Theodore from Chartres (see 
fig. 12.22) and dominates both the side and front views of the 
figures. The figures gesture at each other as they communicate 
across the space that separates them, an engagement with open 
space that recalls the more active role taken on by space in High 
Gothic architecture, too. 

Horizontal folds of cloth pulled across the womens 
abdomens emphasize the physical bulk of their bodies. Mary and 
Elizabeth remind us so strongly of ancient Roman matrons that 
we might wonder if the artist was inspired by large-scale Roman 
sculpture (compare fig. 7.35). A surviving gate attests to an earlier

and Abraham , interior

CHAPTER 12 GOTHIC ART 411 
















conceived in relation to the royal coronation ceremonies held in 
the cathedral. Abraham and Melchizedek were chosen as subjects 
because, as described in Genesis 14:18-20 in the Hebrew Bible, 
they are sacred leaders. The meaning relayed here expands on 
ideas expressed in the jamb statues of Chartres cathedrals 
west facade, where parallels are drawn between biblical royalty 
and the kings and queens of France (see page 396). The Reims 
scene emphasizes that earthly power is conferred through and 
in the service of the Church and that the archbishop of Reims, 
who anointed new kings, bestowed on them the lawful rite to 
rule as sovereign Christian monarchs. Abraham s costume, that 
of a medieval knight, would undoubtedly have encouraged the 
thirteenth-century viewer to draw parallels with the reigning 
monarch. 

The carving of the figures recalls the vigorous realism of the St. 
Theodore at Chartres (see fig. 12.22) in the attention the sculptor 
invested in his garments and trappings. Melchizedek, however, 
shows clearly his proximity to the angel of the Reims 
Annunciation (see fig. 12.28) in his even more elaborately curled 
hair and beard, and the ample draperies that nearly swallow his 
body among the play of folds. Deep recesses and sharply project¬ 
ing ridges show a new awareness of the effects of light and 
shadow that are as pictorial as they are sculptural. This pictorial- 
ism is also apparent in the way the figures interact, despite being 
placed in deep niches. The realism of the figures is heightened 
by the foliage that occupies the framing elements around them, 


representing specific and recognizable plants, which include oak 
and fig leaves as well as acorns. 

References to the increasing realism of Gothic sculpture need 
qualification, since Gothic realism was never systematic. Rather, it 
was a realism of particulars, focused on specific details rather than 
on overall structure. Its most characteristic products are not only 
the classically oriented jamb statues and tympanum compositions 
of the early and mid-thirteenth century, but also small-scale 
carvings, such as the Labors of the Months and the Signs of the 
Zodiac in quatrefoil (four-lobed) frames on the facade of Amiens 
cathedral (fig. 12.30). The same subjects appear on Romanesque 
(see page 362) and Early Gothic portals (see page 396), but at 
Amiens they demonstrate a delightful observation of everyday 
life. The sculptor was clever in arranging individual scenes 
within the decorative quatrefoils, a shape difficult to master 
compositionally. 

The High Gothic cathedrals of France represent a concen¬ 
trated effort rarely seen before or since. The huge cost of these 
truly national monuments was borne by donations and taxes 
collected from all over the country and from all classes of society. 
These cathedrals express the merging of religious and patriotic 
fervor that had been Abbot Suger s goal. However, the great 
expense and forced taxation required to construct these buildings 
did produce vehement objections. In 1233, for example, construc¬ 
tion of Reims cathedral was suspended as a result of civil unrest 
directed against the cathedral authorities and was not resumed for

three years. This cessation of building activity helps explain the 
variety of styles at Reims. By the middle of the thirteenth century 
the wave of enthusiasm for large-scale projects had passed its 
peak. Work on the vast structures now proceeded at a slower 
pace. New projects were fewer and generally far less ambitious. 
As a result, the highly organized teams of masons and sculptors 
that had formed at the sites of the great cathedrals during the 
preceding decades gradually broke up into smaller units. 


RAYONNANT OR COURT STYLE 


One of those who still had the will and means to build on an 
impressive scale during the mid-thirteenth century was King 
Louis IX (known as St. Louis following his canonization in 1297, 
fewer than 30 years after his death). Under the king’s governance 
and as a result of a treaty with the English that resulted in French 
control of Normandy, the map of Louiss possessions began to 
take on the shape of present-day France. The increasing impor¬ 
tance of the monarchy and the rising importance of Paris, where 
the court was located, is reflected in the degree to which Louis 
was able to define a court style, manifest as an appreciation of 
visual elegance and material luxury, which was favored as well by 
the upper echelons of aristocratic society. Our sense of Paris as an 
artistic center effectively begins under St. Louis. 


Sainte-Chapelle 

St. Louis’s mark on the stylistic evolution of Gothic is most 
dramatically seen in his court chapel, called the Sainte-Chapelle, 
which was designed by 1241 and completed within seven years 
(fig. 12.31). The two-story building comprises a ground floor, a 
relatively low chapel for court officials, and an upper floor to 
which the royal family had direct access from their quarters in the 
palace. In essence, the building is a type of palatine chapel for 
which Charlemagne’s building at Aachen (see fig. 10.18) serves as 
an early prototype. 

The impetus for the building was provided by Louis’s acquisi¬ 
tion from his cousin, the emperor of Constantinople, of the 
Crown of Thorns and other relics of Christ’s Passion, including a 
part of the True Cross, the iron lance, the sponge, and a nail. Such 
sacred relics required a glorious space for their display. Rich col¬ 
ors, elaborate patterns, and extensive amounts of gold, largely 
restored in the nineteenth century, cover the Sainte-Chapelle s 
walls, vaults, and other structural members (fig. 12.32). This dec¬ 
oration complements the stained glass that constitutes most of the 
surface of the chapel. The stained-glass windows concentrate on 
historical and biblical scenes that prefigure the sacred kingship of 
French monarchs. Above the altar, an elevated shrine, destined to 
frame the sacred relics, was left open at the back so that filtered 
light would bathe the venerated objects on display. The delicate 
glass cage of the building, jewel-like in the intensity of the colored 
light that enters it, functions in effect as a monumental reliquary. 
The tall, thin lancets accentuate verticality to such a degree that

THE MIDDLE AGES 





















the building conveys a sense of monumentality comparable to any 
cathedral despite its diminutive scale. On entering, a viewer is vir¬ 
tually immersed in its aura of light, different from any normal 
experience of the physical world. Thus, as with Hagia Sophia (see 
pages 257-60), spirituality is made manifest through the material¬ 
ity of architecture and its decoration. 

The Sainte-Chapelle s exterior buttresses are relatively modest 
in scale, given the great amount of glass and the large size of the 
windows in proportion to the walls (see fig. 12.31). By keeping 
the buttresses close to the building, the builders kept to a mini¬ 
mum the shadows cast across the windows. In order to withstand 
the physical forces usually contained by more prominent but¬ 
tresses, two horizontal iron chains passing across the chapel s 
windows reinforce the structure, a remarkably effective solution 
to the structural and aesthetic problems the builders faced. 

This phase of Gothic is often referred to as rayonnant, from 
the French rayonner , “to radiate light. ” The term derives from the 
prevalence of raylike bar tracery in buildings of the period, which 
originally appeared in rose windows and later began to appear 


throughout entire churches. The style, closely associated with the 
court, spread through the French royal domain and then through 
much of Europe. 

Saint-U rbain in Troyes 

Saint-Urbain in Troyes (figs. 12.33 and 12.34), built during the 
later years of the thirteenth century, was commissioned by Pope 
Urban IV (r. 1261-1264) to mark his birthplace and was dedicated 
to his patron saint. By eliminating the triforium and simplifying 
the plan, the designer created a delicate glass cage of only two 
stories; the slightly larger upper one is virtually all glass, much of 
it clear. The delicate tracery of the choir windows, which begin 
only 10 feet above the floor, emphasizes the effect of a screen 
dematerialized by light. Flying buttresses so thin as to be hardly 
noticeable support the building. The same spiny elegance charac¬ 
terizes the architectural ornament: Gables are fully detached from 
the window walls they are designed to support. The delicacy of 
Saint-Urbain leaves no doubt that the heroic age of the Gothic

style is past. Refinement of detail, rather than monumentality, is 
now the chief concern. 

Manuscript Illumination 

Some authors have been concerned that the term “rayonnant” is 
appropriate only for architecture. Recognizing that there were 
also major achievements in the pictorial arts within Louis IX s 
court and in the upper echelons of aristocratic society, they prefer 
the term court style, which they use synonymously with rayon¬ 
nant to define the art of this time. In fact, there are many connec¬ 
tions between the building arts and the elaborate devotional 
works with exquisite miniatures produced for the personal enjoy¬ 
ment and education of the royal family and for others who were 
literate and could afford them. These products of French manu¬ 
script workshops disseminated the refined taste that made the 
court art of Paris the standard for all Europe. 


PSALTER OF BLANCHE OF CASTILE A psalter executed 
around 1230 for Blanche of Castile, mother of King Louis IX, 
shows these connections. The psalter (fig. 12.35) was probably 
made during the period when Blanche served as regent (1226-34) 
for Louis, who had inherited the throne at age 12 and could not 
reign in his own right for another six years. The range and inten¬ 
sity of colors (particularly of red and blue), the heavy outlines, 
and the placement of scenes within geometric shapes—here inter¬ 
locked circles and semicircles—recall the treatment and arrange¬ 
ment of stained glass seen, for example, behind the shrine at 
Sainte-Chapelle (see fig. 12.32). The polished gold background of 
the illuminated page creates a dazzling display, not unlike the 
effect of light transmitted through glass or reflected from the 
metal surface of a reliquary. 

BIBLE MORALISEE A new type of bible, the moralized Bible

visual and textual, either in Latin or French, intended to make the 
biblical accounts more relevant to contemporary viewers. The 
form demonstrates a will to instruct, and the use of the vernacu¬ 
lar French suggests its use by nonclerical persons. It is not sur¬ 
prising, given the didactic quality of the moralized Bible, that its 
creation in Paris is coeval with the emergence there of the univer¬ 
sity as an institution. The manuscript illustrated here (fig. 12.36) 
is a few years later than the original one and divided between the 
cathedral of Toledo, in Spain, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, in 
New York, and originally comprised nearly 3,000 illustrated pages. 

These bibles were made for the personal use of the kings and 
queens of France and perhaps for other high-ranking persons as 
well. They were intended both as precious objects and guides for 
good conduct, treating important issues of the time, such as 
heresy, sex, and the behavior of rulers. The moralizing tone of 
these instructional guides is very much in keeping with the char¬ 
acter and accomplishments of the pious and compassionate King 
Louis, guided by Blanche, his powerful and involved mother. The 
scenes on the page shown here are arranged in vertically stacked 
roundels, and once again the tall and narrow windows of the 


12.37 Melchizedek and Abraham , from the Psalter of St. Louis. 1253-70.

Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris 


Sainte-Chapelle (see fig. 12.32) offer a particularly clear parallel. 
The spaces around the roundels in the manuscript abound with 
flourishes and checkerboard or diaper patterns of repeated dia¬ 
monds, analogous to the decoration surrounding the scenes in the 
Sainte-Chapelle windows. 

PSALTER OF ST. LOUIS Perhaps the closest parallel 
between painting and architectural form is the Psalter of St. Louis , 
which was executed in the 1260s (fig. 12.37). The folio reproduced 
here illustrates the same Genesis scene of Abraham and 
Melchizedek as is represented on the interior of Reims cathedral 
(see fig. 12.29). Abraham and his troops wear crusader armor, 
establishing an association between contemporary struggles to 
free Christian lands and heroic biblical events. Louis was an eager 
warrior for Christianity who organized and participated in two 
crusades, in 1254 and 1270, the latter being the occasion of his 
death in Tunisia. The gold background and the banks of clouds

that waft around the arcades, hovering like incense in a church, 
accentuate the sacral aspects of the representation. 

The manuscript s painted architecture is modeled directly on 
the Sainte-Chapelle (see fig. 12.31). The illustration also recalls the 
canopies above the heads of jamb statues at Chartres (see fig. 
12.22) and the arched twin niches that enclose the Reims relief of 
Abraham and Melchizedek (see fig. 12.29). Against the two- 
dimensional background of the page, the figures stand out in relief 
by their smooth and skillful modeling. The outer contours are 
defined by heavy, dark lines, once again like the lead strips in 
stained-glass windows. The figures themselves display all the 
features of the elegant style seen in Gothic sculpture: graceful 
gestures, swaying poses, smiling faces, and neatly waved hair. 
(Compare the Annunciation angel in fig. 12.28 and Melchizedek 
and Abraham in fig. 12.29.) This miniature thus exemplifies the 
refined taste of the court art of Paris. 


LATE GOTHIC ART IN FRANCE 

Although Late Gothic art builds on earlier achievements, during 
this period artists felt free to deviate from previous patterns 
of development. Builders showed increased concern for unity of 
plan, but they also employed curvilinear and elaborate decorative 
forms that often showed little concern for the clarity of structure 
so important in earlier Gothic works. Elaborate arrangements 
of overlapping and pierced planes produced complex visual 
displays. Late Gothic manuscripts and sculptures are also highly 
decorated and are rich in surface treatment, accentuating their 
precious qualities. 


Manuscript Illumination 

A notably broader audience for books was stimulated by the 
Fourth Lateran Council, which met in Rome in 1215 and aimed 
to increase general Christian education. Until the thirteenth 
century, illuminated manuscripts had been produced in monastic 
scriptoria. Now, along with many other activities that were once 
the special preserve of the clergy, manuscript production shifted 
to urban workshops organized by laypeople, the ancestors of 
the publishing houses of today. Here again, the workshops of 
sculptors and stained-glass painters may have set the pattern. 
Paris was renowned as a center of manuscript production, and 
it is possible even today to identify the streets on which the work¬ 
shops were clustered. 

PRAYER BOOK OF PHILIP IV THE FAIR Some of these 
new, secular illuminators are known to us by name. Among them 
is Master Honore of Paris, who in 1296 painted the miniatures 
in the Prayer Book ofPhilip TV the Fair (fig. 12.38), commissioned 
by the grandson of Louis IX and designed for use in the 
Sainte-Chapelle. Master Honore was a well-remunerated artist: in 
1292, he paid higher taxes than any other member of the Paris 
guild of miniature painters. (The guild was an association of 



12.38 Master Honore, David and Goliath , from the Prayer Book 
of Philip TV the Fair. 1296. Ink and tempera on vellum,

craftsmen engaged in a particular trade, formed to maintain 
standards and protect common interests.) The University of Paris 
commissioned his workshop to produce illuminated copies of 
ecclesiastical law. Our illustration shows him working in a style 
derived from the Psalter of St. Louis (see fig. 12.37). Here, how¬ 
ever, the framework no longer dominates the composition. The 
figures have become larger and their relieflike modeling more 
pronounced, an effect achieved through gentle shifts of color and 
modulated white highlights, quite different from the flat planes 
of color so characteristic of earlier manuscripts. The figures, 
though active and engaging, do not appear to stand comfortably, 
since their turned-down feet are flattened against the page. 
However, the figures are allowed to overlap the frame, which 
helps to detach them from the flat pattern of the background and

thus introduces a certain, though very limited, depth into the 
picture. The implication of space helps further the storytelling 
quality of the representation. In the lower scene, David and 
Goliath each appear twice; in an expressive detail, Goliath, as if in 
distress, brings his hand to his forehead even before David has 
released his shot. 

HOURS OF JEANNE D’EVREUX The interest in depicting 
sculptural figures was further developed by the illuminator Jean 
Pucelle in a prayer book—called a book of hours—illuminated in 
Paris between 1324 and 1328 for Jeanne d’Evreux, queen of 
France (fig. 12.39) and probably a gift from her husband, the king. 
A book of hours was used for private prayer and contained the 
devotions for the seven canonical hours of the day as well as 
liturgy for local saints; often a calendar was also included. The 
book, only 3 1 /i nc lies high, is jewel-like, fitting for the private use 
of a queen. The Annunciation is represented on the right-hand 
page and the Betrayal of Jesus on the left. The style of the figures 
recalls Master Honore (see fig. 12.38), but the delicate grisaille 
(painting in gray) adds a soft roundness to the forms, the 
enhanced shading conveying a heightened sense of relief. This is 
not Pucelle s only contribution: The architectural interior reveals 


a spatial recession previously unknown in northern European 
painting. In the Annunciation , Gabriel kneels in an anteroom, 
while angels appear in the windows of an attic, from which the 
dove of the Holy Spirit descends. 

In representing this new pictorial space, Jean Pucelle had to 
take into account the special needs of a manuscript page. The 
Virgin’s chamber does not fill the entire picture surface. It is as 
though it were an airy cage floating on the blank background 
(note the supporting angel on the right), like the rest of the orna¬ 
mental framework, so that the entire page forms a harmonious 
unit. Many of the details are peripheral to the religious purpose of 
the manuscript. The kneeling queen inside the initial D is surely 
meant to be Jeanne d’Evreux at her prayers; it is as if her intense 
devotions have produced a tangible vision of the Annunciation. 
The identity of the man with the staff next to her is unclear, 
although he appears to be a courtier listening to the lute player 
perched on the tendril above him. The combination of scenes is a 
commentary on experiences that become real even if they lack 
physical substance: Music is at once actual and ephemeral, as is 
Jeanne’s religious vision. 

Other enchanting vignettes (small decorative or ornamental 
designs or scenes) fill the page. A rabbit peers from its burrow 


CHAPTER 12 GOTHIC ART 419 


































beneath the girl on the left, and in the foliage leading up to the 
initial we find a monkey and a squirrel. These fanciful marginal 
designs—or droleries—are a common feature of Northern 
Gothic manuscripts. They originated more than a century before 
Jean Pucelle in the regions along the English Channel. From there 
they quickly spread to Paris and the other centers of Gothic art. 
Their subjects include a wide range of motifs: fantasy, fable, and 
grotesque humor, as well as scenes of everyday life, which appear 
side by side with religious themes. The essence of drolerie is its 
playfulness. In this special domain, the artist enjoys an almost 
unlimited freedom—comparable to a jester s—which accounts for 
the wide appeal of droleries during the later Middle Ages. 

The seeming innocence of Pucelles droleries nevertheless 
hides a serious purpose, which is particularly evident in the exam¬ 
ple at the bottom of the right-hand page, a type of illustration 
referred to as a bas-de-page (French for “bottom of the page”). 
The four figures are playing a game of tag called Froggy in the 
Middle, a reference to the Betrayal of Jesus on the opposite page. 
Below the latter scene, two knights on goats joust at a barrel. This 
image not only mocks courtly chivalry but also refers to Jesus as 
a “scapegoat,” and to the spear that pierced his side at the 
Crucifixion. The scapegoat refers to the Hebrew Bible description 
(Feviticus 16) of a goat that would bear the blame for all the sins 
and transgressions of the people, a fitting parallel to Christ s 
suffering and redemptive death. 

LE DIT DU LION (THE ENCHANTED GARDEN) The 

nature of manuscript production (see page 418) in independent 
lay workshops and the increasing use of the vernacular (see pages 



1 2.40 Guillaume de Machaut. The Enchanted Garden , from 
Le Dit du Lion. 1350-55. Ink, tempera, and gold leaf on vellum, 
11Vx 8 1 / (30 x 21 cm). Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris 


390 and 417) resulted in the introduction of new modes of expres¬ 
sion and subjects of interest to a secular audience. An instructive 
example is one of the first true European landscapes created 
to illustrate a passage of the poem Le Dit du Lion (fig. 12.40) 
by Guillaume de Machaut of around 1350. The Dit (literally 
“spoken”) indicates that it was not meant to be sung; the French 
poem describes an enchanted garden seen by a lover who is visit¬ 
ing an adjacent castle. The scene accurately illustrates several 
verses of the poem including the delightful lines: 

To make their pleasing melody 

Birds are sitting in a tree 

One, two, five, and even six I see. 

The cool colors, flickering highlights, and charmingly depicted 
details of flora and fauna convey a sense of carefully observed 
nature and a feeling for illusionistic space. 

Guillaume de Machaut, the first composer of polyphonic 
music whom we know by name, seems to have personally super¬ 
vised the production of manuscripts of his works, which 
included, in addition to poetry, both sacred and secular music. 
This reflects the important role books played during this period, 
that is, when they were becoming accessible to a broader public. 
Machaut s interest in how his works were presented indicates 
pride and self-awareness on the part of a writer and musician to 
parallel what we have already seen of Gothic artists and architects 
(see page 399). 

Sculpture 

Portal sculpture, the principal interest of the Early and High 
Gothic periods, is of relatively little consequence during the Fate 
Gothic period. Single figures, carved in the round, many of them 
cult figures, are now fully detached from any architectural setting. 
As the individual s importance in society increased, so individual 
sculpted figures became more prominent. Sculptors’ guilds were 
now well established. Two guild masters, appointed by the king, 
guaranteed that sculptors would fulfill the statutes that governed 
their corporation. In addition to stone carving, sculptors pro¬ 
duced a significant number of precious objects in metal and ivory. 

VIRGIN OF JEANNE D’EVREUX Pucelles Virgin of the 
Annunciation (see fig. 12.39), with its poised elegance, has a 
remarkable counterpart in the silver-gilt statue that the same 
patron offered to the abbey of Saint-Denis in 1339 (fig. 12.41). 
The elegance and refinement of the Virgin of Jeanne d’Evreux 
reminds us that metalwork—so significant during the earlier 
Middle Ages—continued to be a valued medium. Even during the 
Early Gothic period, Abbot Suger made clear the funds that 
patrons were willing to invest in reliquaries, shrines, altar embell¬ 
ishments, and liturgical vessels: It has been calculated that the 
reliquary designed for the Crown of Thorns cost more than twice 
the construction expenses of the Sainte-Chapelle, which was built 
to house it.

In the Virgin of Jeanne d’Evreux , the graceful sway of the 
Virgins body is counterbalanced by the harmonious way in 
which the drapery’s vertical folds and soft curves play off each 
other. The Christ Child touches his mother s lips in a gesture both 
delicate and intimate. The inscription on the base of the statue 
recording the royal gift and the fleur-de-lis , symbol of French 
royalty, held by the Virgin, associate her royal stature with that of 
the donor. 


VIRGIN OF PARIS In another early fourteenth-century 
sculpture of the Virgin, we see how traces of classicism increas¬ 
ingly disappear from Gothic sculpture, while elegance becomes a 
virtual end in itself. Thus, the human figure of the Virgin of Paris 
(fig. 12.42) in Notre-Dame cathedral is now strangely abstract. It 
consists largely of hollows, and the projections are so reduced 



1 2.42 Virgin of Paris. Early 14th century. Stone. 
Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Paris 


CHAPTER 1 2 GOTHIC ART 421 













that a viewer sees them as lines rather than volumes. The statue is 
quite literally disembodied—its swaying stance bears little 
relation to Classical contrapposto , since it no longer supports the 
figure. Compared to such unearthly grace, the angel of the Reims 
Annunciation (see fig. 12.28) seems solid indeed; yet it contains 
the seed of the very qualities expressed so strikingly in the Virgin 
of Paris. Earlier instances of Gothic naturalism (see page 412), 
which focused on particulars, survive here as a kind of intimate 
realism in which the infant Christ is no longer a Savior-in- 
miniature facing the viewer but, rather, a human child playing 
with his mother’s veil. 

The elegant manner of this new style was encouraged by the 
royal court of France and thus had special authority. It is this 
graceful expressive quality, not realism or classicism, that is the 
essence of Gothic art. These Late Gothic sculptures might lack 
the epic quality of Early Gothic sculpture, but they are still 
impressive and relate to Late Gothic art in other mediums, such 
as ivory, as we shall now see. 

SIEGE OF THE CASTLE OF LOVE The Virgin of Jeanne 
d’Evreux and the Virgin of Paris were made for a sophisticated 
audience that valued elegant and luxurious objects. These patrons 
also commissioned secular articles for their own use, many of 
which were made by the same artists who created religious 
images. Objects, in precious materials such as ivory, were often 
decorated with scenes from the romantic courtly literature that 
was popular at the time. These stories were recounted by trouba¬ 
dours, whose favorite subjects were the sweetness and the bitter¬ 
ness of love. The Siege of the Castle of Love (fig. 12.43) is depicted 
on a fourteenth-century ivory mirror back, which originally held 
a polished metal disk on its other side. Knights, some on horse¬ 
back, attack a castle inhabited by women. However, by conscious 
design the battle lacks intensity, since the equestrian at the left is 
more concerned with the women in the castle, who toss roses at 
their attackers, than he is with the combat taking place in front of 
him. At the upper right, a knight scales the castle walls, helped up 
by a lady within it. On the other side, a soldier climbs a tree in 
order to surrender his sword to a woman armed with roses. 

The scene depicted is remarkably close to the thirteenth- 
century poem Roman de la Rose (Romance of the Rose), written in 
vernacular French by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meung, in 
which a knight and his colleagues assault the Castle of Love. The 
fairy-tale quality of the ivory reflects the images in the poem, 
which describe a dream sequence. The story is an allegory, with 
the castle symbolizing women and the attack upon it a form of 
courtship. Thus, even if the battle represented here is a mock one, 
all parties have something to gain from it. 

The courtly subject with women as its focus is clearly appro¬ 
priate for a mirror, since it is put to use in the cause of female 
personal adornment. Small mirrors like this were carried by their 
owners, some suspended from belts. It was only in the twelfth 
century that cosmetics were reintroduced to western Europe. 
Although they had been in common use in antiquity, they 
had fallen out of use after the fall of Rome. Crusaders helped 


reestablish the habit of applying cosmetics as a result of their 
contact with the eastern Mediterranean, where the custom had 
continued from antiquity. 

This ivory was made in Paris, where a guild of makers of ivory 
combs and mirrors is documented at this time. Both the function 
and subject of the mirror back suggest a social context in which 
the reading of romances and the appreciation of luxury objects are 
linked. Some years later, though still within the fourteenth 
century, the account book of a French duke records his purchase 
from a Parisian dealer of an ivory mirror and six wooden candle¬ 
sticks “so that he could read romances. ” The production of lux¬ 
ury ivories trails off after the middle of the fourteenth century, a 
result of the economic turmoil precipitated by the Hundred 
Years’ War. 

Architecture: The Flamboyant Phase 

Although the beginnings of the Late, or Flamboyant, phase of 
Gothic architecture go back to the late thirteenth century, during 
the Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) artistic production dimin¬ 
ished significantly. Hence, we do not meet any full-fledged exam¬ 
ples of Flamboyant art until the early fifteenth century. 
Flamboyant, literally meaning “flamelike” in French, refers to 
the undulating curves and reverse curves that are a main feature of 
Late Gothic bar tracery. Structurally, Flamboyant Gothic shows 
few significant developments of its own.

SAINT-MACLOU IN ROUEN What distinguishes Saint- 
Maclou at Rouen (fig. 12.44) from Saint-Urbain at Troyes (see fig. 
12.33) is the profusion of its ornament, which clearly announces 
the Flamboyant style. The church was designed by Pierre Robin 
in 1434; Ambroise Harel directed the workshop from 1467 to 
1480, during which time a substantial portion of the west facade 
was built, although it was not completed until around 1490. The 
facade curves back on either side, allowing the central portal to 
project outward, establishing a hierarchy of forms, which varia¬ 
tions in height accentuate. 

Harel covered Saint-Maclou s structural skeleton with a web 
of decoration so dense and fanciful as almost to hide it completely. 
To locate the bones of the building within this picturesque tangle 
of lines becomes a fascinating game of hide-and-seek. Even a 
careful examination of the building s exterior does not help to 
decipher its interior arrangement. Repeated motifs, such as the 
pointed gable, appear both to emerge from the building and to 
soar above it. It is through the central gable, rather than above it, 
that the rose window appears. The gable, previously an element of 
enclosure (see figs. 12.20 and 12.27), is now so eaten into by shim¬ 
mering tracery that it has become a purely decorative form used 
to create a lively if unsettling effect. The activation of architectural 
forms through spatial means is comparable to the interest in vol¬ 
ume and depth exhibited by Late Gothic sculptors and painters. 


THE SPREAD OF GOTHIC ART 

The refined royal French style of the Paris region was enthusias¬ 
tically received abroad, where it was adapted to a variety of local 
conditions. In fact, the Gothic monuments of England and 
Germany have become objects of such intense national pride 
since the early nineteenth century that Gothic has been claimed as 
a native style in both countries. A number of factors contributed 
to the rapid spread of Gothic art. Among them were the skill of 
French architects and stone carvers and the prestige of French 
centers of learning, such as the cathedral School of Chartres and 
the University of Paris. Still, one wonders whether any of these 
explanations really go to the heart of the matter. The basic reason 
for the spread of Gothic art was undoubtedly the persuasive 
power of the style itself. It kindled the imagination and aroused 
religious feeling even among people far removed from the cultural 
climate of the Ile-de-France. 

Spain 

During the Romanesque period, Spanish artists had adopted the 
French manner of building and decoration in part to disassociate 
themselves from—and indeed to express their supremacy over— 
the Muslims with whom they shared the Iberian peninsula. This 


CHAPTER 1 2 GOTHIC ART 423 























identification of French style with Christian conquest encouraged 
the reception of the Gothic style in Spain during the thirteenth 
century, when numerous Christian victories (principal among 
them the battle at Navas de Tolosa in 1212) drove the Muslims 
farther and farther south. 

LEON The cathedral of Santa Marfa in Leon (figs. 12.45 and 
12.46), a city with a long history as a royal capital, recalls French 
High Gothic buildings associated with the monarchy, especially 
Reims cathedral, the French coronation church. The east end of 
Leon, with its ambulatory and five radiating chapels, is particu¬ 
larly similar to the arrangement at Reims (see fig. 12.26), so much 
so that, although the specific identification of Leon’s architect has 
been questioned, there has never been any doubt that he was 
French, nor that he knew the cathedral at Reims intimately. This 
reliance on a French model indicates a time lag, since Leon was 
not begun until the 1240s, some 30 years after Reims. Leon’s ele¬ 
vation (fig. 12.47) is more up-to-date, and its tall, thin clerestory 
lancets recall the Sainte-Chapelle (see fig. 12.32), completed in the 
same decade in which Leon was begun. 

The association of Leon with French royal buildings is signif¬ 
icant at this time. In 1230, Ferdinand III united the kingdoms of 


radiating

Leon and Castile. Despite this, royal attentions continued to 
favor Burgos, capital of Castile, which had earlier been declared 
“mother and head” of all churches in the kingdom and where a 
Gothic cathedral in the French style was begun in 1221. The 
Leonese promoted their citys historic rank as royal capital, more 
venerable than Burgos, through the building program of their 
new cathedral. 

Although many of the jamb figures of the cathedral of Santa 
Marfa at Leon have been rearranged from their original locations, 
the sculptors’ reliance on the French High Gothic manner of 
carving is clear. The figure of Simeon, the New Testament seer 
who recognized the infant Jesus as Redeemer (fig. 12.48), carved 
in the last decades of the thirteenth century and placed on the 
right portal of the west facade, recalls sculptures from Reims (see 
figs. 12.28 and 12.29) in the elegant elongation of the body, the 
complicated and crisp folds of drapery, and the thick, wavy beard. 

Leon is only one of a number of Spanish Gothic cathedrals 
that look to France for their inspiration. Toledo and Burgos, both 
cities with claims to royal status, also created buildings to designs 
that relied on French models and employed architects who

undoubtedly came from France. Thus, the royal origins of the 
Gothic style were clearly not forgotten, even when the style was 
exported from France more than 100 years after its original 
appearance there. 


England 

England was especially receptive to the new style, which devel¬ 
oped there as the influence of Gothic forms from the Ile-de- 
France melded with Anglo-Norman Romanesque features. A 
French architect who rebuilt the choir of Canterbury cathedral 
introduced the French Gothic manner to England in 1175. Within 
less than 50 years, English Gothic developed a well-defined 
character of its own, known as the Early English style, which 


dominated the second quarter of the thirteenth century. Although 
there was a great deal of building during those decades, it con¬ 
sisted mostly of additions to existing Anglo-Norman structures. 
Many English cathedrals begun during the Romanesque period 
had remained unfinished; they were now completed or enlarged. 
As a result, we find few churches that are designed entirely in the 
Early English style. 

SALISBURY CATHEDRAL The exception to the trend of 
multiple periods and styles in a single English Gothic church is 
Salisbury cathedral, begun in 1220, the same year as Amiens 
cathedral. One sees immediately how different the exterior of 
Salisbury (fig. 12.49) is from French Gothic churches (see figs. 
12.10, 12.20, and 12.27) and how futile it would be to judge it by 
the same standards. Compactness and verticality have given way 
to a long, low, sprawling look. (The crossing tower, which 
provides a dramatic unifying accent, was built a century later than 
the rest and is much taller than originally planned.) Since height is 
not the main goal, flying buttresses are used only as an after¬ 
thought, not as integral design elements. The west facade is 
treated like a screen wall, wider than the church itself and divided 
into horizontal bands of ornament and statuary. The towers have 
shrunk to stubby turrets (small towers). The plan (fig. 12.50), with 
its double transept, retains the segmented quality of the 
Romanesque, while the square east end derives from Cistercian 
architecture (see fig. 11.21). 

As we enter the nave (fig. 12.51), we recognize many elements 
familiar to us from French interiors of the time, such as Chartres 
cathedral (see fig. 12.12). However, the English interpretation 
produces a very different effect. As on the facade, horizontal divi¬ 
sions dominate at the expense of the vertical. Hence, we experi¬ 
ence the nave wall not as a succession of vertical bays but as a 
series of arches and supports. These supports, carved of dark 
stone, stand out against the rest of the interior. This method of 
stressing their special function is one of the hallmarks of the 
Early English style. The use of bands of color also emphasizes 
horizontality. 

Another distinctive feature is the steep curve of the nave vault. 
The ribs rise all the way from the triforium level. As a result, the 
clerestory gives the impression of being tucked away among the 
vaults. At Durham cathedral, more than a century earlier, the 
same treatment had been a technical necessity (see figs. 11.43 and 
11.44). Now, it has become a matter of style, in keeping with the 
character of English Early Gothic as a whole. This character 
might be described as conservative in the positive sense: It accepts 
the French form but tones down its revolutionary aspects to 
maintain a strong sense of continuity with the Anglo-Norman 
past. In fact, French elements were integrated with a structure that 
was still based on thick walls with passages much like that found 
in Durham cathedral. The contrast between the bold upward 
thrust of the fourteenth-century crossing tower at Salisbury and 
the leisurely horizontal progression throughout the rest of this 
thirteenth-century cathedral suggests that English Gothic had 
developed in a new direction during the intervening 100 years.

GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL The change in the English 
Gothic becomes very clear if we compare the interior of Salisbury 
with the choir of Gloucester cathedral, built in the second quarter 
of the fourteenth century (fig. 12.52). Gloucester is an outstand¬ 
ing example of English Late Gothic, also called the Perpendicular 
Gothic style. The name certainly fits, since we now find a domi¬ 
nant vertical accent that was absent in the English Early Gothic 
style. Vertical continuity is most evident at Gloucester in the 
responds that run in an unbroken line from the floor to the vault. 
In this respect, Perpendicular Gothic is much closer to French 
sources, but it includes so many uniquely English features that it 
would look out of place on the Continent. The repetition of small 
uniform tracery panels recalls the bands of statuary on the west 
facade at Salisbury (see fig. 12.49). The square end repeats the 
apses of earlier English churches, and the upward curve of the 
vault is as steep as in the nave of Salisbury (see fig. 12.51). 

The ribs of the vaults, on the other hand, have taken on a new 
role. They have been multiplied until they form an ornamental 
network that screens the boundaries between the bays, with the 


result that the entire vault looks like one continuous surface. The 
ceiling reads as a canopy fluttering above the interior. This effect, 
in turn, emphasizes the unity of the interior space. Such elabora¬ 
tion of the classic four-part vault is characteristic of the 
Flamboyant style on the Continent as well (see pages 422-23), but 
the English started it earlier and carried it much further. 

WESTMINSTER HALL The Perpendicular Gothic vaults of 
Gloucester and the taste for ornate and decorative forms that they 
represent have a parallel in wooden construction in England. 
Wood is obviously more fragile than stone and, given the preva¬ 
lence of fires during the Middle Ages, few monumental wooden 
structures survive. The timber roof of Westminster Hall in 
London (fig. 12.53) is exceptional. The oak ceiling covers what 
was the great hall of the principal London residence of English 
monarchs during the Middle Ages; most of the palace was 
destroyed by fire in 1834 and on the site the Houses of 
Parliament, still officially referred to as the Palace of Westminster, 
was subsequently built.

12.53 Henry Yevele and Hugh Herland. Interior and wooden roof of 
Westminster Hall, London. 1390s 

Westminster Hall, originally constructed in 1097 in the 
Norman Romanesque style, contained a central space flanked by 
side aisles marked with wooden posts. When the current roof was 
added between 1395 and 1396 by the master mason Henry Yevele 
and the master carpenter Hugh Herland, the old posts were 
removed so that the vast space, more than 235 feet long, 67 feet 
wide, and 90 feet high, is roofed without floor supports, covering 
a space half as large again as any hall previously built in England. 
Major structural elements are found in the hammer beams, which 
stick out horizontally from the wall and are carved with flying 
angels, and the arches that are supported on stone brackets deco¬ 
rated with heraldic designs. As is true with vaulted Gothic build¬ 
ings (see fig. 12.13), each design constituent of the roof supports 
additional elements in a complex and intricate system based on 
interdependence, so that, for example, the hammer beams resist 
horizontal thrust while the arches channel vertical force to the 
masonry walls. The weight of the roof is indeed considerable, 
calculated at approximately 660 tons. The walls, belonging to the 
original Romanesque building, were reinforced on the exterior 
with flying buttresses at the time the timber ceiling was added. 
Admittedly, some of the elements, such as the profusion of 
Perpendicular tracery, serve more of a decorative than a structural 
function, but they too relate to the development in the fourteenth 
century of large, heavily decorated, stone-vaulted spaces free of 
interior supports (see fig. 12.52); as with those buildings, the inte¬ 
gration of engineering and aesthetics at Westminster Hall is a 
remarkable achievement. Secular and religious buildings thus 
express similar aesthetic aims. 


12.54 Chapel of Henry VII, Westminster Abbey, London. 1503-19 


CHAPEL OF HENRY VII The Perpendicular Gothic style 
reaches its climax in the amazing hanging vault of Henry VIIs 
Chapel at Westminster Abbey, built in the early years of the six¬ 
teenth century (fig. 12.54). With its lanternlike knobs hanging 
from conical Hans,” this chapel merges ribs and tracery patterns 
in a dazzling display of architectural pageantry. The complex 
vault patterns are unrelated to the structure of either the walls or 
the vaults themselves. Like the decorative features of Saint- 
Maclou in Rouen (see fig. 12.44), elaborate motifs obscure rather 
than clarify the architecture. 

QUEEN MARY PSALTER As with Gothic architecture in 
England, manuscript illumination also shows an ambiguous rela¬ 
tionship to French models. Some features are remarkably akin to 
those in French works, while others seem more concerned with 
continuing traditional English forms and manner of representation. 
The Queen Mary Psalter (fig. 12.55) contains about 1,000 separate 
images, including biblical scenes, illustrations of saints 5 lives, and 
hunting scenes. The folio illustrating Jesus Teaching in the Temple 
combines two types of painting, which appear throughout the 
manuscript. The main scene is a full-color illumination, with a

decorative gold background and an architectural framework, 
while the bas-de-page is a tinted drawing. Despite the differences 
in technique, both scenes (and all the others in the manuscript) 
were created by a single artist, a remarkable achievement, partic¬ 
ularly since this artist produced at least two other fully decorated 
books. Although scholars have suggested a general reliance on a 
French manner in the arrangement of the scenes, in the graceful, 
courtly sway of the figure, and in the inclusion of bas-de-page 
illustrations, the style of painting is more closely related to older 
English models. It is almost purely linear and there is very little 
evidence of shading. 


The bas-de-page represents an elegant equestrian couple out 
hawking. A female attendant on horseback and a boy servant on 
foot accompany them. The lively scene, taken from the daily life 
of the nobility, is filled with naturalistic details, from the falcon 
attacking a duck at the lower left, to the way the male rider 
engages his female companion, both of them pointing at the hunt 
scene in front of them. Their forward movement is propelled by 
the active, wavelike lines of the horses’ manes and the servants 
gestures. In the main scene, line also conveys meaning with sensi¬ 
tivity and precision. The soft lines of hair and cloth that frame the 
face of the Virgin Mary contrast strongly with the sharply curved 
lines of the hair and beards of the Jews gathered in the Temple to 
hear her son teach. 

The iconographic connection between the vignette in the 
bottom margin and the biblical scene is not clear. What is clear is 
that scenes from the courtly world are interwoven, or at least 
coexist, with biblical history, as they did in French manuscripts of 
the same period. In the English manuscript, however, the 
marginal illustrations are serial; they continue from one page to 
the next, just as the cycle of biblical events does. It is not known 
for whom this manuscript was made, although there is general 
agreement that it must have been produced between about 1310 
and 1320 and, given its splendor, must have been a royal commis¬ 
sion. The most convincing theory posits that King Edward II 
(r. 1307-1327) commissioned the book for his queen, Isabella of 
France. The name by which the manuscript is known today 
results from the fact that it was given to Queen Mary Tudor in the 
sixteenth century. 


Germany 

In Germany, Gothic architecture took root a good deal more 
slowly than in England. Until the mid-thirteenth century, the 
Romanesque tradition, with its persistent Ottoman elements, 
remained dominant, despite the growing acceptance of Early 
Gothic features. From about 1250 on, however, the High Gothic 
of the Ile-de-France had a strong impact on the Rhineland. 
Cologne cathedral (begun in 1248) is an ambitious attempt to 
carry the full-fledged French system beyond the stage of Amiens. 
However, it was not completed until modern times. Nor were any 
others like it ever built. While some German sculptors relied on 
French models, others pursued a more independent course, unlike 
German architects. German Gothic sculptures are sometimes 
dramatic, sometimes poignant, and sometimes lifelike, but they 
always express deep, if sometimes restrained, emotion. 

HEILIGENKREUZ IN SCHWABISH-GMUND Especially 
characteristic of German Gothic is the hall church, or 
Hallenkirche. This type of church, with aisles and nave of the 
same height, stems from Romanesque architecture (see fig. 11.23). 
Although also found in France, it was in Germany that its possi¬ 
bilities were explored fully Heiligenkreuz (Holy Cross) in 
Schwabish-Gmiind (fig. 12.56) is one of many examples from

in 1317, although it was perhaps his son Peter who was responsi¬ 
ble for the enlarged choir of 1351. (Heinrich had at least two other 
sons, two grandsons, and a great-grandson who were also archi¬ 
tects.) The space has a fluidity and expansiveness that enfolds us 
as if we were standing under a huge canopy, reminiscent of the 
effect at Gloucester cathedral (see fig. 12.52). There is no clear 
sense of direction to guide us. And the unbroken lines of the 
pillars, formed by bundles of shafts that diverge as they turn 
into lacy ribs covering the vaults, seem to echo the continuous 
movement that we feel in the space itself. 

NAUMBURG CATHEDRAL The growth of Gothic sculpture in 
Germany can be easily traced. From the 1220s on, German 
masters who had been trained in the sculpture workshops of the 
French cathedrals brought the new style back home. Because 
German architecture at that time was still mainly Romanesque, 
however, large statuary cycles like those at Chartres and Reims 


were not produced on facades, where they would have looked out 
of place. As a result, German Gothic sculpture tended to be less 
closely linked with its architectural setting. In fact, the finest work 
was often done for the interiors of churches. 

This independence permitted a greater expressive freedom 
than in France. It is strikingly evident in the work of the 
Naumburg Master, whose best-known work is the series of stat¬ 
ues and reliefs made around 1255 for Naumburg cathedral. The 
Crucifixion (fig. 12.57) forms the center of the choir screen; flank¬ 
ing it are statues of the Virgin and John the Evangelist. Enclosed 
by a deep, gabled porch, the three figures frame the opening that 
links the nave with the sanctuary. Rather than placing the group 
above the screen, as was usual, the sculptor brought the subject 
down to earth physically and emotionally The suffering of Jesus 
thus becomes a human reality through the emphasis on the weight 
and volume of his body Mary and John, pleading with the viewer, 
convey their grief more eloquently than ever before. 


432 PART II THE MIDDLE AGES

The Kiss of Judas , on the choir screen,

The pathos of these figures is heroic and dramatic compared 
with the quiet lyricism of the Reims Visitation (see fig. 12.28). If 
the classical High Gothic sculpture of France can be compared 
with the calm restraint of Pheidias (see fig. 5.43), the Naumburg 
Master embodies the temperamental counterpart of the strained 
physicality demonstrated in Hellenistic art (see fig. 5.71). 

The same intensity dominates the Passion scenes, such as The 
Kiss of Judas (fig. 12.58), with its strong contrast between the 
meekness of Jesus and the violence of the sword-wielding St. 
Peter. Attached to the responds inside the choir are life-size stat¬ 
ues of 12 nobles associated with the founding of the eleventh- 
century cathedral. The sculptures were made at a time when 
Bishop Dietrich II of Naumburg was attempting to raise funds to 
build a new choir for the cathedral. By highlighting the original 
building s generous benefactors, the bishop encouraged parish¬ 
ioners to support the new building campaign, to join the ranks of 
the cathedral s munificent sponsors. These men and women were 
not of the artist s own time—to him they were only names in a 
chronicle. Yet the pair Ekkehard and Uta (fig. 12.59) are as indi¬ 
vidual and realistic as if they had been portrayed from life. The 
gestures of their hands, the handling of their drapery, and their 
fixed gazes communicate human qualities with great subtlety. 
Their individuality and specificity remind us that the concern for 
the personal identity of individuals signaled important social

changes during the Gothic period. The trend toward realism is 
not unique here and is reminiscent of what occurred at Reims 
cathedral (see figs. 12.28 and 12.29). The inclusion of historical 
figures within a sacred space is unusual, and it is perhaps the fact 
that the persons represented were long dead that made them 
appropriate for representation here. 

The paint that is still visible on Naumburg s interior sculpture 
helps us appreciate how Gothic sculpture might have looked 
originally. Gothic interiors, as can be seen in the restored Sainte- 
Chapelle, were elaborately painted. Exterior sculpture was also 
painted, but that paint rarely survives today 

ROETTCEN PIETA Gothic sculpture, as we have come to 
know it so far, reflects a desire to give a greater emotional appeal 
to traditional themes of Christian art. Toward the end of the thir¬ 
teenth century, this tendency gave rise to a new kind of religious 
image. (See www.myartslab.com. ) Originally designed for private 
devotion, it is often referred to by the German term 
Andachtsbild (contemplation image), since Germany played the 
leading part in its development. The most widespread type was a 
representation of the Virgin grieving over the dead Christ. It is 
called a Pieta after an Italian word derived from the Latin pietas , 
the root word for both “pity” and “piety.” No such scene occurs 
in the scriptural accounts of the Passion. We do not know where 
or when the Pieta was invented, but it portrays one of the Seven 
Sorrows of the Virgin. It thus forms a tragic counterpart to the 
motif of the Madonna and Child, one of her Seven Joys. 

The Roettgen Pieta (fig. 12.60) is carved of wood and vividly 
painted. Like most such groups, this large cult statue was meant 
to be placed on an altar. The style, like the subject, expresses the 
emotional fervor of lay religiosity, which emphasized a personal 
relationship with God as part of the tide of mysticism that swept 
over fourteenth-century Europe. Realism here is purely a means 
to enhance the work s impact. The faces convey unbearable pain 
and grief; the wounds are exaggerated grotesquely; and the bodies 
and limbs are puppetlike in their thinness and rigidity The 
purpose of the work is clearly to arouse so overwhelming a sense 
of horror and pity that the faithful will share in Christ s suffering 
and identify with the grief-stricken Mother of God. The ultimate 
goal of this emotional bond is a spiritual transformation that 
grasps the central mystery of God in human form through 
compassion (meaning “to suffer with”). 

At first glance, the Roettgen Pieta would seem to have little in 
common with the Virgin of Paris (see fig. 12.42), which dates from 
the same period. Yet they share a lean, “deflated” quality of form 
and exert a strong emotional appeal to a viewer. Both features 
characterize the art of northern Europe from the late thirteenth to 
the mid-fourteenth century Only after 1350 do we again find an 
interest in weight and volume, coupled with a renewed desire to 
explore tangible reality as part of a change in religious outlook. 


The growing concern for the individual that is expressed in 
much of the Gothic art we have studied so far develops most fully 
in Italy and becomes the central focus of Gothic experiments 
there. Indeed, the Gothic achievements in Italy are of such conse¬ 
quence in their own right and for the later development of 
Western art that they have been assigned their own chapter in this 
book, which follows.

Art in Thirteenth- and 
Fourteenth-Century Italy 


LU 


T he map of the Italian peninsula (map is.i) hints at the 

forces that shaped life and art there in the thirteenth and fourteenth 
centuries. Although the Alps separate the peninsula from the rest of 
Europe, branches of the Mediterranean Sea surround it, providing 
access by water to the rest of the world. As the heart of the Roman Empire, the 


peninsula abounded in the physical remains of Rome. Italy was 
also the center of the Catholic Church for much of the Middle 
Ages, bringing church officials and ambassadors from Europe to 
its cities. The culture formed by this geography was distinctive 
and cosmopolitan. 

The length of the coastline encouraged trade by sea, while 
Italy’s location made it a natural link between Europe and Africa 
and Asia. Coastal cities, such as Pisa, Genoa and Venice, con¬ 
trolled these important trade routes. Italian vessels carried goods 
from as far away as Constantinople and the Baltics to its cities. 
Merchants traveled over land, too, even reaching the court of the 
Great Khan in China. 

This geography had profound effects on Italian society. In the 
absence of a strong central authority, the cities controlled the 
regions around them, so that there was no single political unit 
called Italy. Unlike many other parts of Europe, political power 
lay not in the hands of the hereditary aristocracy, but in the hands 
of urban elites. Monarchs controlled only a few regions: 
Lombardy in the north and Naples in the south. Instead, the 
wealthiest and most influential cities, including Florence and 
Siena, were organized as representative republics, with political 
offices held by mercantile oligarchs. As a check on inherited

Chapel, Padua. 


power, some cities even excluded the landed aristocracy from 
participating in their political processes. 

The larger powers of Europe, especially the two international 
institutions of the Holy Roman Empire and the papacy, often 
interfered in Italian politics, though sometimes from a distance. 
The emperors usually remained north of the Alps, though they 
claimed to control portions of Italy. The papacy left Italy for 
southern France in the fourteenth century, underscoring the 
power and influence of the French king. The prestige of the 
French monarchy enhanced the appeal of the Gothic style of 
building born near Paris and its related pictorial innovations, 
which artists in Italy adapted to their traditions. 

The context in which Italian artists developed their skills dif¬ 
fered from the rest of Europe. Throughout the Middle Ages, Roman 
and Early Christian art served as an inspiration for Italian archi¬ 
tects and sculptors, as is visible in such works as the cathedral of 
Pisa (see fig. 11.33). In the mid-thirteenth century, the Holy Roman 
emperor Frederick II (1194-1250), who lived for a time in south¬ 
ern Italy, deliberately revived imperial Roman style to express his 
own political ambitions as heir to the Roman Empire. The other 
empire, Byzantium, kept a presence throughout Italy, too— 
through mosaics at Ravenna, Sicily, and Venice, and through the 
circulation of artists and icons such as the Madonna Enthroned 
(see fig. 8.49). A further element added to the vocabulary of 
Italian artists was the French Gothic style, created in the Paris 
region and introduced through the travels of artists and patrons. 


CHAPTER 1 3 ART IN THIRTEENTH- AND FOURTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 


437 


CHAPTER 





One of those travelers, the poet churchman, and scholar 
Francesco Petrarch, exemplifies another aspect of fourteenth- 
century Italian culture: a growing interest in the creative works of 
individuals. Petrarch and his contemporaries Dante Alighieri and 
Giovanni Boccaccio belong to a generation of thinkers and writ¬ 
ers who turned to the study of ancient works of literature, history, 
and art to seek out beautiful and correct forms. Petrarch also 
sought to improve the quality of written Latin, and thereby to 
emulate the works of the Roman authors Vergil and Cicero. This 
study of ancient thought and art led to a search for moral clarity 
and models of behavior, a mode of inquiry that came to be known 
as humanism. Humanists valued the works of the ancients, both 
in the literary and the visual arts, and they looked to the classical 
past for solutions to modern problems. They particularly admired 
Roman writers who championed civic and personal virtues, such 
as service to the state and stoicism in times of trouble. Humanists 
considered Roman forms the most authoritative and, therefore, 
the most worthy of imitation, though Greek texts and ideas were 
also admired. 

The study of the art of Rome and Greece would profoundly 
change the culture and the art of Europe by encouraging artists to 
look at nature carefully and to consider the human experience as 
a valid subject for art. These trends found encouragement in the 
ideals and theology of late medieval groups, such as the 
Dominicans, who valued classical learning, and the Franciscans, 
whose founder saw God in the beauty of nature. These bodies, 
called mendicants because they originally supported themselves 
from alms, became an important stimulus to thirteenth- and 
fourteenth-century patronage. 


THE GROWTH OF 

THE MENDICANT ORDERS 

AND THE VISUAL ARTS IN ITALY 

The two major mendicant groups were the Franciscans and the 
Dominicans. They established international “orders,” as many 
monastic groups had done in the Middle Ages, although their 
missions differed from those of traditional monks. Both orders 
were founded to minister to the lay populations in the rapidly 
expanding cities; they did not retreat from the world, but engaged 
with it. Each order of friars (brothers) built churches in the cities 
so that sermons could be preached to crowds of people. The 
Dominicans, founded by Dominic de Guzman in 1216, were 
especially concerned with combating heresy. The Franciscan 
order, founded by Francis of Assisi in 1209, worked in the cities 
to bring deeper spirituality and comfort to the poor. Taking vows 
of poverty, Franciscans were committed to teaching the laity and 
to encouraging them to pursue spiritual growth. Toward this goal, 
they told stories and used images to explain and affirm the teach¬ 
ings of the Church. Characteristically, Franciscans urged the 
faithful to visualize events such as the Nativity in tangible ways, 
including setting up Nativity scenes (creches) in churches as an 
aid to devotion. Both orders played important roles in late 
medieval religious and artistic life, though the Franciscans held a 
special place in Italy since their founder was a native son. 

The Franciscans at Assisi and Florence 

The charismatic Francis died in 1226 and was named a saint two 
years later. His home town and burial place was the site of a huge 


438 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 
















13.1 Interior of Upper Church, Basilica of San Francesco, Assisi. Begun 1228; consecrated 1253 


church built in his honor. The pope sponsored its construction, 
which began shortly after Francis’s canonization in 1228; the 
church was consecrated in 1253. Because it held the body of the 
popular saint, it was built as a large, multistoried structure in 
order to accommodate the numerous pilgrims it attracted. Most 
pilgrims would first encounter the large hall of the Upper 
Church, before descending to a church below. The Upper Church 
(fig. 13.1) consists of a single long nave, or central hall, where 
crowds could gather. Whereas French churches of the same 
period reduced wall surfaces in their naves in favor of large 
stained-glass windows and complex vertical supports, as is the 
case at Chartres (see fig. 12.12), San Francesco at Assisi has rela¬ 
tively small windows and large expanses of wall surface. As in the 
northern churches, at San Francesco a brick vault, supported by 
Gothic pointed arches, covers the nave. Yet San Francesco is nei¬ 
ther as high nor as spatially complex as French Gothic churches. 
The elimination of lower side aisles along the length of the nave 
simplifies the space and makes the walls more prominent. These 
wall surfaces became a magnet for artists, especially below the 
windows in the nave of the Upper Church. Their paintings 
were executed in the fresco technique, which Italian artists had 


used throughout the Middle Ages. (See Materials and Techniques , 
page 441.) 

The scale of the painting program at Assisi required teams of 
artists drawn from all over Italy and the work took many years to 
complete. From the 1270s through the early fourteenth century, 
papal sponsorship brought together artists from Rome, Siena, 
Florence, and elsewhere. Assisi became a laboratory for the devel¬ 
opment and dissemination of fourteenth-century Italian art. The 
frescoes flanking the nave windows depict biblical scenes from 
the book of Genesis and the life of Christ. But the most visible 
frescoes in the nave were painted below the windows; these depict 
the life and achievements of Francis himself. 

The artists responsible for the St. Francis cycle had to devise 
images that conveyed both the events of Francis’s life and their 
significance to Christian history. The events chosen for depiction 
came from biographies of Francis’s life composed by his follow¬ 
ers. One important theme found in these texts is the saint’s vener¬ 
ation of nature as a manifestation of divine workmanship. The 
scene St. Francis Preaching to the Birds (fig. 13.2) expresses this 
theme and Francis’s attitude that all creatures are connected. The 
fresco depicts Francis in his brown habit standing in a landscape

and speaking to a flock of birds. To the astonished eyes of his 
companion, Francis appears to be able to communicate with the 
birds, who gather at his feet to listen. 

The artist sets the scene outdoors by framing the figures with 
trees and painting the background blue. A narrow shelf of earth 
creates a platform on which the bulky figures stand. Francis and 
his companion are rendered naturalistically, as the artist describes 
light washing over their forms to suggest their mass and weight. 
Francis’s figure becomes the focal point of the image, through his 
central position, the halo around his head, and his downward 
glance. His body language—the bent-over stance, the movement 
of his hands—express his intense engagement with the birds as 
representatives of nature. The simplicity of the composition 
makes the fresco easily legible and memorable. 

The identities of the artists responsible for the frescoes in the 
nave of San Francesco are uncertain and controversial. One of the 
artists mentioned as a primary designer and painter is the Roman 
Pietro Cavallini; another is the Florentine Giotto di Bondone. But 


documentary evidence is lacking, and the opinions of connois¬ 
seurs vary. Some prefer to assign these frescoes to an anonymous 
master, or masters, named either after the paintings at Assisi or 
subgroups among them. Since many painters worked in the same 
space, they competed with and influenced each other, thus affect¬ 
ing the future direction of Italian art. 

Franciscan women served God within the walls of their con¬ 
vents, through their vocations as nuns, and their prayers for their 
neighbors. Like the friars, these women devoted themselves to 
poverty and simplicity, and their convents and churches were often 
less wealthy than many of the masculine institutions. Franciscan 
nuns belonged to the branch of the order founded by Francis’s 
associate, St. Clare, who was canonized in 1255. The thirteenth-

Fresco Painting and Conservation 


F resco is a technique for applying paint to walls that results in an 
image that is both durable and brilliant. Frescoed surfaces are built 
up in layers: Over the rough wall goes a layer of rough lime-based 
plaster called arriccio. The artist then draws preliminary sketches onto 
this layer of plaster. Because they are done in red, these sketches are 
called sinopie (an Italian word derived from ancient Sinope, in Asia 
Minor, which was famous as a source of red-colored pigment). Then a 
finer plaster called intonaco is applied in areas just large enough to 
provide for a day’s worth of painting—the gi or nut a (from giorno, the 
Italian word for “day”). While the plaster is still wet, the artist applies 
pigments suspended in lime water. As the plaster dries, the pigments 
bind to it, creating a buon fresco, or “true fresco.” Plaster dries in a 
day, which is why only the amount of wet plaster that can be painted 
during that time can be applied. The work has to be done on a scaf¬ 
fold, so it is carried out from top to bottom, usually in horizontal strips 
about 4 to 6 feet long. As each horizontal level is completed, the scaf¬ 
folding is lowered for the next level. To prevent chemical interactions 
with the lime of the plaster, some colors have to be applied a secco or 
dry; many details of images are applied this way as well. Fresco secco 
does not bond to the plaster as surely as buon fresco does, so it tends 
to flake off over time. Consequently, some frescoes have subsequently 
been touched up with tempera paints. 

Although durability is the key reason for painting in fresco, over the 
centuries wars and floods have caused damage. Modern conservators 
have developed techniques for removing frescoes from walls and 
installing them elsewhere. After the Arno River flooded in 1 966, many 
Florentine frescoes were rescued in this way, not only preserving the 
artworks but greatly adding to the knowledge and technology required 
for this task. When a fresco is removed, series of cuts are made around 
the image. Then, a supporting canvaslike material is applied to the 
frescoed surface with a water-soluble glue. The surface to which the 
canvaslike material has been glued can then be pulled off gently and 
transferred to a new support to be hung elsewhere, after which the 
canvas can be removed. Such removals have exposed many sinopie, 
such as the one shown here. The fresco, attributed to Francesco Traini 


(see fig. 1 3.30), was badly damaged by fire in 1 944 and had to be 
detached from the wall in order to save what was left of it. This proce¬ 
dure revealed the plaster underneath, on which the composition had 
been sketched out. These drawings, of the same size as the fresco 
itself, are much freer-looking in style than the actual fresco. They often 
reveal the artist’s personal style more directly than the painted 
version, which was carried out with the aid of assistants.

of Death (detail). Camposanto, Pisa 


century convent in Assisi dedicated to St. Clare does not boast a 
large fresco cycle but preserves a painted panel (fig. 13.3) intended 
to sit on an altar (an altarpiece). A tall rectangle of wood covered 
with egg-based tempera paints, it was executed around 1280. It is 
dominated by the figure of St. Clare, dressed in the habit of her 
order, standing frontally and holding the staff of an abbess. The 
image does not portray her specific features as a portrait would, 
but represents her as a saintly figure of authority, whose large 
staring eyes and frontal posture have roots in Byzantine art. 
Alongside the saint eight tiny narratives convey stories about her 
life, death, and miracles. These vignettes relate her commitment 
to her vocation, her obedience to Francis and the Church, and her 
service to her fellow nuns. The narratives make little pretense at 
three-dimensional form or spatial structure, keeping the focus on 
the figures and their actions the better to tell the story. 


Churches and Their Furnishings 
in Urhan Centers 

Franciscan churches began to appear all over Italy as the friars 
ministered to the spiritual lives of city dwellers. A characteristic 
example in Florence is the church of Santa Croce (Holy Cross), 
begun around 1295 (figs. 13.4 and 13.5). The architect was proba¬ 
bly the Tuscan sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio. Like San Francesco 
in Assisi, Santa Croce shares some features with Gothic churches 
in northern Europe, but it differs from them too. Its form is a 
basilica (a standard church plan including nave, side aisles, and 
apse), though the eastern end, where the high altar and many 
chapels are located, terminates in mostly rectilinear forms. Only 
the apse (or projecting niche), where the altar stands, is poly¬ 
gonal. This simplified design for the most sacred spaces in the

church probably comes from monastic churches, especially of the 
reform-minded Cistercian order; for example, the plan of 
Fontenay Abbey (see fig. 11.21). The nave’s proportions are broad 
and expansive rather than vertical. The nave arcade uses a Gothic 
pointed arch, while vertical moldings pull the eye up to the ceil¬ 
ing. Where in a French Gothic church, however, such moldings 
would support a vaulted ceiling, at Santa Croce wooden trusses 
(beams or rafters joined together) span the nave. The only vaults 
are at the apse and several chapels at the ends of the transept, the 
perpendicular space between the nave and the apse. 

As the stone vaults of San Francesco in Assisi, the order’s 
mother church, indicate that the friars were not averse to such 
structures, the choice of a wooden roof at Santa Croce may 
need explanation. This preference perhaps originates in a Tuscan 
tradition, as the great Romanesque cathedral of nearby Pisa (fig. 
11.34) also has a wooden roof. Santa Croces broad nave with 
high arches is also reminiscent of Early Christian churches (see 
fig. 8.9), so the choice may also spring from a desire to evoke the 


simplicity of Early Christian basilicas and thus link Franciscan 
poverty with the traditions of the early Church. A vaulted nave 
would have been much more expensive. 

Santa Croce served the growing population of Florence by 
providing room for elite burials in its aisles and chapels. The 
church’s wide spaces also held large crowds so they could hear the 
friars’ sermons. 

Pulpits in Pisan Churches 

For reading Scripture at services and for preaching, churchmen 
often commissioned monumental pulpits with narrative or sym¬ 
bolic images carved onto them. Several monumental pulpits were 
made by members of a family of sculptors who worked in Pisa, 
including Nicola Pisano (ca. 1220/25-1284) and his son Giovanni 
Pisano (1265-1314). Though the two men worked at various sites 
throughout Italy, they executed important pulpits for the cathe¬ 
dral and baptistery at Pisa.

Baptistery, Pisa 


For the Pisan baptistery, Nicola Pisano and his workshop 
carved a hexagonal marble pulpit finished around 1260 (fig. 13.6). 
Rising to about 15 feet high, so the assembly could see and hear 
the speaker, the six sides of the pulpit rest on colored marble 
columns supporting classically inspired capitals. Above the capi¬ 
tals, carved into leaf shapes, small figures symbolizing the virtues 
stand between cusped arches, while figures of the prophets sit in 
the spandrels (the areas above the curves) of these arches. 
Surprisingly, one of these figures (fig. 13.7) is a male nude with a 
lion cub on his shoulder and a lion skin over his arm. His form 
and the lion skin should identify him as the Greek hero Herakles 
(Hercules in Latin). Some scholars, however, have interpreted 
these same details to identify him as Daniel, the biblical hero whose 
faith allowed him to survive the lion s den. In either case, in the 
program of the pulpit, he stands for the Christian virtue of Forti¬ 
tude. His anatomy, his proportions, and his stance are probably 
the product of Nicola Pisano s study of Roman and Early Christian 
sculpture. The figure s heroic nudity and his posture, with the 


weight balanced on one leg to suggest movement, seem to be 
inspired by ancient models. Pisano had worked for Frederick II in 
southern Italy and at Rome, but his deep knowledge of ancient art 
may also derive from study of Roman artifacts in Pisa. 

Nicola s study of the Roman past informs many other ele¬ 
ments in his pulpit, including the narratives he carved for the six 
rectangular sides of the pulpit itself. These scenes from the life of 
Christ are carved in relief, so they project from the background. 
The Nativity scene in figure 13.8 is a densely crowded composi¬ 
tion that combines the Annunciation with the Birth of Christ. 
The relief is treated as a shallow box filled with solid convex 
shapes in the manner of Roman sarcophagi (carved stone coffins), 
which Pisas monumental cemetery preserved in good numbers. 
The Virgin has the dignity and bearing of a Roman matron. 
Pisano also knew Byzantine images of the Nativity, for the 
recumbent figure of the Virgin reflects that tradition. As the 
largest and most central figure, the reclining Virgin overpowers all 
the other elements in the composition. Around her, the details of

the narrative or setting, such as the midwives washing the child 
and Joseph s wondering gaze at the events, give the relief a human 
touch. Using forms inspired by both Byzantine and Roman 
models, Nicola uses broad figures, wrapped in classicizing 
draperies, to endow the scene with gravity and moral weight. 

When his son Giovanni Pisano carved a pulpit about 50 years 
later for the cathedral of Pisa, he chose a different emphasis. 
Though executed at the same size and using the same material, his 
relief of the Nativity from the cathedral pulpit (fig. 13.9) makes a 
strong contrast to his father s earlier work. Depicting the Nativity 
and the Annunciation to the shepherds, Giovanni dwells on the 
landscape and animal elements: Sheep and trees fill the right edge 
of the composition, while the Nativity itself takes place in a 
shallow cave in the Byzantine tradition. The Virgin still dominates 
the composition, but she is no longer a dignified matron staring 
out of the image. Instead, she is a young mother whose gaze and 
tender attention focus on her newborn child. Her proportions are 
elongated rather than sturdy. Rather than echoing Roman or 
Classical models, Giovanni has clearly studied contemporary 
French works to bring elegance and a detailed observation of 
nature to the image. Giovannis swaying figures move more 
comfortably in the space they occupy. Where Nicola s Nativity is 
dominated by convex, bulging masses, Giovanni s appears to be 
made up of cavities and shadows. The play of lights and darks in 
Giovanni s relief exhibits a dynamic quality that contrasts with 
the serene calm of his father s work.

Expanding Florence Cathedral 

The building and adornment of Pisas cathedral complex were a 
civic as well as a religious duty for the towns citizens. As Italian 
cities grew and prospered, their religious centers grew with them. 
East of Pisa, along the Arno River, the increasing wealth of 
Florence inspired that town to undertake major projects for its 
cathedral and baptistery in order to compete with its neighbors. 
One of Nicola Pisanos students, Arnolfo di Cambio (ca. 
1245-1302), was chosen to design a new cathedral for Florence to 
replace a smaller church that stood on the site. The cathedral was 
begun in 1296 (figs. 13.10,13.11, and 13.12). The project took the 


skills and energy of several generations, and the plan was modi¬ 
fied more than once. For example, in 1357 Francesco Talenti 
(active 1325-1369) took over the project and dramatically 
extended the building to the east. By 1367, a committee of artists 
consulted by the overseers of the construction decided to cover 
the eastern zone with a high dome. The west facade and other 
portals continued to be adorned with sculpture throughout the 
Renaissance period, but the marble cladding on the building was 
not completed until the nineteenth century. Florence s Duomo 
(dome) was intended to be a grand structure that would not only 
serve as the spiritual center of the city, but as a statement of its 
wealth and importance.

13.12 Plan of Florence cathedral and campanile 

Arnolfo s original design provided for a large basilica with a 
high arcade and broad proportions that differs sharply from con¬ 
temporary Gothic structures in France, even as it employs some 
of the technology of French Gothic. High pointed arches in the 
nave arcade rest on piers (vertical supports) articulated with leaf¬ 
shaped capitals. Flat moldings rise to the clerestory level, above 
the arcade. Windows in the clerestory and aisles are relatively 
small, leaving much more wall surface than in French cathedrals. 
Although the original plan called for a trussed wooden roof like 
the one at Santa Croce, by the mid-fourteenth century the plan 
had been altered to include ribbed groin vaults (stone vaults 
comprised of four sections with reinforcing along their edges), a 
detail closer to the northern Gothic taste. The later plans enlarged 
the eastern zone to terminate in three faceted arms which meet to 
form an octagonal space (the crossing) that would be covered by 
a dome. (This design appears in the fresco in fig. 13.31.) While this 


project included flying buttresses like French Gothic churches, 
these were never built. The scale of the proposed dome presented 
engineering difficulties that were not solved until the early fif¬ 
teenth century. Instead of tall western towers incorporated into 
the facade, which was the norm in Gothic France, the cathedral 
has a campanile (bell tower) as a separate structure in the Italian 
tradition. The campanile is the work of the Florentine painter 
Giotto and his successors. If Florence s cathedral has Gothic ele¬ 
ments in its vaults and arches, these foreign forms are tempered 
by local traditions. 

Opposite the cathedrals west front stands the venerable 
baptistery of Florence, built in the eleventh century on much 
older foundations, which the Florentines believed to be Roman; 
they saw the glory of their own past in the structure s age. St. John 
the Baptist is a patron saint of the city of Florence; newborns 
became citizens of Florence by being baptized in this structure. 
The baptistery was the site of important artistic projects through¬ 
out the Renaissance. In 1330, its overseers commissioned another 
sculptor from Pisa, Andrea Pisano (ca. 1295-1348; no relation to 
Nicola or Giovanni) to cast a new pair of bronze doors for the 
baptistery. These were finished and installed in 1336 (fig. 13.13). 
Cast of bronze and gilded, the project required 28 separate panels 
across the two panels of the door. They mostly represent scenes 
from the life of John the Baptist. Each vignette is framed by a 
Gothic quatrefoil, such as those found on the exteriors of French 
cathedrals. Yet within most of the four-lobed frames, Andrea pro¬ 
vides a projecting ledge to support the figures and the landscape 
or architectural backgrounds. The relief showing the Baptism of 
Christ demonstrates Andreas clear compositional technique:

Christ stands at the center, framed by John on the right in the act 
of baptism and an angelic witness on the left (fig. 13.14). The dove 
symbolizing the Holy Spirit appears above Christ s head. The 
emphasis is on the key figures, with little detail to distract from 
the main narrative; only a few small elements suggest the land¬ 
scape context of the Jordan River. If the beautiful torso of Christ 
in the river recalls the Fortitude figure from Nicola Pisano s Pisa 
Baptistery, the simplicity of the landscape and composition recall 
the frescoes at Assisi. 

Building for the City Government: 

The Palazzo della Signoria 

While the citizens of Florence were building the huge cathedral, 
the political faction that supported the papacy instead of the Holy 
Roman Empire consolidated its power in the city. The pro-papal 
party (the Guelphs) was largely composed of wealthier merchants 
who sought to contain the dynastic ambitions of aristocratic fam¬ 
ilies who supported the emperor (the Ghibellines). The pro-papal 
group commissioned a large structure to house their governing 
council and to serve as the symbol of the political independence 
of the city They probably chose Arnolfo di Cambio to design the 
Palazzo della Signoria (fig. 13.15). It was begun in 1298 and com¬ 
pleted in 1310, though it has been subject to later expansion and 
remodeling. It became known as the Palazzo Vecchio (or old 
palace) during the sixteenth century, when the ruling Medici 
family moved to another palace. 


Similar to fortified castles in the region, the Palazzo boasts 
thick stone walls, heavy battlements (defensive parapets), and a 
tall tower. Few windows pierce the walls of the lowest level, 
whose stones are left rough and uneven (or rusticated) to create 
the appearance of greater strength. The two upper stories display 
smoother masonry and more elegant pointed windows. The 
tower serves not only as a symbol of civic pride, but as a defen¬ 
sive structure. It sits slightly off-center for two reasons: This part 
of the building rests on the foundations of an earlier tower, and its 
position makes it visible from a main street in the city Boasting 
the highest civic tower in the city, the Palazzo della Signoria dom¬ 
inated the skyline of Florence and expressed the power of the 
communal good over powerful individual families.

PAINTING IN TUSCANY 

As with other art forms in the thirteenth century, Italian paint¬ 
ing s stylistic beginnings are different from those of the rest of 
Europe, although they shared traits and ideas. Italy’s ties to the 
Roman past and the Byzantine present would inspire Italian 
painters to render forms in naturalistic and monumental images. 
Throughout the Middle Ages, Byzantine mosaics and murals 
were visible to Italian artists. Venice had long-standing trading 
ties with the Byzantine Empire, while the crusades of the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries had brought Italy in even closer contact 
with Byzantium, including the diversion of the Fourth Crusade in 
1204 to Constantinople itself. 

One result of the short-lived occupation of Constantinople by 
western Europeans, from 1204 to 1261, was an infusion of 
Byzantine art forms and artists into Italy, which had a momentous 
effect on the development of Italian art in the thirteenth century. 
Later observers of the rapid changes that occurred in Italian paint¬ 
ing from 1200 to 1550 described the starting point of these 
changes as the “Greek manner,” by which they meant Byzantine 
art. Writing in the sixteenth century, the biographer and artist 
Giorgio Vasari reported that in the mid-thirteenth century, “Some 
Greek painters were summoned to Florence by the government 
of the city for no other purpose than the revival of painting in 
their midst, since that art was not so much debased as altogether 
lost.” Vasari assumes that medieval Italian painting was all but 
nonexistent and attributes to Byzantine art great influence over 
the development of Italian art in the thirteenth century. Italian 
artists were able to absorb the Byzantine tradition far more 
thoroughly at this time than ever before. When Gothic style from 
northern Europe began to influence artists working in this 
Byzantinizing tradition, a revolutionary synthesis of the two was 
accomplished by a generation of innovative and productive 
painters in Tuscan cities. 

Cimabue and Giotto 

One such artist was Cimabue of Florence (ca. 1250-after 1300), 
whom Vasari claimed had been apprenticed to a Greek painter. 
His presence has also been noted in Assisi, Rome, and Pisa. In 
the 1280s, he painted a large panel depicting the Madonna 
Enthroned (fig. 13.16), or Madonna in Majesty (Maesta), to sit on 
an altar in the church of Santa Trinita in Florence; the large scale 
of the altarpiece—it is more than 12 feet high—made it the 
devotional focus of the church. Its composition recalls Byzantine 
icons, such asthe Madonna Enthroned (see fig. 8.49), but its scale 
and verticality are closer to the Altarpiece of St. Clare (fig. 13.3) 
and similar thirteenth-century altarpieces than to Byzantine 
prototypes. Mary and her son occupy a heavy golden throne, 
flanked by rows of angels on either side. Hebrew Bible prophets 
holding scrolls appear below, as if forming a foundation for 
Mary s throne; the relationship between the Hebrew Bible and 
the New Testament is an important theme in Christian art. The 
Virgin s toweringscale and the brilliant blue of her gown against

the gold-leaf background draw a viewer s eye to her; with her 
gesture she emphasizes the presence of her son. Like Byzantine 
painters, Cimabue uses linear gold elements to enhance her 
dignity, but in his hands the network of gold lines follows the line 
of her body instead of creating abstract patterns. The severe 
design and solemn expression are appropriate to the monumental 
scale of the painting. 

Later artists in Renaissance Italy, such as Lorenzo Ghiberti 
(see Chapter 15) and Giorgio Vasari (see Chapter 16) claimed 
that Cimabue was the teacher of Giotto di Bondone (ca. 
1267-1336/37), one of the key figures in the history of art. If so, 
Giotto may have learned from him the “Greek Manner” in which 
Cimabue worked. Some scholars believe that Giotto also worked

13.17 Giotto, Madonna Enthroned, ca. 1310. Tempera on panel,

at Assisi, while documents tell us that Giotto worked in Rome 
where examples of both ancient and Early Christian art were 
available for artists to study. Equally important, however, was the 
influence of the Pisani—Nicolo and Giovanni—with their blend 
of classicism and Gothic naturalism to express strong emotional 
content. (See figs. 13.8 and 13.9.) 

We can see Giottos relationship to, but difference from, 
Cimabue in a tall altarpiece showing the Madonna Enthroned, 
which he painted around 1310 for the church of All Saints 
(Ognissanti) in Florence (fig. 13.17). Like Cimabues Santa Trinita 
Madonna, Giotto depicts the Queen of Heaven and her son 
enthroned among holy figures against a gold background. The 
Virgins deep blue robe and huge scale bring a viewers eye 
directly to her and to the Christ Child in her lap. All the other 
figures gaze at them, both signaling and heightening their impor¬ 
tance. Unlike Cimabue, Giotto models the figures in light, so that 
they appear to be solid, sculptural forms. Where Cimabue turns 
light into a network of golden lines, Giotto achieves a gradual 


movement from light into dark, so that the figures appear to be 
three-dimensional forms. 

The throne exhibits some features of contemporary Italian 
architecture, such as the high pointed arches, though Giotto uses 
them to create a nichelike structure. This encloses the Madonna 
on three sides, setting her apart from the gold background, 
and defines the space that she inhabits. Giotto further suggests 
space by placing angels kneeling before the throne and by the 
overlapping figures of saints, who seem to stand behind one 
another on a level surface. The throne s lavish ornamentation 
includes a feature that is especially interesting: the colored marble 
surfaces of the base and of the quatrefoil within the gable. Such 
illusionistic stone textures had been highly developed by ancient 
painters (see fig. 7.56), and their appearance here is evidence that 
Giotto was familiar with whatever ancient murals could still be 
seen in medieval Rome. 

THE ARENA CHAPEL IN PADUA Giottos innovative ideas 
about light and space were accompanied by a gift for storytelling. 
Although scholars are not certain that he was among the artists 
who painted the nave frescoes at Assisi, his fresco cycles share 
formal and narrative characteristics with those images (see fig.

13.2). Of Giottos surviving murals, those in the Arena, or 
Scrovegni, Chapel in Padua, painted in 1305 and 1306, are won¬ 
derfully preserved and recently restored. It is known variously as 
the Arena Chapel because the site once housed a Roman arena, 
and the Scrovegni Chapel because it was built by Enrico 
Scrovegni, a Paduan banker, next to his palace, where he intended 
it to serve as his burial chapel. Dedicated to “Our Lady of 
Charity”, the structure is a one-room hall covered with a barrel 
vault (fig. 13.18). 

Giotto and his assistants painted the whole chapel from floor 
to ceiling in the fresco technique. A blue field with gold stars 
symbolic of Heaven dominates the barrel vault, below which the 
walls are divided into three registers or horizontal rows. Each 
register contains rectangular fields for narrative scenes represent¬ 
ing the lives of the Virgin and Christ. The Annunciation appears 
at the altar end of the room; this represents the archangel Gabriel 


announcing to Mary that she has been chosen to bear the son of 
God. The theme commemorates the Incarnation of Christ and 
marks the beginning of the plan of Salvation, according to 
Catholic belief. At the other end of the chapel, Giotto depicted 
the Last Judgment (the events predicted for the end of time). At 
the foot of the Last Judgment, Giotto has included the figure of 
the donor, Enrico Scrovengi, offering his chapel to the Virgin and 
angels (see page 436). Along the length of the wall, the top regis¬ 
ter depicts stories of the early life of Mary and her parents; the 
center register focuses on stories of Christ s life and miracles; and 
the lowest register depicts his Passion, Death, and Resurrection. 
Below the narratives, the walls resemble marble panels inter¬ 
spersed with reliefs, but everything is painted. 

One scene in the middle register, Christ Entering Jerusalem , 
depicts the event commemorated by Christians on Palm Sun¬ 
day (fig. 13.19). The Gospels report that the citizens welcomed

13.20 Giotto, The Lamentation , Arena (Scrovegni) Chapel, Padua. 1305-06. Fresco 


Jesus with palm fronds and cheers as he entered Jerusalem riding 
a donkey; Christ s arrival on a humble mount fulfilled a Hebrew 
Bible prophecy. Giotto places the entire scene in the foreground of 
his image, which brings the events very close to a viewer. Further¬ 
more, Giotto gives his forms such a strong three-dimensional 
quality that they almost seem as solid as sculpture. The rounded 
forms create the illusion of space in which the actors exist. 

Giotto deliberately leaves the setting spare for this event, 
except for the trees in which children climb and the city gate on 
the right. His large simple forms, strong grouping of figures, and 
the limited depth of his stage give his scenes a remarkable spatial 
coherence. The massed verticals of the block of apostles on the 
left contrast with the upward slope of the crowd welcoming Jesus 
on the right; but Jesus, alone in the center, bridges the gap 
between the two groups. His isolation and dignity, even as he 
rides the donkey toward the city where he will die, give the paint¬ 
ing a solemn air. 

Giotto s skill at perfectly matching composition and meaning 
may also be seen in the scenes on the lowest register, which focus 
on the Passion. A viewer gazing at these frescoes sees them 


straight on, so the painter organizes the scenes to exploit that rela¬ 
tionship. One of the most memorable of these paintings depicts 
the Lamentation, the moment of last farewell between Jesus and 
his mother and friends (fig. 13.20). Although this event does not 
appear in the Gospels, by the end of the Middle Ages versions of 
this theme had appeared in both Byzantine and in Western 
medieval art. 

The tragic mood of this Lamentation, found also in religious 
texts of the era, is created by the formal rhythm of the design as 
well as by the gestures and expressions of the participants. The 
low center of gravity and the hunched figures convey the somber 
quality of the scene, as do the cool colors and bare sky. With 
extraordinary boldness, Giotto sets off the frozen grief of the 
human mourners against the frantic movement of the weeping 
angels among the clouds. It is as if the figures on the ground are 
restrained by their obligation to maintain the stability of the com¬ 
position, while the angels, small and weightless as birds, are able 
to move—and feel—freely. 

Once again, the simple setting heightens the impact of the 
drama. The descending slope of the hill acts as a unifying element

that directs attention toward the heads of Christ and the Virgin, 
which are the focal point of the scene. Even the tree has a twin 
function. Its barrenness and isolation suggest that all of nature 
shares in the sorrow over Christ s death. Yet it also carries a more 
precise symbolic message: It refers to the Tree of Knowledge, 
which the sin of Adam and Eve had caused to wither and which 
was to be restored to life through Christ s sacrificial death. 

Giotto s frescoes in the Arena Chapel established his fame 
among his contemporaries. In the Divine Comedy , written around 
1315, the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri mentions the rising 
reputation of the young Florentine: "Once Cimabue thought to 
hold the field as painter, Giotto now is all the rage, dimming the 
luster of the others fame.” (See www.myartslab.com. ) Giotto 
continued to work in Florence for 30 years after completing the 
chapel frescoes, in 1334 being named the architect of Florence 
cathedral, for which he designed the campanile (see figs. 13.10 and 
13.12). His influence over the next generation was inescapable and 
was felt by artists all over Italy. 


Siena: Devotion to Mary in Works 
by Duccio and Simone 

Giotto s slightly older contemporary Duccio di Buoninsegna of 
Siena (ca. 1255-before 1319) directed another busy and influential 
workshop in the neighboring Tuscan city of Siena. The city of 
Siena competed with Florence on a number of fronts—military, 
economic, and cultural—and fostered a distinct identity and 
visual tradition. Its wealth came from agriculture and trade. After 
a key military victory against Florence in 1260, Siena took the 
Virgin Mary as its protector and patron. The Sienese chose a rep¬ 
resentative form of government—a republic—directed by the Nove 
(the Nine), who were chosen from the elite merchants of the city. 
By the end of the thirteenth century, this government had taken 
up the project of building a town hall (fig. 13.21), the Palazzo 
Pubblico, as an expression of their city’s wealth and status. 

Begun by 1298, the Palazzo Pubblico served not only to house 
the city government, but to frame a public space, the Piazza del

From his Chronicle 

Duccio's Maesta (see fig. 13.22) stood on the main altar of Siena 
cathedral until 1306, when it was removed to the transept. It was sawed 
apart in 1771, and some panels were acquired subsequently by museums 
in Europe and the United States. This local history of about 1350 
describes the civic celebration that accompanied the installation of the 
altar piece in 1311. 

T hese paintings [the Maesta] were executed by master Duccio, son 
of Nicolo, painter of Siena, the finest artist to be found anywhere 
at his time. He painted the altarpiece in the house of the Muciatti out¬ 
side the gate toward Stalloreggi in the suburb of Laterino. On the 9th 
of June [1311], at midday, the Sienese carried the altarpiece in great 
devotion to the cathedral in a procession, which included Bishop 
Roger of Casole, the entire clergy of the cathedral, all monks and 


nuns of the city, and the Nine Gentlemen [Nove] and officials of the 
city such as the podesta and the captain, and all the people. One by 
one the worthiest, with lighted candles in their hands, took their 
places near the altarpiece. Behind them came women and children 
with great devotion. They accompanied the painting up to the cathe¬ 
dral, walking in procession around the Campo, while all the bells 
rang joyfully. All the shops were closed out of devotion, all through 
Siena many alms were given to the poor with many speeches and 
prayers to God and to his Holy Mother, that she might help to 
preserve and increase the peace and well being of the city and its juris¬ 
diction, as she was the advocate and protection of said city, and 
deliver it from all danger and wickedness directed against it. In this 
way the said altarpiece was taken into the cathedral and placed on the 
main altar. The altarpiece is painted on the back with scenes from the 
Old Testament and the Passion of Jesus Christ and in front with the 
Virgin Mary and her Son in her arms and many saints at the sides, the 
whole decorated with fine gold. The altarpiece cost 3000 gold florins.

Campo, where the citys economic, political, religious, and social 
life was played out. Both the timing and the character of the 
Palazzo Pubblico point to the city’s rivalry with Florence, which 
was then building the Palazzo della Signoria. Built of brick and 
stone, Siena’s Palazzo Pubblico rises to three stories and supports 
a tower, as does Florence’s Palazzo. It also terminates in castlelike 
battlements at the roofline. But it has many more windows and 
other openings, and a more ornamental and elegant facade. The 
tower, not completed until the 1340s, is intentionally taller than 
that of the Palazzo della Signoria. 

The city also concerned itself with adorning its cathedral, 
dedicated to the Virgin. For the high altar of the cathedral the 
directors of the cathedral works hired Duccio to paint a large 
altarpiece, called the Maesta as it depicts the Virgin and Child in 
Majesty (fig. 13.22). Commissioned in 1308, the Maesta was 
installed in the cathedral in 1311 amidst processions and celebra¬ 
tions in the city. (See Primary Source , above, and The Art 
Historian's Lens , page 455.) Duccio’s signature at the base of the 
throne expresses his pride in the work: “Holy Mother of God, be 
the cause of peace to Siena, and of life to Duccio because he has 
painted you thus. ” 

Painted in tempera, Duccio’s image measures approximately 
7 by 13 feet without its architectural frame and many subsidiary 
elements. It takes the shape of a polyptych, or multipaneled 
work. The regal figures of the Virgin and Child in the Maesta 
sit on a complex throne draped in golden cloth. The Virgin is by 
far the largest and most impressive figure in this assembly, 
swathed in the rich blue reserved for her by contemporary prac¬ 
tice. Surrounding her is a carefully balanced arrangement of saints 
and angels, each bearing a golden halo. In the front row kneel 
Siena’s other patron saints, all gesturing and gazing at her. The 
Virgin may seem much like Cimabue’s (see fig. 13.16) which 
Duccio probably knew, as both originated in the Greek manner. 



Duccio, however, relaxes the rigid, angular draperies of that tradi¬ 
tion so that they give way to an undulating softness. The bodies, 
faces, and hands of the many figures seem to swell with three- 
dimensional life as the painter explores the fall of light on their 


454 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 















The Social Work of Images 


T he report of the celebrations held in Siena when Duccio’s Maesta 
was installed in the city’s cathedral attests to the importance of 
this painting for the entire community. It was a source of pride for the 
citizens of Siena, but also a powerful embodiment of the Virgin’s pro¬ 
tection of the city. Although modern audiences expect to find and 
react to works of art hanging in museums, art historians have demon¬ 
strated that art served different purposes in late medieval Europe. Few 
in the West today believe that a work of art can influence events or 
change lives. But in fourteenth-century Europe, people thought about 
images in much more active terms. Art could be a path to the sacred 
or a helper in times of trouble. 

During a drought in 1 354, for example, the city fathers of Florence 
paraded a miracle-working image of the Virgin from the village of 
Impruneta through the city in hopes of improving the weather. People 
with illness or health problems venerated a fresco of the Annunciation 


in the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence; they gave gifts 
to the image in hopes of respite from their problems. When the plague 
came to Florence, artists were commissioned to paint scenes depicting 
St. Sebastian and other saints who were considered protectors against 
this deadly disease. 

Images were also called upon for help outside the sacred space of the 
church. Continuing a tradition begun in the fourteenth century, street 
corners in Italy are often adorned with images of the Virgin, to whom 
passersby may pray or show respect. Candles may be lit or gifts offered 
to such images in hopes of the Virgin’s assistance. Art historians are also 
studying how works of art functioned among late medieval populations 
to forge bonds among social groups and encourage group identity. For 
example, outside the confines of monasteries, groups of citizens 
formed social organizations that were dedicated to a patron saint, 
whose image would be an important element of the group’s identity.

forms. Byzantine painting preserved aspects of ancient illusion- 
ism, which inspired Duccio to a profound degree. Nonetheless, 
Duccio s work also reflects contemporary Gothic sensibilities in 
the fluidity of the drapery, the appealing naturalness of the 


figures, and the glances by which the figures communicate with 
each other. An important source of this Gothic influence was 
probably Giovanni Pisano, who worked in Siena from 1285 to 
1295 as the sculptor-architect in charge of the cathedral facade.

STORI AN ’ 













13.23 Duccio, Annunciation of the Death of the Virgin , from the Maesta Altar. Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, Siena 


Some evidence hints that Duccio may have traveled to Paris, 
where he would have encountered French Gothic style directly. 

In addition to the principal scene, the Maesta included on its 
front and back numerous small scenes from the lives of Christ and 
the Virgin. In these panels, Duccio s synthesis of Gothic and 
Byzantine elements exploits a new kind of picture space and, with 
it, a new treatment of narrative. The Annunciation of the Death of 
the Virgin (fig. 13.23), which originally stood above the main 
image on the front of the altarpiece, represents two figures 
enclosed by an architectural interior; Duccio implies space for the 
figures to inhabit by representing walls and ceiling beams as 
receding into depth (called foreshortening). His architecture 
integrates the figures within the drama. In a parallel scene to the 
Annunciation (see fig. 13.25, for comparison), this panel depicts 
the archangel Gabriel returning to the mature Virgin to warn her 
of her impending death. The architecture places the two figures in 
the same uncluttered room, but enframes them separately. Despite 
sharing the space, each figure is isolated. Duccio s innovative use 
of architecture to enhance the narrative of his paintings inspired 
his younger French contemporary, Jean Pucelle, who adapted this 
composition for the Annunciation in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux 
(see fig. 12.39). 


The architecture keeps its space-creating function even in the 
outdoor scenes on the back of the Maesta , such as in Christ 
Entering Jerusalem (fig. 13.24), a theme that Giotto had treated 
only a few years before in Padua. Where Giotto places Christ at 
the center of two groups of people, Duccio places him closer to 
the apostles and on one side of the composition. He conveys the 
diagonal movement into depth not by the figures, who have the 
same scale throughout, but by the walls on either side of the road 
leading to the city, by the gate that frames the crowd welcoming 
Christ, and by the buildings in the background. Where Giotto 
reduces his treatment of the theme to a few figures and a bare 
backdrop, Duccio includes not only detailed architectural ele¬ 
ments, some of which resemble contemporary Tuscan buildings, 
but also many figures, including one peering at the crowd in the 
streets from a first-floor window. Duccio gives a viewer a more 
complete description of the event than Giotto, whose work 
stresses the doctrinal and psychological import of the moment. 
The goals of the two painters differ, and so do the formal means 
they use to achieve them. 

Duccio trained the next generation of painters in Siena. One 
distinguished disciple was Simone Martini (ca. 1284-1344), who 
also worked in Assisi but spent the last years of his life in

Avignon, the town in southern France that served as the residence 
of the popes during most of the fourteenth century. In 1333, 
the directors of Siena cathedral commissioned Simone to 
make another altarpiece to complement Duccios Maesta. His 
Annunciation (fig. 13.25) in its restored cusped and gilded frame 
hints at what has been lost in the dismemberment of Duccio s 
Maesta , which had a complex Gothic frame. Simone s altarpiece, 
in the form of a triptych or three-part structure, depicts the 
Annunciation flanked by two local saints set against a brilliant gold 
ground. To connect her visually to the Maesta , Simone s Virgin 
sits in a similar cloth-covered throne and wears similar garments. 

In Simone s picture, the angel Gabriel approaches Mary from 
the left to pronounce the words “Ave Maria gratia plena Dominus 
tecum ” (“Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you”). These 
words are familiar to believers as a popular prayer. Simone 
renders the words in relief on the surface of this painting, cover¬ 
ing them in the same gold leaf that transforms the scene into a 
heavenly vision. Details like the marble floor, the lilies symbolic 
of purity, and the sumptuous garment worn by the angel add to 
the richness of the image. Simone adds an element of doubt to the 
narrative, as the Virgin responds to her visitor with surprise and 


pulls away from him. The dove of the Holy Spirit flies toward her 
in anticipation of her momentous acceptance of her role as the 
mother of Jesus, thereby beginning the process of Salvation. Like 
Giotto, Simone has reduced the narrative to its simplest terms, but 
like Duccio, his figures have a lyrical elegance that lifts them out 
of the ordinary and into the realm of the spiritual. 

Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti 

Another altarpiece commissioned for the cathedral at Siena takes 
a more down-to-earth approach to representing the life of the 
Virgin. This is the Birth of the Virgin (fig. 13.26) painted in 1342 
by Pietro Lorenzetti (active ca. 1306-1348). Pietro and his brother 
Ambrogio (active ca. 1317-1348), learned their craft in Siena in 
Duccio s workshop, though their work also shows the influence 
of Giotto. Pietro has been linked to work at Assisi, and Ambrogio 
enrolled in the painters’ guild of Florence in the 1330s. Like 
Simone s, Pietro s altarpiece is a triptych, though it has lost its 
original frame. In this triptych, Pietro has related the painted 
architecture to the real architecture of the frame so closely that the 
two are seen as a single system. Moreover, the vaulted room

where the birth takes place occupies two panels and continues 
unbroken behind the column that divides the center from the 
right wing. The left wing represents a small chamber which opens 
onto a Gothic facade. Pietro s achievement of spatial illusion here 
is the outcome of a development that began three decades earlier 
in the work of Giotto and Duccio. Pietro treats the painting 
surface like a transparent window through which—not on 
which—a viewer experiences a space comparable to the real 
world. Pietro uses the architecture in his painting to carve out 
boxes of space that his figures appear to inhabit, but he is also 
inspired by Giotto s technique of giving his figures such mass and 
weight that they seem to create their own space. His innovation 
served the narrative and liturgical needs of Siena cathedral by 
depicting another key moment in the life of the Virgin, her birth, 
which was also an important feast day in the Church. St. Anne 
rests in her childbed, while midwives attend the newborn Virgin 
and other women tend to the mother. The figure of the midwife 
pouring water for the baby’s bath seems to derive from the figure 
seen from the back in Giotto s Lamentation (see fig. 13.20). The 
father, Joachim, waits for a report of the birth outside the room. 


GOOD AND BAD GOVERNMENT Pietro s brother, Ambrogio 
Lorenzetti, combined these same influences in a major project 
for the Palazzo Pubblico, executed between 1338 and 1340. The 
ruling Council of Nine commissioned several local artists to 
adorn the building, including Simone Martini. For their council 
room, they hired Ambrogio to paint an allegory, or moralizing 
narrative, contrasting good and bad government. In the room 
where the council deliberated, these frescoes aimed to inspire its 
members to achieve good government. Although the negative 
example of the effects of Bad Government has been severely dam¬ 
aged, the frescoes that depict the positive example of Good 
Government are remarkably well preserved (fig. 13.27). On the 
short wall of the room, Ambrogio depicted the Allegory of Good 
Government as an assembly of figures personifying virtues who 
flank the large enthroned figure of the Common Good. To the 
left, another enthroned figure personifies Justice, who is inspired 
by Wisdom. Below the virtues stand 24 members of the Sienese 
judiciary under the guidance of the personification of Concord. 

On the long wall, the fresco of Good Government in the 
City (fig. 13.28) bears an inscription praising Justice and the many

benefits that derive from her. (See Primary Source , page 461.) In 
this fresco, Ambrogio renders an architectural portrait of Siena.

Government in the Country provides a view of the Sienese farm¬ 
land, fringed by distant mountains (fig. 13.29) and overseen by a 
personification of Security. It is a true landscape—the first since 
ancient Roman times (see fig. 7.55). It represents a sweeping view 
of the orderly hillside: vineyards, farms, and pastures result from 
a fruitful nature possessed by well-governed humans. Ambrogio 
observes the peasants at their seasonal labors, which support the 
life within the city, even as the countryside is safe for travelers, 
merchants, and pleasure-seekers. 


Artists and Patrons in Times of Crisis 

Ambrogio s ideal vision of the city and its surroundings reveals 
how the citizens of Siena imagined their government and their city 
at a moment of peace and prosperity. The first three decades of the 
fourteenth century in Siena, as in Florence, were a period of polit¬ 
ical stability and economic expansion, as well as of great artistic 
achievement. In the 1340s, however, both cities suffered a series of 
catastrophes whose effects were to be felt for many years.

Constant warfare pushed scores of banks and merchants into 
bankruptcy, internal upheavals shook governments, and there 
were repeated crop failures and famine. Then, in 1348, the pan¬ 
demic of bubonic plague—the Black Death—that spread 
throughout Europe wiped out more than half the population of 
the two cities (see map 13.2). Flea-infested rats swarmed into 
cities from the barren countryside in search of food and so spread 
the disease. Popular reactions to these events were mixed. Many 
people saw them as signs of divine wrath, warnings to a sinful 
humanity to forgo the pleasures of this earth. In such people, the 
Black Death intensified an interest in religion and the promise of 
heavenly rewards. To others, such as the merry company who 
entertain each other by telling stories in the Florentine humanist 
Giovanni Boccaccio’s (1313-1375) book the Decameron , finished 
around 1353, the fear of death intensified the desire to enjoy life 
while there was still time. (See www.myartslab.com .) 

Fate medieval people were regularly confronted with the 
inevitability and power of death. A series of frescoes painted on 
the walls of the Camposanto, the monumental cemetery building 
next to Pisa cathedral, offers a variety of responses to death. 
Because of its somber message, these frescoes were once dated 
after the outbreak of the plague, but recent research has pushed 
the date closer to the 1330s. The painter is not known, though 
some scholars attribute the work to a Pisan artist named 
Francesco Traini (documented ca. 1321-1363). The huge fresco 


cycle, which was damaged in 1944 as a result of bombings in 
World War II, included a powerful Last Judgment and an image 
called The Triumph of Death, which asserts that death comes to 
all, rich or poor, saint or sinner. In a particularly dramatic detail 
(fig. 13.30), the elegantly costumed men and women on horseback 
have suddenly come upon three decaying corpses in open coffins. 
Even the animals are terrified by the sight and smell of rotting 
flesh. The hermit St. Macarius, having renounced all earthly pleas¬ 
ures, points out the lesson of the scene. His scroll reads: “If your 
mind be well aware, keeping here your view attentive, your vain¬ 
glory will be vanquished and you will see pride eliminated. And, 
again, you will realize this if you observe that which is written. ” 
As the hermits in the hills above make clear, the way to salvation 
is through renunciation of the world in favor of the spiritual life. 
The artists style recalls the realism of Ambrogio Forenzetti, 
although the forms are harsher and more expressive. 

It is likely that the Forenzetti brothers perished in the Black 
Death of 1348-49, along with thousands of other people through¬ 
out Tuscany. Scholars have studied the impact of the plague on 
artists and patrons of works of art in the second half of the four¬ 
teenth century to determine its effect on style and subject matter. 
We can assume that many painters died, so the number of artists 
probably diminished. Documentary research reveals that the 
number of endowed chapels, tombs, and funeral masses rose as 
people worried about their mortality Many such burials and 


462 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 










endowments were made in mendicant churches, such as the 
Franciscan Santa Croce and the Dominican Santa Maria Novella 
in Florence. 

At Santa Maria Novella, a Florentine merchant named 
Buonamico Guidalotti, who died in 1355, provided funds in his 
will for a new chapterhouse for the Dominican community in 
which he could be buried. The chapel served as a meeting room 
for the friars and as such was painted with frescoes expressing the 
role of Dominicans in the struggle for salvation. A fresco on one 
of the walls of the Guidalotti Chapel, painted by Andrea Bonaiuti 
(also known as Andrea da Firenze, active 1346-1379) between 
1365 and 1367, depicts the actions of Dominicans to assure the 
access of the faithful to Heaven, hence its title: The Way of 
Salvation (fig. 13.31). In the lower section of the fresco, spiritual 
and temporal leaders gather before a representation of the then- 
unfinished cathedral of Florence. The fresco depicts a model of 
the church rather than its actual state of construction. Groups of 
Dominicans preach to the laity and convert heretics amidst black 
and white dogs (a punning reference to the order—the Domini 
canes , or the dogs of the Lord). On the upper right, some heedless 


aristocrats enjoy the pleasures of the senses, while at the center, a 
Dominican shows the more spiritually minded the path to 
Heaven, whose gate is guarded by St. Peter. Andreas fresco 
reveals the influence both of Ambrogio Lorenzetti s Allegory of 
Good Government (see fig. 13.27) and the fresco on the walls of 
the cemetery near Pisa cathedral (see fig. 13.30). Nonetheless, the 
fresco s symmetry and the sense of order reveal a didactic func¬ 
tion: It seeks legibility rather than illusion, and serenity rather 
than emotion. 

Florence, however, did not complete its cathedral in the 
fourteenth century, and it was not to enjoy the calm atmosphere 
portrayed in Andreas fresco. The plague returned in 1363, the 
political elite clashed with the papacy, and an uprising among the 
working classes created social and economic turmoil. The wealth¬ 
ier classes restored their power in 1381. Florence overcame these 
disasters to flourish in the fifteenth century as a center of eco¬ 
nomic energy, political astuteness, and cultural leadership. As the

would look to the art of Giotto and his contemporaries in their 
search for new forms of visual expression.

NORTHERN ITALY 

Political struggles did not disturb Venice in the fourteenth 
century. Unlike Florence, which was riven by warring factions, 
the city enjoyed political stability. Since 1297, it had closed off 
membership in the merchant oligarchy that participated in 
government, and the city’s leader (the Doge) was elected from this 
group. This created a stable social climate, so neither Venetian 
palaces nor their communal buildings required the defensive 
architecture seen in Florentine structures such as the Palazzo della 
Signoria (see fig. 13.15). A somewhat different atmosphere existed 
in Milan, west of Venice in Lombardy, where a monarchical gov¬ 
ernment lay in the hands of a single family with great dynastic 
ambitions. In Lombardy, the main political and cultural connec¬ 
tions were with northern Europe, which had important results for 
the type and the style of art produced there. 

Venice: Political Stability 
and Sumptuous Architecture 

The differing political situations in Florence and Venice affected 
palace design. Whereas the Florentine palace was solid and 
impenetrable, the Venetian equivalent is airy and open, full of 
windows and arcades that are anything but defensible. Venetian 
architects borrowed from Gothic, Byzantine, and Islamic prece¬ 
dents in an elegant display of the city’s wealth and security. When 
a larger meeting space was needed for the Great Council, the city 
decided to enlarge the Doge’s Palace near St. Mark’s cathedral in 
1340 (fig. 13.32). Work continued here until the mid-fifteenth 
century. In contrast to the fortresslike Palazzo della Signoria in 
Florence, the Doge’s Palace is open at the base, the weight of its 
upper stories resting on two stories of pointed arcades. The lower 
arcade provides a covered passageway around the building, the 
upper a balcony. The lavish moldings and the quatrefoils of the 
arcades give the structure an ornamentality accented by the dou¬ 
bling of the rhythm in the upper arcade. The walls of the structure 
are ornamented with stonework in a diamond pattern, making 
them both visually lighter and more ornate. 

Milan: The Visconti Family 
and Northern Influences 

Lombardy had a different political structure and a closer relation¬ 
ship with Gothic France, which found expression in its visual arts. 
The Visconti family had acquired great wealth from the products 
of this richly agricultural region. Besides controlling Lombardy, 
the Visconti positioned themselves among the great families of 
Europe through marriage ties to members of the Italian and 
European nobility. By 1395, Giangaleazzo Visconti had been 
named duke of Milan, had married the daughter of the king of 
France, and had wed his daughter to the French king’s brother, 
Louis, duke of Orleans. 

The authoritarian nature of Visconti rule in Milan may be seen 
in the tomb of Giangaleazzo s uncle Bernabo Visconti (fig. 13.33).

Completed around 1363, perhaps by the local sculptor Bonino da 
Campione (active ca. 1357-1397), the marble structure includes 
a sarcophagus that supports a sculpted figure of Bernabo on 
horseback. Though now in a museum, Bernabo s equestrian mon¬ 
ument originally stood over the altar of a church in Milan. The 
figure stands rather than sits on the horse, forcefully commanding 
the space over the high altar. The idea of the equestrian image of 


CHAPTER 1 3 ART IN THIRTEENTH- AND FOURTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 465 




















a ruler goes back to antiquity, with the Equestrian Statue of 
Marcus Aurelius (see fig. 7.33) visible in Rome throughout the 
Middle Ages. 

The ruling aristocracy of Europe claimed for themselves the 
prerogative of equestrian imagery. In this sculpture, Bernabo is 
rigid and formal in his bearing; originally the figure was covered 
with silver and gold leaf to further enhance its impressiveness. Yet 
the treatment of the horse, with its sensitive proportions and real¬ 
istically observed anatomy, points to a Lombard interest in the 
natural depiction of form, which may be a result of contact with 
contemporary French art. 

Bernabo s nephew, who deposed him to claim power, used the 
visual arts as part of his own campaign to be named duke of 
Milan. Giangaleazzo Visconti encouraged the construction of a 
new cathedral in Milan in 1386 and commissioned expensive illu¬ 
minated manuscripts like his French peers. His Book of Hours 
was begun around 1395 by Giovannino dei Grassi (active ca. 
1380-1398) and features numerous personal representations and 
references to the duke. The page in figure 13.34 begins one of the 
Psalms with an illuminated initial “D” wherein King David 
appears. David is both the author of the text and a good biblical 


exemplar of a ruler. An unfurling ribbon ornamented with the 
French fleur-de-lis forms the “D”; shields at the corners bear the 
Visconti emblem of the viper. Below the text appears a portrait of 
Giangaleazzo in the profile arrangement that was familiar from 
ancient coins. Although the portrait is naturalistic, it is set into an 
undulating frame that supports the rays of the sun, another 
Visconti emblem. Around the portrait Giovannino has painted 
images of stags and a hunting dog, paying great attention to the 
accurate rendering of these natural forms. Such flashes of realism 
amidst the splendor of the page reflect both the patrons and the 
artist s contribution to the developing International Gothic style. 
Commissioning such lavish books was an expression of the status 
and power that Giangaleazzo attempted to wield. His ambition to 
bring most of northern Italy under his control would profoundly 
affect the arts in Tuscany in the early fifteenth century. 

Starting from the local traditions of Italy and the inspiration of 
Byzantine and French Gothic style, Italian artists of the thirteenth 
and fourteenth centuries created works of art with pronounced 
elements of naturalism and featuring increasingly complex 
imagery. Their accomplishments provided a foundation for the 
artists of the subsequent century in Italy and the rest of Europe.

Artistic Innovations in 
Fifteenth-Century 
Northern Europe 



T he great cathedrals of Europe’s gothic era—the products 

of collaboration among church officials, rulers, and the laity—were 
mostly completed by 1400. As monuments of Christian faith, they 
exemplify the medieval outlook. But cathedrals are also monuments 
of cities, where major social and economic changes would set the stage for the 


modern world. As the fourteenth century came to an end, the 
medieval agrarian economy was giving way to an economy based 
on manufacturing and trade, activities that took place in urban 
centers. A social shift accompanied this economic change. Many 
city dwellers belonged to the middle classes, whose upper ranks 
enjoyed literacy, leisure, and disposable income. With these 
advantages, the middle classes gained greater social and cultural 
influence than they had wielded in the Middle Ages, when the 
clergy and aristocracy had dominated. This transformation had a 
profound effect on European culture, including the development 
of the visual arts. 

Cities such as Paris, London, Prague, Bruges, Barcelona, and 
Basel were home to artisans, dayworkers, and merchants as well 
as aristocrats. Urban economies based more on money and wages 
than landed wealth required bankers, lawyers, and entrepreneurs. 
Investors seeking new products and markets encouraged techno¬ 
logical innovations, such as the printing press, an invention with 
sweeping consequences. Some cities specialized in manufacturing 
specific goods, such as tapestries, or working in specific materials, 
such as metalworking (map 14 . 1 ). The raw materials for such 
products came from mines or farms from all over Europe, as well 
as Asia and Africa, following organized trade routes. Trade put 
more liquid wealth into the hands of merchants and artisans, who 

Detail of figure 14.16, Rogier van der Weyden, St. Luke Drawing the Virgin 


were emboldened to seek more autonomy from the traditional 
aristocracy, who sought to maintain the feudal status quo. 

Two of the most far-reaching changes concerned increased 
literacy and changes in religious expression. In the fourteenth 
century, the pope left Rome for Avignon, France, where his 
successors resided until 1378. On the papacy’s return to Rome, 
however, a faction remained in France and elected their own pope. 
This created a schism in the Church that only ended in 1417. But 
the damage to the integrity of the papacy had already been done. 
Such scandals undermined confidence in the institutional Church, 
leading many laypeople to turn to religious movements that 
encouraged them to read sacred texts on their own, to meditate on 
Scripture, and to seek a personal relationship with God. One 
such movement was called the Modern Devotion, but mendicant 
friars and other clerics also encouraged this new lay piety. 
Although the Church was not wholly comfortable with this 
phenomenon, the persuasiveness of the preachers supporting it 
spread the new outlook. These religious impulses and increasing 
literacy fueled a demand for books in vernacular (local) languages, 
including translations of Scripture. The printing press made 
books more available, further stimulating the development and 
spread of knowledge. 

Books and the ideas within them spread easily in an era when 
political changes brought significant changes to northern Europe 
whose boundaries now began to resemble those of present-day 
European nations. The Hundred Years’ War between France and

England finally ended in 1453. This allowed the French monarchy 
to recover, but civil war kept England politically unstable until 
late in the fifteenth century. French kings, however, had to 
contend with their Burgundian cousins, who controlled the trad¬ 
ing hub of northern Europe: the rich lands of Flanders in the 
southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium) and the northern 
Netherlands (present-day Holland). Indeed, Duke Philip the 
Good of Burgundy (r. 1419-1467) was one of the most powerful 
men of the century. 

Duke Philip s son, Charles, wanted to create his own kingdom 
out of the regions he inherited, a matter on which he unsuccess¬ 
fully petitioned the Holy Roman emperor. The emperor had 
nominal control of much of Central Europe, but local rulers 
within this region often flouted his authority. On the Iberian 
peninsula, the marriage between Queen Isabella of Castile and 
King Ferdinand of Aragon created a unified Spanish kingdom 
that became increasingly powerful. Competition among the 


regions of Europe for trade routes led to the voyages of 
Christopher Columbus, which would enrich the Spanish crown 
and bring European culture to another hemisphere. 

A new style of visual art that stressed naturalism accompanied 
these political and social changes. As in the medieval era, aristo¬ 
crats and churchmen continued to commission works, but the 
new ranks of society—bureaucrats and merchants—also became 
art patrons. For the merchants and middle-class patrons in urban 
centers, painters made images in a new medium with a new char¬ 
acter. Using oil paints, artists in the Netherlands made paintings 
that still astonish viewers today by their close approximation to 
optical reality. By midcentury, this strongly naturalistic style 
became the dominant visual language of northern Europe, attract¬ 
ing patrons from all classes and many countries. 

This transition was gradual and by no means universal. Faced 
with a growing middle class, the traditional aristocracy attempted 
to maintain their privileges and status. Among the aristocratic 


470 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 












courts of France, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and the 
Burgundian Netherlands, many of which were linked by treaty or 
marriage, a preference emerged for a highly refined form of 
Gothic art, which has been termed International Gothic. Yet 
within these courtly images were the seeds of the heightened 
naturalism that would blossom in the fifteenth century 

COURTLY ART: 

THE INTERNATIONAL GOTHIC 

As the fourteenth century came to an end, aristocratic patrons 
throughout Europe indulged a taste for objects made of sumptu¬ 
ous materials with elegant forms, based on the Gothic style. The 
latter had been born in France and was linked with the powerful 
French monarchy, so its latest manifestation owed a great deal to 
the forms and traditions of France. Cosmopolitan courts such as 
Avignon and Paris attracted artists from many regions and 
allowed them to exchange ideas. These circumstances produced 
the style historians call the International Gothic. The artists of the 
International Gothic also adapted some elements from four¬ 
teenth-century Italy, including devices to imply spatial settings 
borrowed from Duccio and Pietro Lorenzetti, and certain themes 
and compositions, such as aristocrats enjoying the countryside 
(see figs. 13.30 and 13.31). The chronological limits of this style 
are somewhat fluid, as some objects ascribed to the International 
Gothic date from the mid-fourteenth century, whereas others 
may date as late as the mid-fifteenth. 

International Gothic artists came from Italy, France, Flanders, 
Germany, Spain, Bohemia, Austria, England, and elsewhere. They 
produced works of exquisite craftsmanship, with sometimes very 
complex iconographies, out of expensive materials for elite 
patrons. In making these objects, artists followed Gothic princi¬ 
ples, which used geometric patterns to impose order on natural 
forms to idealize them (as we saw for example in fig. 12.19, in the 
work of Villard de Honnecourt), but they added details directly 
observed from nature, too. Many scholars see the detailed natu¬ 
ralism that appears in the International Gothic as a key stimulus 
for the more thoroughgoing naturalism of the early Flemish 
painters and their followers in the fifteenth century. 

Sculpture for the French Royal Family 

The French royal family was among the most active patrons of the 
International Gothic. King Charles V had three brothers, all of 
whom were active patrons of the arts. The youngest of them, 
Philip the Bold, became duke of Burgundy in 1363; then he added 
the title of count of Flanders through his marriage to Margaret of 
Male. Through these territorial acquisitions, the dukes of 
Burgundy became powerbrokers in the military and economic 
struggles of the fifteenth century. Works of art helped further 
Philip s status, providing an important example for his successors. 

In his domain of Burgundy, Duke Philip the Bold established 
a Carthusian monastery, the Chartreuse de Champmol, outside 


Dijon. Although the monastery was almost completely destroyed 
in the late eighteenth century during the anti-aristocratic riots of 
the French Revolution, some parts of the building survive. For the 
construction of this monastery, which Philip intended to serve as 
his family mausoleum, he assembled a team of artists, many of 
them from the Netherlands. Chief among them was the sculptor 
Claus Sluter (ca. 1360-1406) who came from Brussels. Remnants 
of Sluter s work at the Chartreuse de Champmol include tombs, 
portal sculptures and other sculptural projects. 

THE WELL OF MOSES AT THE CHARTREUSE DE 
CHAMPMOL The most emblematic among those of the 
International Gothic style is The Well of Moses (fig. 14.1). At one 
time, this hexagonal well, surrounded by statues of Hebrew Bible 
prophets, was topped by a life-size Calvary scene with Christ on 
the Cross flanked by his mother and saints. This served as a visual 
expression of the fulfillment by the New Testament of the Hebrew 
Bible. With the loss of most of the Calvary scene, however, it is 
the six figures of Hebrew Bible prophets on the base who must 
represent Sluter s achievement for us. Supported on a narrow con¬ 
sole and framed by slim colonnettes. The majestic Moses wears a 
long flowing beard and drapery that envelops his body like an 
ample shell. The swelling forms of the prophets seem to reach out

CHAPTER 1 4 ARTISTIC INNOVATIONS IN FIFTEENTH-CENTURY NORTHERN EUROPE 471 





into the surrounding space to interact directly with a viewer. Each 
prophet carries a scroll with texts that predict the death of Christ, 
and each bears an attribute that identifies him. To Moses 5 right 
stands King David, wearing the crown and robe of monarchy. The 
intense, staring Moses bears a pair of horns to identify him; this 
detail arose from a mistranslation of the Hebrew word for “ray 55 
during the early Christian period. The horns describe Moses, 
holding the tablets of the Ten Commandments, after his encounter 
with God on Sinai. The lifelike feeling created by Moses 5 size and 
naturalistic rendering must have been greatly enhanced by the 
colors added to the stone by the painter Jean Malouel; these have 
now largely disappeared. Sluter gave one of the prophets a pair of 
bronze spectacles to further the connection to the real world. This 
attachment to the specific distinguishes Sluters naturalistic style 
from that of the earlier period and is one of the hallmarks of the 
International Gothic. 

THE ALTARPIECE AT THE CHARTREUSE DE CHAMPMOL 

In addition to sculptural projects for the Chartreuse de 
Champmol, Duke Philip commissioned an altarpiece for its 


church that was executed between 1394 and 1399. The ensemble 
included an elaborately carved relief for the central section by 
Jacques de Baerze (showing the Adoration of the Magi, the Cruci¬ 
fixion, and the Entombment) and wings by the Flemish painter 
Melchior Broederlam (ca. 1355-1410) (fig. 14.2). (Their complex 
shape results from the format of the central section.) Each panel 
of these wings depicts two scenes from the infancy of Christ: 
The left wing depicts the Annunciation and the Visitation (when 
the pregnant Virgin visited her cousin Elizabeth, who was herself 
expecting John the Baptist); the right, the presentation of the 
infant Christ to the rabbi Simeon in the Temple and the flight 
of the holy family from Bethlehem into Egypt to escape the per¬ 
secution of Herod. The painter uses landscape and architectural 
elements to define the narratives and to fill in available spaces. 
Broederlam arranges the architecture so a viewer can see inside, 
as if into a dolls house; the spatial arrangements, however, derive 
from Duccio and the Lorenzetti (see figs. 13.23 and 13.26). Details 
of the landscape are out of scale with the figures, yet the panels 
convey a strong feeling of depth thanks to the subtlety of the 
modeling. The softly rounded shapes and the dark, velvety

shadows create the illusion of weight, as do the ample, loosely 
draped garments, reminiscent of the sculpture of Sluter. 

Broederlams panels display another feature of the 
International Gothic style: the realistic depiction of small details. 
Observing nature in detail was certainly not new; similar realism 
may be seen in some Gothic sculpture (see fig. 12.28) and among 
some droleries (small designs, often of fables or scenes from 
everyday life) in the margins of manuscripts such as the Hours of 
Jeanne d’Evreux (fig. 12.39). In Broederlam s Annunciation panel, 
such realism is evident in the carefully rendered foliage and flow¬ 
ers of the enclosed garden behind Gabriel at the left. In the right- 
hand panel, touches of naturalistic detail include the delightful 
donkey, the tiny fountain at its feet, and the rustic figure of St. 
Joseph, who looks like a simple peasant in contrast with the deli¬ 
cate, aristocratic beauty of the Virgin. These painstaking touches 
give Broederlam s work the flavor of an enlarged miniature rather 
than of a large-scale painting, even though the panels are more 
than 5 feet tall. But they do more than merely endow the image 
with small flashes of realism: They contribute to its meaning. In 
the left-hand panel, for example, the lily signifies Mary s virginity, 
as does the enclosed garden next to her, which is inspired by a 
metaphor from the biblical Song of Songs: “A garden enclosed is 
my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. ” Even 
the architecture contributes to the meaning. The contrasting 
Romanesque and Gothic buildings stand for the Hebrew Bible 
and New Testament respectively. Broederlam both enchants and 
instructs in this painting. 

Illuminated Manuscripts: Books of Hours 

Broederlam s work in these painted altarpiece wings reflects the 
influence of manuscript illuminations, which had been an impor¬ 
tant medium in northern Europe throughout the Middle Ages. 
The French court prized these expensive, custom-made objects. 
Philip the Bold s older brother, Jean, duke of Berry in central 
France, commissioned many of these sumptuous books, amassing 
a huge collection in his lifetime. 

The luxurious book of hours known as Les Tres Riches Heures 
du Due de Berry (The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry), is 
one of the most famous of the duke s books and a prime example 
of the International Gothic style. The artists responsible for it 
were Pol de Limbourg and his two brothers, Herman and Jean. 
They were introduced to the court by their uncle, Jean Malouel, 
the painter who had applied the colors to Sluters The Well of 
Moses , and came to share an appointment as court painters to the 
duke, reflecting the high regard they enjoyed. One or more of 
the brothers must have visited Italy, for their work includes 
numerous motifs and whole compositions borrowed from the 
artists of Tuscany and Lombardy. 

The Limbourg Brothers began the Tres Riches Heures about 
1413 and left it unfinished when they died in 1416, probably of 
the plague. As a result, some pages were completed long after 
their deaths. The most famous pages in the book are devoted to 
the calendar and depict human activities and the cycle of nature. 


Such image cycles, originally consisting of 12 single figures each 
performing an appropriate seasonal activity, were an established 
tradition in medieval art. In this manuscript, the calendar pages 
depict aristocrats and peasants in detailed and elegant images in 
activities appropriate to the month represented. 

The page for January, for example (fig. 14.3), shows a scene of 
feasting, a traditional choice for the cold winter months. But the 
Limbourgs flatter their patron by depicting the duke himself at 
the table, seated before a large fireplace, whose wicker screen 
serves to frame him. Wearing a fur cap and embroidered blue gar¬ 
ment, Duke Jean sits beneath a wall hanging adorned with his coat 
of arms and swans, his personal emblem. Before him, a feast is laid 
out on golden plates and sumptuous vessels. He discourses with a 
clergyman seated near him, while expensively dressed courtiers

wait on the duke or warm themselves at the fire. Painted tapestries 
hang on the wall next to and above the mantel. Using brilliant col¬ 
ors, the artists reproduce the table setting, the items on the menu, 
the patterns in the draperies, even the texture of the floor cover¬ 
ing. Such detailed observation records the pleasures of the winter 
season for the duke, who could literally see himself in the page. 

The chronological elements above the interior scene on this 
page are unfinished, but they are complete in another page of the 
book for the summer season. The calendar page for July (fig. 14.4) 
notes the passage of time in several ways: A semicircular section at 
the top marks the days numerically and includes the astrological 
signs for the month. Below this, the labor of the month is per¬ 
formed, as peasants harvest wheat and shear sheep in the fields, 
beneath a precisely rendered castle, Jean de Berrys Chateau du 
Clain (Poitiers), now destroyed but well documented. The page 
depicts the orderly harvesting of a fruitful earth by the peaceful 


peasantry for the eyes of the man who owns the castle. This 
idealized view of the social order of feudalism is achieved by 
combining the portrait of the castle and naturalistic details of the 
sheep or the scythes with an artificial space that rises up the 
picture plane rather than receding into depth. The carefully 
crafted composition links the three major zones into triangular 
elements that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The jewel-like 
color and splashes of gold leaf in the calendar zone contribute to 
the sumptuous effect of the page. The prestige of the patron and 
the sheer innovation of the images, especially on the calendar 
pages, in the Tres Riches Heures inspired many later copies. 

Bohemia and England 

Other courts and regions in Europe shared the French taste for 
the International Gothic. In Central Europe, the city of Prague, 


474 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 











the capital of Bohemia, became a major cosmopolitan center 
thanks to Emperor Charles IV (1316-1378). Charles was educated 
in Paris at the court of the French king Charles IV, whose daugh¬ 
ter he married and in whose honor he changed his name from 
Wenceslaus. After returning to Prague and succeeding his father 
as king of Bohemia, Charles was named Holy Roman emperor by 
the German Electors at Aachen in 1349 and crowned as such in 
Rome in 1355. 

Charles wanted to make Prague a center of learning, and in 
1348 he established a university modeled on the one in Paris. It 
soon attracted many of the best minds in Europe. He also became 
a patron of the arts and founded a guild for artists. In addition to 
encouraging local talent, Charles brought artists from all over 
Europe to his city. In his castle of Karlstein, just outside of 
Prague, he built a chapel dedicated to the Holy Cross that 


imitated Louis IX s Sainte Chapelle (fig. 12.32). Instead of 
stained glass, however, the walls of this chapel were covered in 
paintings done by Master Theodoric, the first head of the 
painters’ guild of Prague. The paintings were executed between 
1357 and 1367. 

St. Matthew and the Angel (fig. 14.5) comes from this project. 
As one of the authors of the Gospels, Matthew holds a book 
while an angel whispers in his ear. A long-standing medieval tra¬ 
dition assigned symbols to each of the four Evangelists, in 
Matthew s case an angel. Master Theodoric makes the angel an 
active participant in the work of the saint. Matthew himself is 
rendered as a three-dimensional figure, whose blue garment falls 
across his body in softly modeled folds of drapery. This style 
probably derives from Theodoric s study of Italian artists, either 
in his native Austria or Prague.

In a pattern typical among late medieval dynasties, the 
emperor Charles IV s daughter, Anne of Bohemia, married the 
English king Richard II in 1382. Richard, who ruled from 1377 to 
1399, is the figure depicted in a painting called (for the collector 
who once owned it) The Wilton Diptych (fig. 14.6). A diptych is a 
double panel that opens on a hinge at the center like a book. This 
diptych represents King Richard II kneeling before his patron 
saints to venerate the Virgin Mary and her Child. The gazes of the 
figures connect across the panels as they stare at the Virgin and 
Child, who playfully reaches out toward the king. Angels accom¬ 
pany the elegant figure of the Virgin, who appears like a queen 
surrounded by her palace guard, yet because the angels wear 
badges with emblems of Richard himself, it is his guard that 
surrounds her. The sumptuous colors and tall weightless figures 
stand in an eternal setting defined by a beautifully tooled gold 
background. Yet the drapery worn by the angels is modeled in the 
same natural light as Master Theodoric s St. Matthew. Scholars are 
still debating whether the unidentified artist who achieved this 
combination of Gothic otherworldliness and natural observation 
came from France, England, Bohemia, or somewhere else. 


URBAN CENTERS AND THE NEW ART 

Many of the artists whom the patrons in the courts preferred for 
their projects came from the cities of the southern Netherlands: 
Bruges, Brussels, Ghent, and Tournai. These were centers of 
international commerce in whose streets many languages could be 
heard as merchants from all over Europe gathered to do business. 
They were very jealous of their status as independent entities with 
special privileges to govern themselves, set trade tariffs, and estab¬ 
lish militias. Their claims for independence often clashed with the 
desires of aristocratic overlords to tax and control their 
inhabitants. Buildings like the Town Hall of Bruges (fig. 14.7), 
built between 1376 and 1402, were designed to provide a setting 
for town councils and to serve as symbols of the independence 
and privileges the cities claimed. The Town Hall is one of the 
earliest such structures in northern Europe. Set on a major town 
square, it looks like an ecclesiastical structure, with its high gabled 
roof, traceried windows, and vaulted interior. The facade 
emu-lates Gothic churches, too, with its many sculpted figures 
depicting not saints, but the local rulers, the counts of Flanders.

1 4.7 Facade of Bruges Town Hall. Begun 1376 


(The building was damaged during the French Revolution, and 
the statues on the facade today are modern.) While the interior of 
the structure functioned as a council hall for self-rule and issuing 
judgments, the exterior sculpture expressed the nominal rule of 
the counts of Flanders. 

It is in the cities of Flanders that the beginnings of an artistic 
revolution may be seen. Working either for courts or for citizens, 
artists began to make images in oil paint that represent sacred 
figures as if they existed in the natural world, giving tangible form 
to spiritual concepts. 

Robert Campin in Tournai 

An early pioneer of this naturalistic revolution is Robert Campin 
(1378-1444), the foremost painter in Tournai, an important trade 
center in southwestern Belgium. Campin ran a busy workshop, 
from which several other successful painters emerged, including 
Rogier van der Weyden. 

THE ME RODE TRIPTYCH The most famous work attributed 
to Campin is the Merode Triptych (fig. 14.8), dated on the basis of 
style to around 1425. The name derives from an early owner of 


the painting, but the subject of the central panel is the 
Annunciation, frequently depicted in earlier Christian art. 
Typically, those earlier representations of the Annunciation set 
the event in an ecclesiastical building (see fig. 14.2) or other sacred 
space (see fig. 13.25), but Campin places the Virgin and the angel 
Gabriel in what appears to be the main room of a bourgeois 
house, complete with open shutters, well-used fireplace, and 
cushioned bench. Despite the supernatural events, a viewer has 
the sense of actually looking through the surface of the panel into 
a world that mimics reality. Campin uses several devices to create 
this effect. He fits the objects and figures into boxes of space 
aligned with the parts of the triptych. Sometimes the fit isn’t com¬ 
fortable, but he renders details in such a way as to make every 
object as concrete as possible in its shape, size, color, and texture. 
He also paints two kinds of light. One is of a diffused kind that 
creates soft shadows and delicate gradations of brightness; the 
other is more direct and enters through the two round windows, 
casting shadows on the wall. Campin’s color scheme, with its 
muted tonality, unifies all three panels; his bright colors have rich¬ 
ness and depth, and he achieves smooth transitions from lights 
into darks. These effects were made possible by the use of oil. (See 
Materials and Techniques , page 479.) Although medieval artists

had knowledge of oil paint, Campin and his contemporaries 
expanded its possibilities for painting on panels. Its use allowed 
him to create a much more thorough illusion of reality than the 
flashes of natural detail seen in the work of court artists. 

Campin was no court painter but a townsman who catered to 
the tastes of fellow citizens, such as the two donors shown here 
piously kneeling outside the Virgin s chamber. A coat of arms 
painted in the window of the central panel points to a family of 
merchants who had settled in Tournai by 1427. Obviously they 
were wealthy enough to commission this triptych, probably for 
their own dwelling, as it is too small for installation in a public 
church. Perhaps it was this function that inspired the artist to 
break with tradition in the picture. This Annunciation takes place 
in a fully equipped domestic interior with figures that are ren¬ 
dered as real people, with mass and weight. The drapery of their 
garments falls in deep folds, anchoring the figures to the floor, as 
in the sculpture of Claus Sluter (see fig. 14.1). Gabriel adopts a 
not-quite-kneeling, not-quite-standing position as he raises his 
right hand to speak. Mary s red dress draws attention to her as she 
sits on the floor, book in hand. Between them, a table supports 
another book, a vase of lilies, and a candle. Above and behind 
Gabriel, the tiny figure of a baby holding a cross, who must be 
Christ, floats downward toward Mary. In the left wing panel, the 
donors kneel in a garden, as though looking through the open 
door to witness this event. The whole effect is of time frozen: 
Something important is about to happen. Where Simone Martini 


had rendered Gabriel and the Virgin as slim, weightless figures set 
against an eternal gold ground (see fig. 13.25), Campin depicts 
their substantial bodies in a recognizably earthly setting for the 
eyes of the donor couple. They see the event taking place in their 
world, not in Heaven. 

The right wing panel depicts Joseph, the carpenter, at work, 
though just what he is making is debatable. Scholars have identi¬ 
fied the mysterious boxlike object on the window ledge as a 
mousetrap, an object that the Christian theologian St. Augustine 
used metaphorically to explain Gods plan for salvation when he 
said, “The Cross of the Lord was the devils mousetrap.” The 
mousetrap could be a visual cue to the reason for Christ s incar¬ 
nation, which is about to occur in the central panel. Equally 
puzzling is the object in Joseph s hand, identified by some as a fire 
screen (like the one in the central panel) and by others as part of 
a press through which grapes are forced to make wine (which 
would refer to the wine used in the sacrament of the Eucharist). 

Such carefully chosen details have persuaded many scholars 
that Campin used these forms as symbols to convey spiritual 
messages. We have seen some of these symbols before: The flow¬ 
ers, for example, are associated with the Virgin as emblems of her 
purity and other virtues; they appeared in Simone Martinis 
Annunciation (see fig. 13.25). Interpreting other details, such as 
the smoking candle next to the vase of lilies, has been more 
difficult. Its glowing wick and the curl of smoke indicate that it 
has just been extinguished. To explain why a candle had been lit

Panel Painting in Tempera and Oil 


I n the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, painters worked with liquid 
pigments on wooden panels. The type of wood used varied from 
region to region, though oak panels were preferred in northern Europe 
because they could be sawn into thin planks to serve as supports 
for the paint. Pine, fruitwoods, and poplar were also used. Once the 
panels had been formed, and often inserted into a frame by a carpen¬ 
ter, the flat surface would be covered with a film of gesso (a type 
of fine plaster) to create a smooth surface for the image. Often an 
underdrawing would be laid onto the gesso as a guide for the painter 
or his assistants. 

For pigments, artists used oxides, plants, minerals, or semiprecious 
stones. They ground these materials into powders that had to be 
mixed with some sort of liquid medium to bind them to the panel. The 
basic medium of medieval panel painting had been tempera, in which 
the finely ground pigments were mixed (“tempered”) with diluted egg 
yolk. This produced a thin, tough, quick-drying coat that was well 
suited to the medieval taste for high-keyed flat color surfaces. 
However, in tempera the different tones on the panel could not be 
blended smoothly, and the progression of values necessary for three- 
dimensional effects was difficult to achieve. 

While medieval artists had used oil-based paints for special pur¬ 
poses, such as coating stone surfaces or painting on metal, artists like 
Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin in Flanders exploited it for panel 
paintings. Oil, a viscous, slow-drying medium, can produce a variety of 
effects, from thin, translucent films (called glazes) to a thick layer of 
creamy, heavy-bodied paint (called impasto). The tones can also yield 


a continuous scale of hues, including rich, velvety dark shades. Oil 
painting offers another advantage over egg tempera, encaustic, and 
fresco: It allows artists to change their minds and rework their paint¬ 
ings. As the use of oil paints spread across Europe, some artists 
adopted a mixed technique, using tempera for the base layers and 
covering these with oil glazes. Although pigments continued to be 
mixed with tempera for some time, oil has been the painter’s basic 
medium until very recently. 



Simone Martini s image of the 
angel Gabriel is painted in tempera, 
which dries quickly; consequently, 
the layers of paint do not blend, 
and individual strokes of the brush 
are visible on the surface. 


Campin s Gabriel is painted with 
oil, which dries slowly and is 
translucent. Each layer of color 
merges with the one below it to 
create a mirrorlike finish. 


on a sunny day, and what had snuffed out its flame, scholars have 
pointed to the arrival of Christ on a beam of light coming through 
the round window: In theological terms, the arrival of the true 
light (Christ) extinguishes the mundane one. 

The appearance in Campin s picture of so many carefully 
delineated objects suggests that these details constitute a symbolic 
program, which either the artist or the patron conceived. 
Theologians or scholars may have provided Campin with the 
more learned aspects of the symbolism, but it was the artist who 
found the means to express these complex ideas in symbolic terms 
using forms observed in the visible world. Modern scholars also 
debate the reasons why Campin and his contemporaries wanted 
to record the world with such fidelity. Some have argued that 
philosophies about nature and the natural world had changed, 
along with religious practices. Others have suggested that prag¬ 
matic merchants demanded directly observed renderings of things 
they could see. 

The Annunciation certainly has liturgical and theological 
import, but it is also a story about the conception of a child. The 
couple on the left kneel devoutly before the image of these events. 
From their perspective, the triptych may be an expression of their 
own desire for children or their reverence for the Holy Family 
as a model for their own. Such personalized approaches to holy 


figures and sacred dramas enlivened religious life at the end of the 
Middle Ages. Believers were encouraged in sermons, Passion 
plays, and written texts to visualize the sacred in terms they could 
understand and to meditate on events from Christ s life in order 
to increase their empathy and devotion. Although monks and 
nuns had long practiced such contemplation, the religious move¬ 
ment called the Modern Devotion helped to spread these ideas 
among the laity New texts, such as the Imitation of Christ by 
Thomas a Kempis, provided guidance for laypeople wishing to 
emulate Christ. Artists like Campin may have been responding to 
the call to see the physical world as a mirror of divine truths and 
to create moving and pious images of sacred events occurring in 
everyday environments. 

Jan van Eyck in Bruges 

The visual revolution achieved in paintings such as the Merode 
Triptych was recognized and admired not only by patrons in 
Flanders but also by patrons in Italy Italian observers provide the 
earliest external assessments of the Flemish innovators. They rec¬ 
ognized that the technical achievement of oil painting contributed 
to the striking naturalism and evocation of religious feeling in 
Flemish painting, and they credited the “invention” of oil painting

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 









to Jan van Eyck (1390-1441). (See www.myartslab.com. ) As a 
result, his is one of the more famous names of fifteenth-century 
art, and he is a figure about whom we know a good deal. 

Jan worked first for the count of Holland and then for the 
reigning duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, from 1425 until his 
death in Bruges in 1441. Both a townsman and a court painter, Jan 
was highly esteemed by Philip the Good, who occasionally sent 
him on diplomatic errands. Unusual for his time, he signed and 
dated several surviving pictures, which has allowed historians to 
identify his artistic output and to assign unsigned works to him 
based on the signed ones. 

THE GHENT ALTARPIECE The Ghent Altarpiece is one of the 
most famous of early Flemish paintings. From the moment it was 
installed in a chapel of the cathedral of St. John in Ghent (see fig. 
14.12), it began to draw a crowd. Albrecht Diirer visited it in 
1520, and much later artists like the nineteenth-century French 


painter Ingres drew inspiration from it. An inscription on the 
now-lost frame identified Jan van Eyck as the artist who finished 
this multipaneled altarpiece in May 1432 and alluded to the col¬ 
laboration of his older brother, Hubert, who died in 1426. The 
basic form of this complex altarpiece is a triptych (consisting of 
three hinged panels), but here each of the three units consists of 
four panels. Since the wings are also painted on both sides, the 
altarpiece contains a total of 20 images of various shapes and sizes. 
Discontinuities among the many panels suggest alterations took 
place as the work progressed. It appears that Jan took over a num¬ 
ber of panels left unfinished by Hubert, completed them, added 
some of his own, and assembled the whole at the request of the 
wealthy donor, Jodicus Vijd. Vijd s portrait with that of his wife, 
Elizabeth Borluut, appears on the outer panels of the altar when 
the triptych is closed (fig. 14.9). 

Their portraits appear on the lower tier with two other figures, 
each in a separate niche framed by painted Gothic tracery. Next to

the donors are John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, the 
patrons of the cathedral, painted in grisaille (a monochrome; in 
this case to imitate the grayish color of statues). The upper tier has 
two pairs of panels of different width. The artist has made a virtue 
of this awkward necessity by combining all four into one interior, 
whose foreshortened timber ceiling crosses all four panels. In 
addition to the continuous space, Jan heightens the illusion by 
painting shadows on the floor of the Virgin s chamber as if they 
were cast by the frames of the panels. Prophets and sibyls occupy 
an upper story, their prophecies written in Gothic script in scrolls 
above their heads. In such altarpieces, the wings stayed closed 
except on Sundays, specific feast days, and when other liturgically 
important moments required them to be opened. 

When the wings are opened (fig. 14.10) the viewer sees a 
detailed rendering of a celestial assembly: Across the bottom tier, 
groups of figures converge on a central image of an altar, upon 


which stands a haloed Lamb. This assembly includes angels, 
apostles, popes, theologians, virgin martyrs, hermits, pilgrims, 
knights, and judges (including, possibly, a reference to Jans 
employer, Duke Philip the Good). A verdant landscape provides 
the setting for this mystic Mass, with towers of numerous 
churches in the skyline. Above this earthly paradise reigns an 
imposing Court of Heaven, with the Lord in a bright red robe at 
the center. Planking him are Mary and John the Baptist. To the left 
and right, choirs of angels sing and play musical instruments. At 
the outer edges of this upper tier stand Adam and Eve, rendered 
as nudes in shallow niches, below grisaille images of Abel and 
Cain. The almost life-size nudes are portrayed with careful atten¬ 
tion to their anatomy and caressed by a delicate play of light and 
shade (fig. 14.11). 

The figures’ poses are comparable to those in Gothic manu¬ 
scripts, but here the artist breathes life into the forms by rendering

the textures and colors of the bodies with great accuracy. Seeing 
this work on the altar of the Vijd Chapel in Ghent cathedral (fig. 
14.12), a viewer could not fail to be impressed by the scale and 
setting of the painting. The tone and majesty of this ensemble are 
very different from the domestic intimacy of the Merode Triptych. 
The function of the altarpiece is to elucidate the liturgy per¬ 
formed in front of it. When open, its subject is the Mass itself, 
here shown in a paradisiacal setting. The number of books repre¬ 
sented and the many erudite inscriptions celebrating Christian 
learning suggest that a cleric or theologian may have advised Jan 
in developing the program. But Jan accomplished the difficult 
task of bringing the disparate panels together and welding them 
into an imposing and memorable experience. 

Jan s work is large in scale but full of naturally observed details 
and glowing color. His technique of building up color in layers of 
glazes results in highly saturated hues, while the slow, methodical 
application of paint blends brushstrokes to a mirrorlike finish. 
Jan offers a glimpse into Heaven to stimulate devotion. If, as 
some scholars believe, the whole altarpiece was set into a Gothic 
architectural frame, one meaning of the image becomes the 
importance of the Church itself as an institution and as a pathway 
to salvation.

SECULAR IMAGES Jan van Eyck also made purely secular 
paintings, fulfilling the commissions of the court and of the mid¬ 
dle-class citizens of Flemish towns. One example is Jan s Man in 
a Red Turban (fig. 14.13), signed and dated 1433, which represents 
a middle-aged man in a three-quarters pose whose face is framed 
by his dramatic headgear. Warm light bathes the distinctive face 
emerging from the dark background of this painting and reveals 
every detail of shape and texture with almost microscopic preci¬ 
sion. The artist does not explore the sitter s personality, yet the 
man gazes out of the picture to make eye contact with the viewer. 
This innovation, and the slight strain about the eyes which may 
come from gazing into a mirror, suggests that the painting may be 
a self-portrait. The self-consciousness that such a project demands 
may relate to the text painted on the frame: An inscription reads 
“ALS ICH KAN ” ("As I can” or “As best I can”). This motto 
appears on other works by Jan, too, perhaps challenging other 
artists to do better, for he has done all he can. Though transposed 
into Greek letters, the phrase is Flemish; this implies that Jan saw 
himself in competition with the ancients as well as with his con¬ 
temporaries. Whatever his reason may have been, we can read the 


motto as another sign of Jan s self-consciousness about his work 
as an artist and his place in history 

The next example demonstrates that Jan van Eyck s signatures 
complicate the task of interpreting his work. One of the most 
studied and yet still mysterious of his surviving images represents 
a man and a woman standing in a richly furnished room, equipped 
with a brass chandelier, a mirror, and a canopied bed (fig. 14.14). 
Jan signed the painting, not on the frame, as he did in many of his 
other paintings, but within the panel itself. Above the painted 
mirror in a formal script, the translated signature reads, “Jan van 
Eyck was here, 1434.” The features of the man, if not the lady are 
specific enough to be a portrait, and the image is unusual enough 
that scholars have been able to use later documents to identify the 
subject as Giovanni Arnolfini, an Italian merchant living in 
Bruges. For many years, scholars believed that his companion 
should be identified as Giovanna Cenami, Arnolfini s wife; recent 
research, however, makes this doubtful, as that marriage took 
place much later than 1434. 

Whatever their names, the painted couple appear in the 
main room of a fifteenth-century house that is somewhat more

expensively furnished than the room in the Merode Triptych. The 
two join hands, with the man raising his right hand as if in a 
solemn oath, seemingly quite alone in the room. In the mirror 
behind them, however, is the reflection of two men. Because the 
signature appears right above the mirror, many scholars believe 
that one of these men must be Jan van Eyck himself, perhaps the 
figure wearing the red headdress. The combination of the signa¬ 
ture, with its flourishes and phrasing, and the image of the men in 


the mirror suggests to some that Jan is acting as a witness to what¬ 
ever is occurring in the room. 

Traditionally, scholars have argued that this panel represents 
either the wedding or the engagement of the couple shown, either 
of which would have required a legal and financial contract 
between their two families. By this reading, the painting com¬ 
memorates the union of the couple. If so, the second man in the 
mirror may be the bride s father, who would have made the

Cyriacus of Ancona (1449) 

Rogier van der Weyden probably visited Italy , and sources reveal that 
he made several paintings for prominent Italian patrons, including the 
Este family of Ferrara. One ofRogier’s most discussed images in Italy 
drew the praise of Cyriacus of Ancona, a humanist and diplomat who 
had traveled widely in the service of Italian princes. 

A fter that famous man from Bruges, Johannes the glory of paint¬ 
ing [i.e., Jan van Eyck], Roger in Brussels is considered the 
outstanding painter of our time. By the hand of this most excellent 
painter is a magnificently wrought picture which the illustrious 
prince Lionello of Este showed me in Ferrara on July 8, 1449. In it 


one sees our first progenitors, and in a most pious image the ordeal of 
the Deposition of the God-Incarnate, with a large crowd of men and 
women standing about in deep mourning. All this is admirably 
depicted with what I would call divine rather than human art. There 
you could see those faces come alive and breathe which he wanted to 
show as living, and likewise the deceased as dead, and in particular, 
many garments, multicolored soldiers’ cloaks, clothes prodigiously 
enhanced by purple and gold, pearls, precious stones, and everything 
else you would think to have been produced not by the artifice of 
human hands but by all-bearing nature itself.

contract for the marriage of his daughter. The womans gesture to 
lift her heavy gown may suggest her wish for children, and the 
bed behind her may suggest the consummation of the marriage. 
Another recent interpretation sees the image as a commemoration 
of a wife who died giving birth, which might explain her general¬ 
ized features and the carved figure of St. Margaret, to whom preg¬ 
nant women prayed for safe delivery. 

Given the scenes secular nature, scholars have debated 
whether the realistic touches serve simply as an accurate record of 
an event and its domestic setting, or whether those details carry 
more symbolic weight. The couple may have taken off their shoes 
as a matter of custom, or the artist may want to imply that they 
are standing on “holy ground.” (This symbol has its origins in 
stories of Moses removing his sandals at the burning bush on 
Mount Sinai; that is, in the presence of God.) The little dog may 
be a beloved pet, like those in the January page of the Tres Riches 
Heures (see fig. 14.3), or it could be an emblem of fidelity. (Rides 
is Latin for faithfulness, the origin of the traditional dog name, 
Fido.) The other furnishings of the room suggest other questions. 
Here is yet another candle (in the chandelier) burning in broad 
daylight, but no holy figure is present as in the Merode Triptych. 
Pieces of fruit on the window sill may be expressions of the cou¬ 
ple s wealth, or refer to the temptation of Adam and Eve. Tiny 
images of Christ s Passion and Resurrection in the small medal¬ 
lions that surround the mirror sound the only unambiguously 
religious note in the picture. Scholars are still investigating the 
function and patronage of this image as they are now much less 
certain about the meaning of the image than they used to be. Jan 
van Eyck s carefully crafted image incites much scholarly fascina¬ 
tion, just as his work garnered much praise from his employer, the 
duke of Burgundy. 

Rogier van der Weyden in Brussels 

His status as a court painter exempted Jan van Eyck from the 
restrictions that governed other artists in Flemish towns. 
Regulations for the training of artists and the market for works of 
art came from the guilds, professional organizations of artists 
established to protect the interests of their members. Aspiring 


artists learned their trade as apprentices in the workshop of a 
certified master. After a fixed period, an apprentice became a jour¬ 
neyman (or dayworker) who could then hire out his services to 
others but not open his own shop. Journeymen often traveled to 
learn from artists other than their master. Becoming a master 
required completing a “masterpiece” that was evaluated by the 
leaders of the guild. Guilds not only controlled training but 
limited competition from artists outside their towns, investigated 
disputes among members, and saw to the social and economic 
needs of members, such as providing for burials, pensions, and the 
care of widows. Guilds were both economic and social institu¬ 
tions, assuring the quality of their products and seeing to the well¬ 
being of their members. 

One illustrious graduate of the guild system was Rogier van 
der Weyden (1399/1400-1464), a painter who trained with Robert 
Campin in Tournai, and who certainly knew the work of Jan van 
Eyck. By 1435, Rogier had established a flourishing workshop in 
Brussels which took commissions from as far away as Italy and 
Spain. Perhaps his most influential work is the Descent from the 
Cross (fig. 14.15), which dates from about 1435. The crossbow¬ 
mens guild of Louvain (near Brussels) commissioned it as the 
center of an altarpiece for a church there. In this work, Rogier 
depicted the moment when Christs followers lower his body 
from the Cross; the mourners crowd into a shallow box of space. 
Rogier modeled the forms carefully to suggest sculptural pres¬ 
ence, and included enough detail to show every nuance of texture. 

Rogier s goal is to increase the expressive content of his 
pictures. He emphasizes the emotional impact of the scene on its 
participants. Their faces and postures express the grief of the fig¬ 
ures. John the Evangelist on the left and Mary Magdalen on the 
right are bowed in pain. The Virgin s swoon echoes the pose and 
expression of her son. Rogier depicts her intense pain and grief in 
order to inspire the same compassion in a viewer. He has staged 
his scene in a shallow niche or shrine, not against a landscape. This 
bold device focuses a viewer s attention on the foreground and 
allows the artist to mold the figures into a coherent group. 
Furthermore, the emphasis on the body of Christ at the center of 
the composition refers to the celebration of the Eucharist, which 
takes place before the altarpiece during the Mass. Rogier could

find precedents for these grief-stricken gestures and faces in ear¬ 
lier sculpture; these figures share the strong emotion of the 
mourners on the Naumburg choir screen (see fig. 12.57) or the 
Virgin in the Roettgen Pieta (see fig. 12.60). Rogier s memorable 
painting inspired many copies, in both painting and sculpture. 

The heightened emotion with which Rogier imbues his works 
was noted and admired by the Italian diplomat Cyriacus of 
Ancona, who saw another painting by Rogier on this theme in 
1449. (See Primary Source , page 485.) This commentator singled 
out the naturalism in Rogier s work, as he admired the figures 
who seemed to come alive in Rogier s painting. Other Italian 
scholars remarked on Flemish painting s naturalism and piety as 
well. Viewers in Flanders would have brought their own interest 
in meditating on the sacrifice of Christ to their experience of 
Rogier s painting. 

Rogier s depiction of St. Luke Drawing the Virgin , dated 
between 1435 and 1440 (fig. 14.16), reveals his debt to earlier 
Flemish artists. The figure of Mary nursing her son in this image 
shows the continuing influence of Campin, while the composition 
is based on a work by Jan van Eyck. In contrast to the Descent 
from the Cross , here Rogier creates a deep landscape that moves 
into the distance. The figures inhabit a room that opens onto a 


garden protected by fortifications. A man and a woman peer over 
these battlements toward a busy Flemish city in the distance, 
where shopkeepers open for the day and citizens walk the street. 

The painting represents St. Luke the Evangelist in a different 
role, as the portrayer of the Virgin and Christ Child. A Byzantine 
tradition explained that the Madonna appeared miraculously to 
Luke, so that he could take her portrait. This legend helped to 
account for numerous miraculous images of the Madonna in the 
later Middle Ages. Rogier depicts Luke drawing the features of 
the Virgin in silverpoint (a drawing technique using a stylus of 
silver scraped across prepared paper) as she appears before him. 
(Such drawings were the starting point for most paintings of the 
period.) Because of this story, St. Luke became the patron of 
painters’ guilds throughout Europe. Later documents describe a 
painting like this one in the chapel of the Brussels Guild of St. 
Luke. Since this image depicts the making of an image, Rogier s 
painting may be a self-conscious statement about the dignity of 
painting and painters. It was copied numerous times in the fif¬ 
teenth century, even by Rogier s own workshop. In recent years, 
scholars have been studying such paintings with new scientific 
tools that examine the techniques used by the artists. (See The Art 
Historian's Lens , page 488.)

LATE FIFTEENTH-CENTURY ART 
IN THE NETHERLANDS 

The paintings of Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, and Rogier van 
der Weyden offered powerful examples for other artists to follow, 
in the Netherlands and beyond. In the later fifteenth century, 
court patrons continued to prefer objects made of expensive 
materials, particularly gold. They also commissioned illuminated 
manuscripts and tapestries. At the same time, patronage by the 
merchant class continued to grow, and painters found work in 
commissions from the middle classes. Nonetheless, the medium 
of painting gained in prestige as the century wore on, attracting 
interest and patronage in aristocratic circles. Despite the increasing 


market for paintings, large-scale sculpture continued to find a 
market in the fifteenth-century Netherlands, though little has 
survived the ravages of war, social and religious upheavals, and 
changes of taste. Even rarer are survivals of objects made in pre¬ 
cious metals, as the very valuable raw material was easily recycled 
when money was scarce. 

Aristocratic Tastes for Precious Objects, 

Personal Books, and Tapestries 

Aristocratic patrons commissioned small-scale precious objects 
throughout the fifteenth century. One, whose brilliance makes us 
mourn the loss of others, is the Statuette of Charles the Bold , pre¬ 
served in the treasury of the cathedral of Liege in eastern Belgium

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



Scientific and Technical Study of Paintings 


I nvestigative tools used in the contemporary scientific study of mate¬ 
rials are providing new information about the practices of artists in 
the past. The very materiality of works of art makes them appropriate 
for the same sort of study as archaeological discoveries. Chemical 
analysis of paints and pigments is providing information on the 
recipes for making paints that artists used. This information can be 
used to examine workshop practices, to establish authenticity of given 
objects, and to suggest methods of conservation. 

Modern scholars use a variety of techniques to investigate paint¬ 
ings. X-radiographic imaging penetrates painted surfaces and pro¬ 
duces a photographic analysis of the use of lead in the painting 
process. Because lead white was used to lighten pigments, x-radi- 
ographs allow an investigator to examine how an artist modeled forms 
with lighter colors. X-radiographs also reveal details about an artist’s 
brushwork or changes made as the painting progressed. Another tech¬ 
nique uses infrared light, which can see through painted surfaces to 
distinguish dark marks on the white ground of a panel. Aided by spe¬ 


cial infrared cameras (a technique called infrared reflectography), 
analysts can photograph the underdrawings and initial paint layers 
below painted surfaces; computers match these photos to produce 
images of the preparatory layers of the painting. This information is 
invaluable for studying the creative process. It has also aided in deter¬ 
mining which of the many versions of Rogier’s St. Luke Drawing the 
Virgin (see fig. 1 4.1 6) was executed first. 

Because many Renaissance panels are painted on wood, scholars 
have been able to determine the age of a particular panel from the 
number of tree rings in it, using a technique known as dendrochronol¬ 
ogy. The number of tree rings in a panel is then compared to a data¬ 
base of tree rings that have been dated to define the time when the 
tree was probably cut down. This can then provide additional evidence 
for dating the painting. Such evidence has caused some scholars to date 
Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights (see fig. 1 4.22) to around 1 480. 
Similar techniques have revealed the composition of the limestone used 
in Gothic sculpture and the chemical makeup of ancient bronzes.

21 x 12 1 /x 7" (53 x 32 x 17.5 cm). Cathedral treasury, Liege 


(fig. 14.17). Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy commissioned 
the goldsmith Gerard Loyet (before 1442-1500) to make this 
figure; he then gave it to the cathedral in Liege in 1471, perhaps to 
assert his control over that rebellious city. Made of gold and silver 
gilt with enamel details, the 21-inch-high statuette represents 
Duke Charles holding a reliquary; behind him stands St. George, 
Charles s favorite patron saint, who lifts his helmet in greeting. 
The duke is dressed in armor, kneeling on a pillow to make his 
offering. The object demonstrates Loyet s skill and the prestige of 
such objects in the Burgundian court. The composition derives 
from a painting by Jan van Eyck, and so reflects the rising status 
of panel painters as creative innovators. 

The taste of the court also ran to expensive books. Despite the 
introduction of the printing press (see pages 499-502), among the 
traditional elites, the manuscript book—custom-made to cele¬ 
brate the purchasers status and interests—retained its appeal. 
Books of hours, in which prayers were organized into cycles 
according to the hours of the day appealed especially to women. 
A striking example of a complex and lavish illuminated book is the 
Hours of Mary of Burgundy , which includes the coat of arms of 
Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold and last duchess of Burgundy 
evidence that she owned the book before her death in 1482. 

Mary herself may be the woman depicted in figure 14.18. In 
this full-page miniature, the anonymous artist (named after this 
book of hours) depicts an elegantly dressed young woman read¬ 
ing from a book of hours similar to the Hours of Mary of 
Burgundy. Her costume and surroundings indicate her status: 
Golden brocades, transparent veils, jewelry, and flowers surround 
her, and a little dog rests on her lap. She sits in a private chapel, 
whose windows open onto a view of a light-filled Gothic church. 
Through the window the viewer sees the Virgin Mary with her 
child seated in the sanctuary surrounded by angels. To the right

of these sacred figures kneels a group of noble women, whose 
access to the child and his mother may be what the woman in the 
foreground prays for. 

The artist creates a picture within a picture here, as the glimpse 
into the church is completely framed by the architecture of the 
lady’s chapel. Earlier manuscript artists (like the Limbourg 
Brothers) usually put floral or other decorative motifs in the 
border and created a spatial context only for the main image. This 
artist, however, treats the border as a spatial entity in its own right 
that links the border and the main image. The artist takes care to 
record the tactile and sensuous quality of the dogs fur, the trans¬ 
parency of the glass vase, and the reflective qualities of the pearls on 
the ledge. The manuscript page has the impact of a painted panel. 


The court was also the key market for the flourishing industry 
in tapestries. Major workshops practiced in Brussels, Tournai, and 
Arras; the latter citys name became synonymous with the art 
form. Woven with colored threads of wool or silk, tapestries were 
popular with the courtly class or their peers in the Church. The 
tapestry fragment of Penelope Weaving (fig. 14.19), for example, 
was part of a series of “Famous Women” commissioned by the 
bishop of Tournai around 1480. The image depicts the wife of 
Odysseus (or Ulysses) working at a loom. According to Homers 
Odyssey , Penelope fended off her numerous suitors with her 
weaving; she insisted she would not marry again until she had 
completed her work, which she unwove every evening. Although 
a figure from the classical past, Penelope is dressed in the costume

of a fifteenth-century lady. The influence of paintings is apparent 
in the suggestion of space, the detailed treatment of her gems and 
garment, and in the figure. On the wall behind Penelope hangs a 
tapestry within the tapestry in a two-dimensional pattern of 
repeated floral forms called millefleurs , one of the best-selling 
designs for tapestry in the fifteenth century The court of 
Burgundy shared their Italian contemporaries 5 interest in stories 
of the ancients as exemplars for the present, but they envisioned 
them in familiar, not historic terms. The naturalism of the Flemish 
painters provided a language for the tapestry weavers to satisfy 
courtly taste. 


Panel Paintings in the Southern Netherlands 

While the court collected precious objects, illuminated manu¬ 
scripts, and tapestries, the middle-class demand for panel paint¬ 
ings continued to grow. International businessmen invested their 
money and their reputations in commissioning paintings from 
Flemish artists like Fiugo van der Goes (ca. 1440-1482). Fiaving 
served as dean of the painters 5 guild of Ghent, Fiugo entered a 
monastery near Brussels as a lay brother in 1475. Fie continued to 
paint there until his death in 1482. His best-known work is the 
huge altarpiece commissioned around 1474 by an agent of the

Medici bank in Bruges, who shipped it to Florence (fig. 14.20). 
The 10-foot-wide central panel represents the Virgin, St. Joseph, 
and shepherds adoring the newborn Christ Child in Bethlehem. 
In the wings, members of the donor family, including Tommaso 
Portinari, his wife, Maria Maddelena Baroncelli, and their chil¬ 
dren, kneel to face the central image. A spacious landscape unites 
all three wings as a continuous space, with the bare trees and 
December sky suggesting not the Holy Land but Flanders itself. 
Objects in the distance have turned the blue of the atmosphere; 
this use of atmospheric perspective (a technique that recognizes 
the loss of color in distant objects) infuses the panel with a cool 
tonality. Hugo filled this setting with figures and objects rendered 
with precise detail in deeply saturated colors. 

Despite Hugo s realistic renderings of both landscape and fig¬ 
ures, the image contains numerous contradictions for expressive 
effect. Figures vary greatly in scale: The angels and kneeling mem¬ 
bers of the Portinari family are dwarfed by the other figures; the 
patron saints in the wings are the same size as Joseph, the Virgin 
Mary, and the shepherds of the Nativity in the center panel. These 
shifts of scale undermine the pictorial space that the artist has pro¬ 
vided for his figures. Another contrast occurs between the rau¬ 
cous intrusion of the shepherds and the ritual solemnity of all the 
other figures. These fieldhands gaze in breathless wonder at the 
newborn Christ Child, who is the focus of all the figures ranged 
around him. Mary, however, sits at the physical center of the 


composition. Such deliberate contrasts between the pictorial and 
psychological focal points, between the scale of the historical and 
the contemporary figures, and between the static and kinetic pos¬ 
tures of the figures contribute to the unsettling effect of the work. 

The background is populated with narratives that support the 
main theme. Behind the figures in the left-hand panel, Mary and 
Joseph travel toward Bethlehem. Behind the saints on the right, 
the Magi progress toward the center. And in the center, angels 
flicker across the surface, lit by both natural and supernatural 
light. Strategically placed at the front of the picture is a beautiful 
still life of flowers and a sheaf of wheat. As with so many other 
realistic details in Flemish paintings, these have been interpreted 
symbolically. The wheat refers to the bread of the Eucharist and 
the flowers to the Virgin. Portinari brought the triptych to 
Florence in 1483 and installed it in the family chapel attached to 
the hospital of Sant’ Egidio. There it proclaimed the taste, wealth, 
and piety of the donor. Judging from their imitation of it, Italian 
painters who saw the work there especially admired its naturalism 
and its unidealized representation of the shepherds. 

Triptychs were often intended for liturgical spaces. For more 
domestic spaces, patrons wanted smaller objects. For example, the 
young up-and-coming citizen of Bruges Martin van 
Nieuwenhove commissioned a diptych from Hans Memling in 
1487 (fig. 14.21). Born in Germany (ca. 1435-1494), Memling 
worked in Bruges, where his refined style, based on Rogier and

Jan van Eyck, brought him commissions from patrons from all 
over Europe. Italians in Bruges especially preferred his workshop, 
as did local patricians like Van Nieuwenhove. An inscription on 
the frame of his diptych identifies the patron and gives his age, 
while his stylish garment and gilt-edged prayer book express his 
social status. Behind him a piece of stained glass represents his 
patron saint, Martin. The young man focuses his gaze on the left- 
hand panel, where an image of the Virgin and Child appears. 
Martin’s family coat of arms in the window behind them implies 
that the Virgin and Child are visiting him in his own home. The 
reflection in the mirror further expresses this conceit: the artist 
has included the reflections of both the Virgin and young man 
appearing in the same space. Memling has borrowed the concave 
mirror Jan van Eyck used in The “Arnoljini Portrait ” (see fig. 
14.14) to unite the two halves of the diptych. 

Memling s image demonstrates a new trend in portraiture: In 
addition to rendering the features, he creates a believable setting 
for the figure. This contrasts to the inky blackness behind the fig¬ 
ure in Jan van Eyck’s Man in a Red Turban (see fig. 14.13). Access 
to the divine remains a preoccupation for otherwise worldly men; 
in this light-filled room, Martin kneels in permanent prayer, so 
that the image becomes an expression of his devotion. But this 
object also served as a piece of self-promotion, as the many 
personal references to the patron display his self-assurance and 
social status. 


The Northern Netherlands 

The innovations of the early fifteenth-century painters quickly 
spread to the northern Netherlands (present-day Holland), the 
origin of one of the most famous paintings from the era, 
Hieronymus Boschs The Garden of Earthly Delights (fig. 14.22). 
Bosch (ca. 1450-1516) came from a family of painters. He spent 
his life in the town of s Hertogenbosch, the seat of a ducal resi¬ 
dence, from which his name derives. His patrons included the 
duke of Burgundy, whose grandson, King Philip II of Spain, 
owned numerous Bosch paintings in the sixteenth century; it was 
in Philips collection that Fray Jose de Sigiienza encountered 
Boschs painting. (See Primary Source , page 494.) Sigiienza’s 
account has been an important document for interpreting this 
complex and surprising painting, whose subject and meaning have 
been vigorously debated. 

Divided into three panels, The Garden of Earthly Delights rep¬ 
resents humans in the natural world. A continuous landscape 
unites the three sections; the high horizon and atmospheric 
perspective imply a deep vista of the earth from an omniscient 
vantage point. Shades of green create an undulating topography 
marked by thickets of trees and bodies of water. Throughout, 
small creatures both human and nonhuman swarm, while strange 
rock formations and other objects appear at intervals. As Sigiienza 
says, the left-hand wing appears to represent the Garden of Eden,

where the Lord introduces Adam to the newly created Eve. This 
airy landscape is filled with animals, including such exotic crea¬ 
tures as an elephant and a giraffe; it also includes strange hybrid 
monsters. The central panel reveals a world inhabited by tiny 
humans who frolic among giant fruits, birds, and other creatures. 
In the middle ground, men parade around a circular basin on the 
backs of all sorts of beasts. Many of the humans interact with 
huge birds, fruits, flowers, or marine animals. The right-hand 
wing depicts an infernal zone, which may be Hell, where strange 
hybrid creatures torment the tiny humans with punishments 
appropriate to their sins. When the triptych is closed (fig. 14.23), 
its outer wings depict a crystal globe with an image of the earth 
emerging from the waters, with God watching over the events 
from above. An inscription from Psalm 33 says: “For he spoke 
and it came to pass; he commanded it and it stood forth.” Some 
see this image as the third day of creation, others identify it as the 
flood of Noah. 

Despite its triptych format, this is not a traditional altarpiece 
but a secular work. It belonged to Count Henry III of Nassau, in 
whose palace in Brussels it was reported to be in 1517, though 
recent research suggests Bosch could have painted it as early as 
1480. Many scholars place it ca. 1500-1505 and assume that 
Henry of Nassau commissioned it. Scholars have studied many 
different aspects of Bosch’s painting in an effort to find the key to 
its meaning. Some have looked at the numerous visual references 
to verbal puns and proverbs. One theory holds that it represents 


the time of Noah, as shown by the image of a flood on the 
exterior; another that the many swarming nudes express the views 
of a heretical group that promoted free love; yet another that the 
infernal landscape in the right-hand wing demonstrates a moral¬ 
izing condemnation of carnal sin. 

These interpretations suggest that Bosch was a pessimist ser¬ 
monizing about the depravity of humankind. This is certainly the 
way that Jose de Sigiienza described it, although his text also sug¬ 
gests several “allegories or metaphors” embedded in the painting. 
Yet the image itself is beautifully painted and as seductive as the 
sirens in the pool in the middle of the central panel. There is an 
innocence, even a poetic beauty, in this panorama of human activ¬ 
ity that suggests something other than outright condemnation of 
the acts so carefully depicted. This ambivalence has fueled numer¬ 
ous interpretations, including a recent proposal that the image 
depicts an alternative view of history in which the Original Sin of 
Adam and Eve does not happen, and therefore humans continue 
to live in a state of innocence. 

Another interpretation of this painting links it to the practice 
of alchemy as an allegory of redemption. The many strangely 
shaped rocks and fountains refer to the tools and vessels used in 
this medieval science. Bosch married an apothecary’s daughter, so 
his use of the visual symbols of that science has a strong historical 
basis. If we consider its secular function and the interests of his 
educated patron, however, Boschs painting seems to warn its audi¬ 
ence against too much concern for sensual pleasures in the world. 


CHAPTER 1 4 ARTISTIC INNOVATIONS IN FIFTEENTH-CENTURY NORTHERN EUROPE 493 










OURCE 


Fray Jose de Sigiienza 
(15441-1606) 



From The History of the Order of St. Jerome 

The works of Hieronymus Bosch were collected by the Spanish king 
Philip II (r. 1556-1598) and were displayed in his Escorial Palace near 
Madrid , where Sigiienza was the librarian. The interpretation of 
Bosch's work was as difficult then as it is today and caused just as much 
disagreement. This passage is Siguenza’s attempt to interpret the paint¬ 
ing that we call The Garden of Earthly Delights (see fig. 14.22). 

A mong these German and Flemish pictures...there are distributed 
throughout the house many by a certain Geronimo Bosch. Of 
him I want to speak at somewhat greater length for various reasons: 
first, because his great inventiveness merits it; second, because they are 
commonly called the absurdities of Geronimo Bosque by people who 
observe little in what they look at; and third, because I think that these 
people consider them without reason as being tainted by heresy.... 

The difference that, to my mind, exists between the pictures of this 
man and those of all others is that the others try to paint man as he 
appears on the outside, while he alone had the audacity to paint him 
as he is on the inside.... 

The...painting has as its basic theme and subject a flower and the 
fruit of [a] type that we call strawberries.... In order for one to under¬ 
stand his idea, I will expound upon it in the same order in which he 
has organized it. Between two pictures is one large painting, with two 
doors that close over it. In the first of the panels he painted the 
Creation of Man, showing how God put him in paradise, a delightful 
place...and how He commands him as a test of his obedience and 
faith not to eat from the tree, and how later the devil deceived him in 


the form of a serpent. He eats and, trespassing God’s rule, is exiled 
from that wondrous place and deprived of the high dignity for which 
he was created.... This is [shown] with a thousand fantasies and 
observations that serve as warnings.... 

In the large painting that follows he painted the pursuits of man 
after he was exiled from paradise and placed in this world, and he 
shows him searching after the glory that is like hay or straw, like a 
plant without fruit, which one knows will be cast into the oven the 
next day...and thus uncovers the life, the activities, and the thoughts 
of these sons of sin and wrath, who, having forgotten the commands 
of God...strive for and undertake the glory of the flesh.... 

In this painting we find, as if alive and vivid, an infinite number 
of passages from the scriptures that touch upon the evil ways of 
man...many allegories or metaphors that present them in the guise 
of tame, wild, fierce, lazy, sagacious, cruel, and bloodthirsty beasts of 
burden and riding animals.... Here is also demonstrated the transmi¬ 
gration of souls that Pythagoras, Plato, and other poets...displayed in 
the attempt to show us the bad customs, habits, dress, disposition, or 
sinister shades with which the souls of miserable men clothe them¬ 
selves—that through pride they are transformed into lions; by venge¬ 
fulness into tigers; through lust into mules, horses, and pigs; by 
tyranny into fish; by vanity into peacocks; by slyness and craft into 
foxes; by gluttony into apes and wolves; by callousness and evil into 
asses; by stupidity into sheep; because of rashness into goats.... 

One can reap great profit by observing himself thus portrayed true 
to life from the inside....And he would also see in the last panel the 
miserable end and goal of his pains, efforts, and preoccupations, and 
how...the brief joys are transformed into eternal wrath, with no hope 
or grace.

REGIONAL RESPONSES TO 

THE EARLY NETHERLANDISH STYLE 

Artists in many regions of Europe responded to the formal and 
technical achievements of the generation of Robert Campin and 
Jan van Eyck. Local traditions and tastes influenced these regional 
responses, but patrons found the naturalism of the new style 
useful for their religious and social purposes. Many regions of 
Europe, among them France, Spain, and Central Europe, there¬ 
fore produced their own variations on this style. 

France 

The geographic proximity, trade routes, linguistic links, and polit¬ 
ical relationships between the Burgundian Netherlands and 
France helped to spread the innovations in technique and style 
throughout France. Artists either traveled to Flemish cities or 
developed their own brand of naturalism in imitation of the 
effects that Rogier van der Weyden or Hugo van der Goes had 
achieved (see figs. 14.15 and 14.20). Still, French art has its own 


distinctive characteristics. In the first half of the fifteenth century, 
the troubles of the Hundred Years’ War limited expenditure on 
art. Citizens of the war-torn cities commissioned very little, but 
members of the Church and court continued earlier forms of 
patronage. 

After establishing his rule at the close of the Hundred Years’ 
War, King Charles VII of France appointed Jean Fouquet (ca. 
1420-1481) of Tours as his court painter. Both a book illuminator 
and a panel painter, Fouquet traveled to Italy around 1445, where 
he learned some of the innovations of contemporary Italian art 
(see Chapter 15). His work, however, owes much to the 
Netherlandish style in technique, color, and approach. Charles 
VII’s treasurer, Etienne Chevalier, commissioned Fouquet around 
1450 to paint a diptych representing himself and his patron saint, 
Stephen, in proximity to the Virgin and Child, the so-called 
Melun Diptych (figs. 14.24 and 14 . 25 ). Like his Flemish contem¬ 
poraries, Fouquet records the specific physiognomy of the patron 
in his fur-lined garment. The head of the saint, who carries a book 
and a stone (which refers to his martyrdom), seems as individual 
as that of the donor.

They stand in a room with marbled floors and marble panels 
on the walls, framed by antique-inspired pilasters that recede 
to suggest space. The two men gaze across the frame toward 
an image of the enthroned Virgin and Child. According to an 
old tradition, the Madonna is also a portrait: of Agnes Sorel, 
Charles VIIs mistress. If so, the panel presents an image of 
courtly beauty, as befits the Queen of Fieaven, seen wearing a 
crown amid a choir of angels. Fouquet deliberately contrasts the 
earthly and divine realms. The deep space in the left panel differs 
strikingly from that on the right, organized as a rising triangle, 
with the cool colors of the Virgin and Child set against the vivid 
reds and blues of the angels. In contrast to his Flemish counter¬ 
parts, Fouquet is not interested in suggesting specific textures, 
and he subordinates details to the overall design. Fie does not 
appeal to the emotions. His images are geometrically ordered and 
rational rather than expressive. 

Spain 

Netherlandish naturalism reverberated strongly on the Iberian 
peninsula in the fifteenth century. Artists traveled between 
Flanders and Spain, and trade, diplomacy, and a dynastic marriage 
brought the united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon into increas¬ 
ingly close contact with Flanders. These contacts were echoed in 


the works of art imported into Spain from Flanders and in works 
of art produced in Spain by local artists. 

A powerful example of the Spanish interpretation of Flemish 
naturalism is the Pieta painted in 1490 by Bartolome Bermejo (ca. 
1440-1500) for a deacon of the cathedral of Barcelona (fig. 14 . 26 ). 
Bermejo was born in Cordoba, but he worked in many regions of 
Spain, and may have been trained in Bruges. His Pieta sets the 
image of the Virgin grieving for her dead son in a dark and atmos¬ 
pheric landscape dominated by an empty cross. Instead of the 
historical mourners called for by the narrative, and included by 
Giotto in his fresco in Padua (see fig. 13.20), Mary and Christ are 
flanked by St. Jerome to a viewer s left (the lion is his attribute) 
and a portrait of the deacon to the right. This removes the theme 
from a strict narrative context and makes the painting function as 
an image of devotion similar to the Roettgen Pieta (see fig. 12.60), 
though the precise detail of the figures and the landscape derive 
from Flemish models. In contrast to the cool rationality of 
Fouquet, Bermejo s work is highly emotional and expressive. 

Central Europe 

Linked by trade and political ties to the Netherlands, artists and 
patrons in Central Europe were also receptive to the new style, 
especially in cities along the Rhine (see map 14.1). One such artist,

Conrad Witz (1400/10-1445/46) became a citizen of Basel, 
Switzerland, and a master in the citys guild of painters at just the 
moment that the Church’s Council of Basel concluded. This 
council, or synod, had met from 1431 to 1434 to debate whether 
the pope alone or councils of bishops had the right to determine 
doctrine. These controversial issues inform the paintings Witz 
made in 1444 for the bishop of Geneva, which were destined for 
the cathedral of St. Peter. 

The panels represent scenes from the life of St. Peter, The 
Miraculous Draught of Fishes (fig. 14.27) depicts Christ calling 
St. Peter to walk across the Sea of Galilee to join him. The solidly 


modeled figure of Christ dominates the right-hand side of the 
composition, in part because his red garment contrasts vividly 
with the green tones of the painting. St. Peter appears twice, once 
in the boat among other apostles, who are called to be “fishers of 
men,” and again sinking into the waters upon which Christ seems 
to float. The technique and style owe much to the Flemings, but 
Witz devotes his attention to the landscape. In place of the Sea of 
Galilee, Witz substitutes Lake Geneva, emphasizing local topog¬ 
raphy, such as the distinctive mountain above Christ’s head. He 
accurately depicts every reflection on the water, so that we can see 
the bottom of the lake in the foreground and a variety of textures

on the water s surface in the background. Witz places the events 
of the historical past in the setting of the present. Peter s sinking 
into the water, suggesting his need for assistance, may be evidence 
of the bishop s support for the council s role in advising the pope. 

AN ALT ARPIECE IN ITS ORIGINAL SETTING Witzs 
panels were originally the wings of an altarpiece, many of which 
had sculptures as their central element, or corpus. In German¬ 
speaking regions, altarpieces were usually made of wood, often 
large and intricately carved. Protestant reformers in the sixteenth 
century destroyed many sculpted religious images, so surviving 


examples are relatively rare. The St. Wolfgang Altarpiece (fig. 
14 . 28 ) by the Tyrolean sculptor and painter Michael Pacher 
(ca. 1435-1498) is impressive both because of its scale and because 
it remains in its original setting. 

The surviving contract between the abbot who commissioned 
it and the painter specifies both the subject matter and the quality 
of the materials and workmanship. (See Primary Source , page 
499.) This was the normal pattern for contracts given to artists for 
expensive projects in the period. 

Much as Jan van Eyck did in the Ghent Altarpiece , Pacher cre¬ 
ates a vision of Heaven: The corpus depicts the coronation of the

From the Contract far the 
St. Wolfgang Altar piece 

It took Michael Pacher 11 years (1471-81) to complete this elaborate 
altar piece far the pilgrimage church of St. Wolfgang. The altar piece is 
still in its original location. 

H ere is recorded the pact and contract concerning the altar at 
St. Wolfgang, concluded between the very Reverend, Reverend 
Benedict, Abbot of Mondsee and of his monastery there, and Master 
Michael, painter of Bruneck, on St. Lucys day of the year 1471. 

ITEM, it is first to be recorded that the altar shall be made conform¬ 
ing to the elevation and design which the painter has brought to us at 
Mondsee, and to its exact measurements. 

ITEM, the predella shrine shall be guilded on the inside and it shall 
show Mary seated with the Christ Child, Joseph, and the Three Kings 
with their gifts; and if these should not completely fill the predella 
shrine he shall make more figures or armored men, all gilt. 

ITEM, the main shrine shall show the Coronation of Mary with 
angels and gilt drapery—the most precious and the best he can make. 


ITEM, on one side St. Wolfgang with mitre, crozier, church, and 
hatchet; on the other St. Benedict with cap, crozier, and a tumbler, 
entirely gilded and silvered where needed. 

ITEM, to the sides of the altar shall stand St. Florian and St. George, 
fine armored men, silvered and gilded where needed. 

ITEM, the inner wings of the altar shall be provided with good 
paintings, the panels gilded and equipped with gables and pinnacles, 
representing four subjects, one each.... 

ITEM, the outer wings—when the altar is closed—shall be done 
with good pigments and with gold added to the colors; the subject 
from the life of St. Wolfgang.... 

ITEM, at St. Wolfgang, while he completes and sets up the altar, we 
shall provide his meals and drink, and also the iron work necessary for 
setting up the altar, as well as help with loading wherever necessary. 

ITEM, the contract is made for the sum of one thousand two hun¬ 
dred Hungarian guilders or ducats.... 

ITEM, if the altar is either not worth this sum or of higher value, and 
there should be some difference of opinion between us, both parties 
shall appoint equal numbers of experts to decide the matter.

Virgin as Queen of Heaven flanked by the patron saints of the 
monastery. Carved of soft wood that permits the sculptor to cre¬ 
ate deep folds and sharp edges, the lavishly gilt and colored forms 
make a dazzling spectacle as they emerge from the shadows under 
Flamboyant Gothic canopies. The figures and setting in the cen¬ 
tral panel seem to melt into a pattern of twisting lines that permits 
only the heads to stand out as separate elements. 

The complexity and surface ornamentation that dominate the 
corpus contrast with the paintings of scenes from the life of the 
Virgin on the interior of the wings. Here, the artist represents 
large figures, strongly modeled by clear light, and he suggests a 
deep space for them. He takes a viewers vantage point into 
account, so that the upper panels are represented as if seen from 
below. This kind of perspective must have been inspired by 
developments in contemporary Italian painting. Pacher almost 
certainly crossed the Alps and visited northern Italy, where some 
of his works were commissioned and where he had learned to use 
the Italians’ new technique for projecting space. (Compare his 
perspective to Mantegna’s in fig. 15.49.) This type of perspective 
appears only in the wings, however, where scenes from the histor¬ 
ical past are set into spaces that look like the Austrian present. 
The interior of the temple where the circumcision takes place, for 
example, has a vault much like ones in Late Gothic churches. 
Pacher makes the historical scenes in the wings much more down 
to earth than the spectacle of Heaven in the center.

PRINTING AND THE GRAPHIC ARTS 

Along with the new techniques of painting, fifteenth-century 
Europe saw the development of a new medium: printmaking. The 
invention of movable type and the printed page would have 
enormous consequences for Western civilization. Tradition has 
credited Johann Gutenberg (ca. 1397-1468) with inventing mov¬ 
able type, but the roots of printing actually lie in the ancient Near 
East 5,000 years ago. The Sumerians were the earliest “printers,” 
for their relief impressions on clay, from stone seals, were carved 
with both pictures and inscriptions (fig. 2.10). From Mesopotamia 
the use of seals spread to India and eventually to China. The 
Chinese applied ink to their seals in order to impress them on 
wood or silk, and in the second century CE they invented paper. 
By the ninth century they were printing pictures and books from 
wooden blocks carved in relief, and 200 years later, they devel¬ 
oped movable type. Some of the products of Chinese printing 
may have reached the medieval West—perhaps through Islamic 
intermediaries. 

The technique for manufacturing paper came to Europe from 
contact with Islamic regions, though it gained ground as a cheap 
alternative to parchment only very slowly. While printing on 
wood blocks was known in the late Middle Ages, it was used 
solely for ornamental patterns on cloth. All the more astonishing, 
then, is the sudden development, over the course of a mere 
century, of a printing technology capable of producing editions of 
several hundred copies of relatively inexpensive books. The new 
technology spread quickly across Europe, spawning the new 
industry of bookmaking. Printed books were far less expensive 
than handmade volumes, but they were useless to those who

could not read. Literacy began to rise among the lower classes, a 
consequence that would have a profound effect on Western civi¬ 
lization. To compete with illuminated manuscripts, printed books 
included printed images, which were often handcolored to imitate 
the more expensive manuscripts. Ultimately, the printed book 
almost completely replaced the illuminated manuscript. 

The pictorial and literary aspects of printing were closely 
linked from the start. The practice of inking pictorial designs 
carved on wooden blocks and then printing those designs on 
paper began in Europe late in the fourteenth century. Early 
surviving examples of such prints, called woodcuts, come from 
France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Painters or sculptors 
probably furnished the designs, but specialists did the actual 
carving of the wood blocks. (For the various techniques of print¬ 
ing, for pictures as well as books, see Materials and Techniques , 
page 501.) 

An early dated example of a woodcut is the Buxheim St. 
Christopher (fig. 14.29), so called because it came from a 
monastery in that south German town. This single sheet, hand- 
colored woodcut bears the date 1423 and a prayer to the saint; 


woodcuts combining image and text like this on a single block 
were sometimes assembled into popular picture books called 
block books. Simple, heavy lines define the forms in the print, 
including the fall of the garment around the figures and the 
contours of objects. Thinner lines in parallel rows—called 
hatching—denote shadows or textures of objects, but the 
composition is strictly two-dimensional, as the landscape forms 
rise along the picture plane to surround the figures. According to 
legend, Christopher, patron saint of travelers, was a giant who 
ferried people across a river; he was surprised one day by the 
weight of a child, who turned out to be Christ. 

The forms in the Buxheim St. Christopher owe a great deal to 
Late Gothic style, but the audience for prints were not the aristo¬ 
crats of the Middle Ages. Fifteenth-century woodcuts were 
popular art. A single wood block yielded thousands of copies, to 
be sold for pennies apiece, so that for the first time in history 
almost anyone could own pictures. A detail from a Flemish 
Annunciation panel of about 1435 in figure 14.30 reveals one use 
to which people put such prints: A print much like the Buxheim 
St. Christopher is pinned on a wall in a middle-class household. 


500 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 























Printmaking 

P rintmaking is a technique for making multiple copies of the same 
image. In the fifteenth century, most prints used dark black ink on 
paper (though some are printed on parchment). Printmakers used one 
of several techniques to make these images; the two broad categories 
are relief prints (in which the lines to be printed are raised from the 
block) and intaglio (in which the lines to be printed are cut into a 
plate). Designs (and text) will print as reversed images as they are 
transferred to the paper by the force of a press. By 1 500, printing tech¬ 
nology allowed for the reproduction of pictures by several methods, all 
developed at the same time as the printing of type. 

Woodcut 

In a woodcut, the design is cut into a wood block so that raised ridges 
will print. The thinner the ridges are, the more difficult they are to 
carve, so specialists took over this phase of the work. Early woodcuts 
often include inscriptions, but to carve lines of text backward in relief 
on a wooden block must have been risky—a single slip could ruin an 
entire page. It is little wonder, then, that printers soon had the idea of 
putting each letter on its own small block. Wooden movable type 
carved by hand worked well for large letters but not for small ones, 
and the technique proved cumbersome for printing long texts such as 
the Bible. By 1 450, this problem had been solved through the intro¬ 
duction of metal type cast from molds, and the stage was set for book 
production as it was practiced until the late twentieth century. Because 
the text was carved in relief, it became apparent that accompanying 
pictures should be carved in relief as well, so that an entire page could 
be printed with one run of the press over the matrix— or form—which 
held all the information to be printed. 


Engraving 

The technique of engraving—embellishing metal surfaces with incised 
pictures—had developed in classical antiquity (see fig. 6.20) and 
continued to be practiced throughout the Middle Ages (see fig. 11.7). 
Goldsmiths and designers of armor, in particular, were experts in 
incising designs on metal surfaces. These skills allowed goldsmiths to 
engrave a plate that could serve as the matrix for a paper print. 
Because the lines themselves were incised into the plate, more linear 
information could be included in the design. In an engraving, lines are 
V-shaped grooves cut with a special tool, called a burin, into a metal 
plate—usually copper, which is relatively soft and easy to work with. 
Ink is forced into the grooves made by the burin, the plate is wiped 
clean of excess ink, and a damp sheet of paper is placed on top of the 
inked plate; the force of a press transfers the ink—and the design—to 
the paper. 




From the start, engravings (images taken from incised plates) 
appealed to a smaller and more sophisticated public. The oldest 
surviving examples, from about 1430, already show the influence 
of Flemish painters. Early engravers were usually trained as gold¬ 
smiths, but their prints reflect local painting styles. Their forms 
are systematically modeled with fine hatched lines and are often 
convincingly foreshortened. Distinctive styles appear even in the 
earliest engravings, and engravers often included initials and dates 
in their prints. Consequently, many engravers of the late fifteenth 
century are known to us by name. 


Printing Centers in Colmar and Basel 

Martin Schongauer of Colmar, then in Germany (ca. 1435/50 
-1491) learned the goldsmiths craft from his father, but he 
became a printmaker and a painter. He studied the paintings of 
Rogier van der Weyden, which probably influenced the style of

his engravings. Their complex designs, spatial depth, and rich 
textures make them competitors to panel paintings. Some artists 
found inspiration in them for large-scale pictures. They were also 
copied by other printmakers. The Temptation of St. Anthony (fig. 
14 . 31 ) is one of Schongauer s most famous works—known and 
admired in sixteenth-century Italy. The print represents the cli¬ 
max of St. Anthony’s resistance to the Devil. Unable to tempt him 
to sin, the Devil sent demons to torment him. Varying the type of 
mark he made on the plate, Schongauer displays a wide range of 
tonal values and a rhythmic quality of line, and he approximates a 
wide range of textures—spiky, scaly, leathery, furry—to enhance 
the expressive impact of the image. 

Since the time of Conrad Witz, the Swiss city of Basel had 
embraced the new technology for printing books to become a major 
center for publishing. There, a group of reform-minded intellec¬ 
tuals and authors contributed texts for publication, which graphic 
artists illustrated with woodcuts. One of the best sellers of the 
period was a satirical text by Sebastian Brant called the Ship of 
Fools , published in Basel in 1494. Brant s text poked fun at many 
of the ills he perceived in his society, which, as the title implies, he 
characterized as a boat piloted by Folly. One important theme his 



1 4.32 Scholar in Study , woodcut from Sebastian Brant’s Ship of Fools 
(Basel, 1494) 


text addresses is contemporary dissatisfaction with the Church. 
This tide of anticlerical feeling was already rising when Luther s 
critique of the Church was posted in 1517 in Wittenberg (see page 
634). But Brant s satirical eye also fell on his own peers, as the 
woodcut in figure 14.32 reveals. The image depicts a scholar in his 
study surrounded by books, but rather than read them, he holds 
a duster to clean them. The mans costume, including a hood with 
bells on it, identifies him as a fool. Compared with the Buxheim 
St. Christopher , the unnamed artist who produced this woodcut 
increases the density of hatching that implies texture and volume 
and attempts a spatial context for the forms. The practice of 
coloring prints fell by the wayside as the medium developed its 
own aesthetic and appeal. 

As a period of cultural flowering and great innovation, from 
the complex naturalistic imagery in the paintings of Campin and 
Jan van Eyck to the dynamism of the new technology of printing, 
we could consider the fifteenth century in northern Europe a 
renaissance. That term is usually linked to this century, but not to 
this region: Another version of naturalistic representation was 
developing at the same time in Italy, to which we shall turn in the 
next chapter.

The Early Renaissance in 
Fifteenth-Century Italy 


un 


N either a scholar writing a history of France in thirteenth- 

century Paris nor a notary writing a contract in fourteenth-century 
Bruges could have imagined that he was living in a “middle” age; he only 
knew that his age followed the eras of the past. But intellectuals in 
fifteenth-century Italy thought of themselves as living in a new age, one that was 


distinct from the immediate past. This consciousness of historical 
difference separates the thinkers of the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries from their medieval forebears. These thinkers devalued 
the post-Roman, or medieval world, and believed they could 
improve their culture by reviving the best features of antiquity, 
that is, Roman and Greek culture. Their efforts, beginning in the 
fifteenth century in Italy, sparked a cultural flowering of great 
significance for the history of Europe. 

First called the rinascimento , Italian for “rebirth,” the period 
came to be known by its French name, the Renaissance. Its origi¬ 
nal users defined it as the rebirth of classical learning, literature, 
and art. Modern historians have divided the Italian Renaissance 
into stages: an early phase in the fifteenth century, the High 
Renaissance denoting a period of exceptional achievement, and 
the Late Renaissance, which is primarily a chronological term. 
Neither the definition of the Renaissance as the revival of 
classical forms nor the chronological limits apply easily outside 
of Italy, but the broader definition of a Renaissance as a cultural 
or artistic renewal has come to apply elsewhere. In northern 
Europe, as we have seen in Chapter 14, scholars and artists did 
not have the same dedication to reviving the ancients, though 
they did study the past. More significant was an economic and

cultural expansion that resulted in far-reaching technical and 
cultural achievements. 

The causes of the cultural flowering in Italy are complex, as 
events, people, ideas, and social shifts came together in a revolu¬ 
tion that produced many of the characteristics of modern 
European civilization. For this reason, some scholars refer to this 
era as the “early modern period. ” This cultural shift was funda¬ 
mentally an intellectual one. The followers of the fourteenth-cen¬ 
tury author Petrarch began to study texts from Greece and Rome 
both for their moral content and their style. They committed 
themselves to the studia humanitatis —the study of human works, 
emphasizing rhetoric, literature, history, and moral philosophy. 
The roots of humanist education lay in the medieval university, 
which prized theology, but in the Renaissance humanism aimed to 
create knowledge for practical use in the world—for lawyers, 
bureaucrats, politicians, diplomats, and merchants. 

Humanist scrutiny of ancient texts not only deepened knowl¬ 
edge of Latin authors, but also stimulated the study of the great 
Greek thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato, Euclid, and Ptolemy. 
Humanists’ analytical approach and empirical observations 
inspired new thinking in many fields, including mathematics 
and natural science. Studying history taught the importance of 
individuals acting in the world to assure their personal fame, yet 
also encouraged educated people to serve the common good by 
participating in civic life. Humanist educational ideas spread 
quickly throughout Italy, aided by the introduction into Italy of

CHAPTER 





Map 1 5.1 Political units of the Italian Peninsula in the fifteenth century 


the printing press in 1464, which made books more widely avail¬ 
able. Governing parties throughout Italy, whether princes, popes, 
or elected councils, used humanists in their bureaucracies and 
courts to conduct their business. 

Humanist ideas affected artists as well as the patrons who 
hired them. As humanists studied ancient texts, artists studied 
ancient artworks, not just to imitate details or motifs, but to 
understand the principles by which ancient buildings were 
designed and ancient sculptures achieved their naturalism. 
Renaissance artists took up the ancient ideal of rivaling nature in 
their art and brought their practical skills to this intellectual aim. 
They devised techniques such as perspective and mastered new 
technologies like oil painting and printmaking to further their 
goal of reproducing the natural world and to spread their ideas. 

Artists employed these ideas and techniques to make art that 
served spiritual and dynastic functions for their patrons. Medieval 


institutions—religious orders, guilds, and the Church—commis¬ 
sioned church buildings, architectural sculpture, wall paintings, 
altar furnishings, and other objects as they had in earlier centuries, 
though secular patronage increased. The artists earned personal 
glory along the way so that by the end of the century the status 
of the artist had changed. Through much of the Middle Ages, the 
social and economic position of artists in society was comparable 
to that of any other artisan. They were respected for the skill of 
their hands, but not considered intellectuals. Many artists in 
fifteenth-century Italy behaved like intellectuals, investigating the 
past and solving problems scientifically so the status of the artist 
rose as a result. 

During this period, there was still no single political entity 
called Italy Regions of different size and political organization 
competed with each other economically and often on the battle¬ 
field (map 15.1). The Kingdom of Naples in the south was a

In Praise of the City of 
Florence (ca. 1403-4) by 
Leonardo Bruni 


Though horn in Arezzo, Leonardo Bruni (1370-1444) moved to 
Florence to take up law and humanistic studies. His mentor, Coluccio 
Salutati, was the chancellor of Florence, to which post Bruni succeeded 
in 1406. An ardent student of classical literature, he modeled his own 
writings on those of Greek and Roman authors. He wrote this panegyric 
to Florence afrer the death ofGiangaleazzo Visconti, which ended the 
threat to the city from Milan. 

T herefore, what ornament does this city lack? What category of 
endeavor is not fully worthy of praises and grandeur? What 
about the quality of the forebears? Why are they not the descendants 
of the Roman people? What about glory? Florence has done and 


daily continues to do great deeds of honor and virtue both at home 
and abroad. What about the splendor of the architecture, the 
buildings, the cleanliness, the wealth, the great population, the 
healthfulness and pleasantness of the site? What more can a city 
desire? Nothing at all. What, therefore, should we say now? What 
remains to be done? Nothing other than to venerate God on 
account of His great beneficence and to offer our prayers to God. 
Therefore, our Almighty and Everlasting God, in whose churches 
and at whose altars your Florentines worship most devoutly; and 
you, Most Holy Mother, to whom this city has erected a great temple 
of fine and glimmering marble, where you are at once mother and 
purest virgin tending your most sweet son; and you, John the Baptist, 
whom this city has adopted as its patron saint—all of you, defend this 
most beautiful and distinguished city from every adversity and from 
every evil.

monarchy. Dukes, princes, and despots carved up northern Italy 
into city-states, including Milan, Mantua, and Urbino. The pope 
returned to Rome from Avignon to reclaim control of the Papal 
States which had been lost when the papacy moved to France in 
1305. And the major trading cities of Venice and Florence formed 
republics, where mercantile elites controlled political power. 
Though the cultural flowering we call the Renaissance occurred 
throughout Italy, for many modern scholars the city of Florence 
was its birthplace. 

FLORENCE IN 

THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY 

One reason for the prominence of Florence in histories of the 
Renaissance is that many early humanists were Florentines 
who patriotically praised their hometown. Florence was an 
important manufacturing center, a key center for trade, and a 
major center for international banking, whose wealth and social 
dynamism attracted talented individuals. Instead of hereditary 
aristocrats, bankers and merchants controlled the government. 
Groups of merchants and artisans banded together in guilds 
(economic and social organizations) to strengthen their positions. 
The governing council, called the Signoria, consisted of officials 
elected from members of the guilds and prominent mercantile 
families. The government was a republic, a word that for 
Florentines signaled their identity as the heirs of the ancient 
Roman Republic. 

Florentine politicians, such as Coluccio Salutati and Leonardo 
Bruni, successive chancellors to the Signoria, gave eloquent voice 
to Florentine aspirations. Urging the city to defy the duke of 
Milan as he threatened to invade in 1401 -02, Salutati called on the 
city s Roman history as a model to follow. After this threat had 
passed, Leonardo Bruni declared that Florence had been able to 


defy Milan because of her republican institutions, her cultural 
achievements, and the origins of her people. In his In Praise of the 
City of Florence (1403-04), he compared Florences virtues to 
those of fifth-century BCE Athens, which had defied the invading 
Persians. Yet he also praised Florentine piety and devotion, 
expressed in the building of churches. (See Primary Source , 
above.) Renaissance humanists wished to reconcile the lessons of 
antiquity with their Christian faith. 

Bruni s words may explain why practical Florentines invested 
so much of their wealth in cultural activity. The Signoria and 
subsidiary groups commissioned numerous public projects to 
beautify and improve their city (map 15.2, page 517). It was not 
only individuals and families who sponsored public projects, so 
too did merchant guilds, which held competitions among artists 
for their commissions. The successful accomplishment of projects 
of great visibility enhanced the prestige of sponsoring individuals 
and groups and drew artists to the city. Many native sons (daugh¬ 
ters were forbidden entry to most guilds, so few women became 
artists) became sculptors, painters, and goldsmiths. In this climate 
of humanism, innovation, and display, the Renaissance in 
Florence opens with a competition. 

The Baptistery Competition 

Andrea Pisano s bronze doors for the baptistery (see fig. 13.13), 
completed in 1360, were an impressive example of Florentine 
taste and piety. Their success inspired the overseers of the 
works at the baptistery, the Guild of Wool Merchants, to open 
another competition for a second set of bronze doors. They asked 
each entrant to make a design on the theme of the Sacrifice of 
Isaac, while retaining the Gothic quatrefoil shape from Andrea 
Pisano s first doors for the baptistery (see fig. 13.14). Competing 
artistsall had to include the same figures and were given the same 
materials. Seven artists made trial reliefs for this competition,

though only two of them survive. One is by Filippo Brunelleschi 
(1377-1446) (fig. 15 . 1 ); the other is by Lorenzo Ghiberti 
(1381-1455), whom the guild ultimately chose to execute the 
second doors of the baptistery (fig. 15 . 2 ). Ghiberti left a 
description of the competition and his acclaim as the victor 
in his Commentaries , written late in his life. (See Trimary Source , 
page 509.) 

The subject the artists were assigned, from the book of 
Genesis, recounts how God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his 
only son; obediently, Abraham led Isaac to an altar on a mountain 
and lifted his knife to slaughter him when an angel halted the sac¬ 
rifice. Although Isaac is a figure for Christ in Christian theology, 
this is also the story of a chosen people avoiding doom through 
divine intervention, an issue about which Florentines felt strongly 
in 1402. For the artists, the challenge was to fill the four lobes of 
the quatrefoil, yet at the same time to convey the narrative suc¬ 
cinctly and naturalistically. In his trial relief, Brunelleschi organ¬ 
ized the forms to focus on the dynamic figure of Abraham whose 
arm, lifted to strike Isaac, is grasped by the angel rushing in from 
the left. Isaac struggles as his father grabs his neck, contorting his 
posture and increasing the drama. The ram who replaces him as 
the sacrifice stands next to the altar. Subsidiary figures of shep¬ 
herds and a donkey fill the lower portions of the quatrefoil; 


though their postures are complex (one of them based on an 
ancient work of art), they do not contribute much to the main 
theme. Brunelleschi gives his figures great naturalism, and the 
composition great drama. 

Ghiberti s relief reveals the strength of his composition, his 
skill at rendering the human form, and his observation of natural 
details. Ghiberti solved the problem of the quatrefoil field by 
placing narrative details in the margins and the focal point at the 
center. Thus, the ram on the mountain appears in the upper left 
and the foreshortened angel on the right. At the center, Abraham 
gestures dramatically as he moves to sacrifice his son, bound and 
naked on an altar. Isaac twists to face the spectator, his beautifully 
formed torso contrasting with the drapery worn by his father. Fie 
does not struggle, but seems heroically to accept his fate. A wedge 
of mountain keeps other figures away from the main scene. 
Ghibertis design successfully combines movement, focus, and 
narrative. At the same time, his interest in the lyrical patterning of 
the International Gothic tempers the brutality of the scene. 
Abraham s drapery falls in cascades similar to those of the figure 
of Moses in Sluters The Well of Moses (see fig. 14.1). In addition 
to the design, Ghiberti s entry demonstrated a technical finesse 
that may have persuaded the judges to select him: Unlike 
Brunelleschi, he cast his entry in one piece.

Lorenzo Ghiberti 
(ca. 1381-1455) 

The Commentaries, from Book 2 

Ghiberti's incomplete Commentaries is an important early document of 
art history. The first hook consists largely of extracts from Pliny and 
Vitruvius; the second is about art in Italy in the thirteenth and four¬ 
teenth centuries and ends with an account of Ghiberti's own work (see 

fig- 15 -v- 

W hereas all gifts of fortune are given and as easily taken back, 
but disciplines attached to the mind never fail, but remain 
fixed to the very end ... I give greatest and infinite thanks to my par¬ 
ents, who ... were careful to teach me the art, and the one that cannot 
be tried without the discipline of letters. ... Whereas therefore 
through parents’ care and the learning of rules I have gone far in the 
subject of letters or learning in philology, and love the writing of 
commentaries. I have furnished my mind with these possessions, of 
which the final fruit is this, not to need any property or riches, and 
most of all to desire nothing. ... I have tried to inquire how nature 
proceeds ... and how I can get near her, how things seen reach the eye 
and how the power of vision works, and how visual ... works, and 
how visual things move, and how the theory of sculpture and paint¬ 
ing ought to be pursued. 

In my youth, in the year of Our Lord 1400,1 left Florence because 
of both the bad air and the bad state of the country. ... My mind 


was largely directed to painting. ... Nevertheless ... I was written 
to by my friends how the board of the temple of St. John the Baptist 
was sending for well-versed masters, of whom they wanted to see 
a test piece. A great many very well qualified masters came through 
all the lands of Italy to put themselves to this test. ... Each one was 
given four bronze plates. As the demonstration, the board of the 
temple wanted each one to make a scene ... [of] the sacrifice of Isaac. 
... These tests were to be carried out in a year. ... The competitors 
were ...: Filippo di ser Brunellesco, Simone da Colle, Niccolo 
D’Arezzo, Jacopo della Quercia from Siena, Francesco da 
Valdambrino, Nicolo Lamberti. ... The palm of victory was conceded 
to me by all the expects and by all those who took the test with me. 
The glory was conceded to me universally, without exception. 
Everyone felt I had gone beyond the others in that time, without a 
single exception, with a great consultation and examination by 
learned men. 

... The judges were thirty-four, counting those of the city and the 
surrounding areas: the endorsement in my favor of the victory was 
given by all, and the by the consuls and board and the whole body of 
the merchants guild, which has the temple of St. John the Baptist in 
its charge. It was ... determined that I should do this bronze door for 
this temple, and I executed it with great diligence. And this is the first 
work; with the frame around it, it added up to about twenty-two 
thousand florins.

The casting of the doors kept Ghiberti’s workshop busy for 20 
years. Many of the most sought-after artists of the next generation 
spent time there, as he completed the doors. The competition 
between these two artists sets the stage for developments in both 
architecture and sculpture in Florence during the first half of the 
fifteenth century. 

Architecture and Antiquity in Florence 

Although he may have lost the competition for the baptistery 
doors, Filippo Brunelleschi is a crucial figure for Renaissance art, 
especially in architecture. While he continued to work in sculp¬ 
ture, his study of ancient buildings drew him to solving architec¬ 
tural problems. After losing the competition for the doors, 
Brunelleschi went to Rome with his friend the sculptor 
Donatello. There he studied ancient structures and reportedly 
took exact measurements of them. His discovery of linear per¬ 
spective (discussed later in this chapter) may well have grown 
out of his search for an accurate way of recording the appearance 
of those ancient buildings. He brought his study of ancient 
buildings to the service of design problems at the Florentine 
Duomo, at other churches and chapels in Florence, and other 
structures. Other architects working in Florence took inspiration 
from his example, among them Leon Battista Alberti. His 


treatises on both painting and architecture helped to spread 
Brunelleschi’s innovations. 

BRUNELLESCHI AND THE DOME OF FLORENCE 
CATHEDRAL Between 1417 and 1419, Brunelleschi again com¬ 
peted with Ghiberti, this time for the job of building the dome for 
Florence cathedral (fig. 15 . 3 ). The dome had been planned half a 
century earlier, so at this stage only details could be changed, and 
its vast size posed a problem of construction. Brunelleschi’s pro¬ 
posals were the fruit of his study of Gothic, Roman, Byzantine, 
and maybe even Persian buildings, but the building of the dome 
was as much a feat of engineering as of style. (See Materials and 
Techniques , page 512.) The project occupied him for most of 
the rest of his life, and it would come to symbolize Florentine 
inventiveness, piety, ambition, and skill. 

Soaring hundreds of feet above street level, the dome dwarfs 
all other structures in Florence. Resting visually on the smaller 
semidomes that surround the cathedral’s eastern end, the ribs of 
the dome rise upward dramatically, terminating in a marble 
cupola or lantern. Brunelleschi designed this lantern to tie the 
eight exterior ribs together, but it also marks the crescendo of 
that upward movement. When the cathedral was dedicated on 
March 25, 1436, the city rejoiced. Florence had demonstrated its 
devotion to the Virgin Mary, as well as its ambition to overawe

its neighbors culturally. Florentines were justifiably proud that a 
native son had so cleverly accomplished what previous genera¬ 
tions had failed to do. Brunelleschis forms would influence 
architecture far beyond Tuscany. 

BRUNELLESCHI’S OSPEDALE DECLI INNOCENTI The 

work at the Duomo came under the purview of the wool mer¬ 
chants ’ guild, but another guild in Florence sponsored a different 
sort of public project for the city, intended to address a social 
problem. The Guild of Silk Manufacturers and Goldsmiths hired 
Brunelleschi to design a hospital for abandoned children near the 
church of the Santissima Annunziata. In 1421, construction began 
on the Ospedale degli Innocenti (Fiospital of the Innocents), 
although building continued long after Brunelleschi s death. The 
facade of the hospital (fig. 15.4) consists of a covered walkway, or 
loggia, defined by an arcade raised slightly above ground level. A 
strong horizontal molding sits above the arcade, and above that is 
a simple arrangement of pedimented windows. 


In designing this hospital, Brunelleschi revived the architec¬ 
tural forms of the ancients, as seen in the columns, their capitals, 
the arches, and the entablatures. Doing so demanded that he work 
within rigid rules. Unlike a medieval column (see, for example, 
the colonnettes in the nave of San Francesco in Assisi, fig. 13.1), a 
Classical column is strictly defined; its details and proportions can 
vary only within narrow limits. Unlike any other arch (horseshoe, 
pointed, and so forth), the Classical round arch has only one pos¬ 
sible shape: a semicircle. The Classical architrave, profiles, and 
ornaments must all follow similarly strict rules. This is not to say 
that Classical forms are completely inflexible. But the discipline 
of the Greek orders, which can be felt even in the most original 
Roman buildings, demands regularity and discourages arbitrary 
departures from the norm. Using such “standardized” forms, 
Brunelleschi designed the facade of this hospital as a series of 
blocks of space of the same size, defined by the bays of the arcade. 
Each bay establishes a square of space that is covered by a dome 
resting on pendentives (fig. 15.5). Transverse arches divide the

domes inside the arcade. Using contrasting colors of stone, 
Brunelleschi emphasizes the edges of these units of space without 
disrupting their rhythmic sequence. 

One other principle accounts for the balanced nature of the 
design. For Brunelleschi, the secret of good architecture lay in 
choosing the “right” proportions—that is, proportional ratios 



15.5 View under arcade of Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence 


expressed in simple whole numbers—for all the major measure¬ 
ments of a building. For example, the entablature over the columns 
sits at twice the height of a column for a ratio of 2:1. The ancients 
had possessed this secret, he believed, and he tried to discover it 
when he measured their monuments. What he found, and exactly 
how he applied it, is uncertain, but his knowledge may have been 
passed to Leon Battista Alberti. In his Treatise on Architecture , 
Alberti argues that the mathematical ratios that determine musical 
harmony must also govern architecture, for they recur through¬ 
out the universe and thus are divine in origin. (See Primary Source , 
page 514.) Similar ideas, derived from the theories of the Greek 
philosopher Pythagoras, had been current during the Middle 
Ages, but they had never before been expressed so directly and 
simply. At the Innocenti, Brunelleschi used ratios to dictate rela¬ 
tionships: The windows are centered between the columns, the 
intervals between columns equal the height of the columns, the 
span between the columns is the distance from the column to 
the wall. Proportion locks the composition into a balanced whole. 
The arcade, with its beautifully proportioned columns supporting 
arches, made of a dark local sandstone called pietra serena (liter¬ 
ally, “peaceful stone”), gives the facade a graceful rhythm. 

Above the spandrels of the arches, terra-cotta reliefs in later 
roundels from the della Robbia workshop depict babies, the 
“innocents” for whom the structure was named. Brunelleschis 
Innocenti not only served Florence s poor, it defined a public 
square. This loggia establishes one side of a piazza perpendicular 
to the church of the Santissima Annunziata; later, the facades 
of other buildings formed the remaining limits of the square. 
Such public spaces were used for social, religious, and political 
functions, and by echoing the design of the Roman Forum, 
they expressed the Florentine sense of themselves as the heirs 
to Rome. 


CHAPTER 1 5 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IN FIFTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 51 1 
















































MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Brunelleschi's Dome 


A s the basic dimensions and plans for the cathedral of Florence had 
been established in the fourteenth century, Brunelleschi first 
determined to lift the dome on a drum above the level of the nave. He 
proposed to build the dome in two separate shells, which was a 
method more common in Islamic than Italian architecture, especially in 
Persia. Compare the fourteenth-century tomb of the ll-Khan Oljeytu in 
Sultaniya (see fig. 9.20). These two shells were supported by a series 
of ribs, eight of them visible on the exterior but others hidden; the ver¬ 
tical ribs were themselves linked by rows of horizontal ribs, a system 
which may have been inspired by the coffered dome of the Pantheon 
(see fig. 7.25). Both the use of ribs and the pointed profile reflect 
Gothic practice. The dual shells of the dome lighten the whole mass 
since their walls are thin relative to their size. Brunelleschi’s herring¬ 
bone-pattern brickwork serves both to resist cracks caused by settling 
and to lessen the weight as the courses of brick get thinner as they rise. 

Along with these design features, Brunelleschi proposed innova¬ 
tions in the construction process. The traditional practice had been to 
construct a wooden centering across the span of the dome to support 
it during construction, but this required huge pieces of timber. To 
avoid this, Brunelleschi designed a new system by which temporary 
scaffolding was cantilevered out from the walls of the drum, thereby 
reducing the size and amount of timber needed during building. And 



Model of some of the structural features of Brunelleschi’s dome 


instead of having building materials carried up on ramps to the 
required level, he designed new hoisting machines. Brunelleschi’s 
entire scheme reflects a bold, analytical mind that was willing to 
discard conventional solutions if better ones could be devised. 


In the revival of classical forms, Renaissance architecture 
found a standard vocabulary. The theory of harmonious propor¬ 
tions gave it a syntax that had been mostly absent from medieval 
architecture. Similarly, the revival of classical forms and propor¬ 
tions enabled Brunelleschi to transform the architectural “vernac¬ 
ular” of his region into a stable, precise, and coherent system. 
Brunelleschi s achievement placed architecture on a firm footing 
and applied the lessons of classical antiquity for modern Christian 
ends. Furthermore, his study of the ancients and his practical 
application of classical geometric proportions probably stimu¬ 
lated his discovery of a system for rendering forms in three 
dimensions. This technique became known as linear or scientific 
perspective. (See Materials and Techniques , page 516.) 

BRUNELLESCHI AT SAN LORENZO Brunelleschis skills 
also brought him to the notice of private patrons. Early in the fif¬ 
teenth century, the up-and-coming Medici family began a project 
to rebuild their parish church. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de’ 
Medici commissioned Brunelleschi to add a sacristy to the 
Romanesque church of San Lorenzo. The sacristy serves two 
purposes; it provides a liturgical space in which the priest prepares 
himself for the ritual of the Mass, but Giovanni also intended it as 
a funerary chapel. Because a later generation of Medici commis¬ 
sioned a sacristy on the opposite side of the church, Brunelleschi s 
chapel, completed by 1429, became known as the Old Sacristy. 

The chapel (fig. 15.6) consists of a square room oriented 
toward a niche with an altar. Brunelleschi covered this rectilinear

space with a dome resting on triangular pendentives, uniting the 
circular form of a dome with a square. In plan, the square 
inscribes the circle. These two forms were thought ideal by 
ancient architects like Vitruvius, and thus by Brunelleschi and 
contemporary humanists. Proportion is also important here; 
Brunelleschi uses a 2:1 measure to determine the height of the 
architrave as well as further subdivisions of wall and space (such 
as the height of the doors that flank the altar). Fie marked these 
divisions, and in fact all the points where walls and other struc¬ 
tural elements meet, with stone moldings that contrast with the 
wall. The result is a room that seems at once light and stable, 
spacious and harmonious, and that melds Christian function with 
forms inspired by antiquity. 

The family was so pleased with his plans for this sacristy that 
they asked Brunelleschi to develop a new design for the entire 
church. Brunelleschis work began in the 1420s, but construction 
proceeded in fits and starts; the nave was not completed until 
1469, more than 20 years after the architects death. (The exterior 
remains unfinished to this day.) Nevertheless, the building in its 
present form is essentially what Brunelleschi had envisioned 
about 1420, and it represents the first full statement of his archi¬ 
tectural aims (figs. 15.7 and 15.8). 



15.8 Plan of church of San Lorenzo 


If the sacristy offered a new and exciting solution to issues of 
space and structure, the plan of the church itself seems at first 
glance to be more conventional. The plan shows it to be a basilica 
form, with nave and aisles; it terminates in a square east end and

OURCE 


Leon Battista Alberti on what 
makes a building beautiful 



From the Ten Books on Architecture (1452) 

Alberti composed his treatise on architecture afier studying the treatise 
hy the Roman architect Vitruvius. Originally written in Latin , his 
treatise prescribes the best way to design and build buildings and was 
intended for both practicing architects and for their patrons. This 
passage argues that the key to good building is something Alberti called 
concinnitus , which means something like consonance or harmony. 

W hen you make judgments on beauty, you do not follow mere 
fancy, but the workings of a reasoning faculty that is inborn in 
the mind...Within the form and figure of a building there resides 
some natural excellence and perfection that excites the mind and is 
immediately recognized by it. I myself believe that form, dignity, 
grace and other such qualities depend on it, and as soon as anything 


is removed or altered these qualities are themselves weakened and 
perish ... 

From this we may conclude ... that the three principal components 
of that whole theory into which we inquire are number, what we 
might call outline, and position. But arising from the composition and 
connection of these three is a further quality in which beauty shines 
full face: our term for this is concinnitas , which we say is nourished 
with every grace and splendor. It is the task and aim of concinnitas to 
compose parts that are quite separate from each other by their nature, 
according to some precise rule, so that they correspond to one another 
in appearance. That is why when the mind is reached by way of sight 
or sound, or any other means, concinnitas is instantly recognized ... 

Let us conclude as follows. Beauty is a form of sympathy and 
consonance of the parts within a body, according to definite number, 
outline and position, as dictated by concinnitas , the absolute and 
fundamental rule in nature. This is the main object of the art of build¬ 
ing, and the source of her dignity, charm, authority and worth.

Leach and Robert Tavernor (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1 988) 


limits ornament as in some Cistercian churches (see fig. 11.21). 
San Lorenzos unvaulted nave and transept recall Franciscan 
churches like Santa Croce (see fig. 13.4). Brunelleschi was con¬ 
strained by the just completed sacristy and the preexisting church. 
But a new emphasis on symmetry and regularity distinguishes his 
design for San Lorenzo, accompanied by architectural elements 
inspired by the past and organized by attention to proportion. 
The ground plan demonstrates Brunelleschi’s technique of com¬ 
posing with units of space in regular square blocks, so that each 
bay of the nave is twice as wide as its side aisles, and the crossing 
and choir are each four times the size of each bay of the aisle. 

Inside, static order has replaced the flowing spatial movement 
of Gothic church interiors, such as Chartres (see fig. 12.12). From 
the portal, a viewer can clearly see the entire structure, almost as 
if looking at a demonstration of scientific perspective. The effect 
recalls the “old-fashioned” Tuscan Romanesque, as seen at Pisa 
cathedral (see fig. 11.34), as well as Early Christian basilicas like 
Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome (see fig. 8.16). To Brunelleschi, 
these monuments exemplified the church architecture of antiq¬ 
uity. They inspired his use of round arches and columns, rather 
than piers, in the nave arcade. Yet these earlier buildings lack the 
lightness and clarity of San Lorenzo; their columns are larger and 
more closely spaced, so that they tend to screen off the aisles from 
the nave. Only the blind arcade on the exterior of the Florentine 
baptistery is as graceful in its proportions as San Lorenzo’s, but it 
has no supporting function (see fig. 11.35). Since the Baptistery 
was thought to have once been a classical temple, it was an appro¬ 
priate source of inspiration for Brunelleschi and for the new 
generation of Medici patrons. 

Brunelleschis innovations in construction techniques, in 
designing spaces, and in using the architectural vocabulary of 
antiquity made his work very influential. Some of the next gener¬ 
ation of architects, such as Michelozzo (see page 533) trained with 


him. He was also a friend and correspondent of Leon Battista 
Alberti (1404-1472), a Florentine humanist, scholar and author; 
his treatise On Painting {which is dedicated to Brunelleschi, refers 
to “our dear friend” Donatello, and praises Masaccio), completed 
ca. 1435, helped to spread Brunelleschis formula for perspective 
and the author’s own ideas about what good painting required. 
During a stay at the court of Ferrara in 1438, Alberti was asked to 
restore Vitruvius’ treatise on architecture, then known in various 
manuscripts. Upon his return to Rome five years later, he began 
a systematic study of the monuments of ancient Rome that led 
to the Ten Books on Architecture (finished 1452 and published 
1485)—the first book of its kind since Vitruvius’ treatise, on 
which it is modeled. (See Primary Source , above.) Alberti’s ideas 
about architecture had roots in his study of the past, but 
his emphasis and prescriptions for proportion owe something 
to Brunelleschi, too. Alberti’s writings helped to spread Floren¬ 
tine innovations through Italy and increased the prestige of 
Florentine artists as well. It brought him important commissions 
as an architect. 

ALBERTI AT SANTA MARIA NOVELLA Few of 

Brunelleschi’s buildings were completed in his lifetime, so we do 
not know what he would have done with their facades. In fact, 
few of the major churches of Florence had their facades com¬ 
pleted in the Renaissance. (Neither Santa Croce nor the Duomo 
had complete facades until the nineteenth century; San Lorenzo 
still has no facade.) One important church in Florence that did 
have its facade completed, however, is Santa Maria Novella. The 
exterior of this Dominican church, built largely between 1278 and 
1350, had been left unfinished above the row of polychromed 
Gothic niches with their Gothic portals. 

Repairing and improving a church was an act of piety—

wealthy Giovanni Rucellai, to have this facade completed around 
1458 (fig. 15.9). Rucellai paid Leon Battista Alberti to design and 
install a marble facade. Multicolored marble facades were tradi¬ 
tional in Tuscany. Alberti s models for this project included the 
cathedral (see fig. 15.3) and other churches in Florence, including 
the baptistery (see fig. 11.35) and San Miniato al Monte (see fig. 
11.36), from which the emphatic arcades may derive. 

Other than the doorways and giant round oculus, which were 
fixed, Alberti s facade masks its relationship to the rest of the 
church. As he chose not to let the internal structure of the church 
(with its nave higher than the side aisles) limit him, the architect 
could use a system of squares to design the facade. Three main 
squares divide the facade. Two on the lower story flank the 
extraordinarily classicizing main portal; likewise, the “temple” 
atop the frieze fits within a square. Mathematical ratios lock these 
squares into relationships with the whole facade and with the 
other elements of the composition. Albertis use of graceful 
scrolls to bridge the gap between the temple and the frieze was 
truly innovative and was to prove extremely influential (see fig. 
17.23). It also helps to disguise the loose fit of the facade with the 


main body of the church by hiding the clerestory. Just below the 
pediment on the frieze level of the “temple,” Alberti includes an 
inscription that credits Giovanni Rucellai for bringing the work 
to completion. It is the patron, not the artist, who gains the glory 
for the work. 

Alberti built other influential buildings outside Florence (see 
page 546). Fie and Brunelleschi laid the foundations for 
later architects to design buildings based on their principles of 
emulating antiquity and designing with an eye to harmonious 
proportions. 

Ancient Inspirations in Florentine Sculpture 

While work continued on the baptistery doors and the dome of 
Florence cathedral, another competition played out nearby at Or 
San Michele. Begun in 1337, this structure served both as a gran¬ 
ary and a shrine holding a locally venerated image of the Virgin 
and Child. The guilds of Florence oversaw the building, with each 
one taking responsibility for filling a niche on the exterior with 
sculpture. In 1406, the city set a deadline to complete the work

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Perspective 


O ne of the genuinely transformative inventions of the Renaissance 
was linear, or scientific, perspective, sometimes called one-point 
or center-point perspective. The system is a geometric procedure for 
projecting the illusion of space onto a two-dimensional surface. Its 
central feature is the vanishing point, a single point toward which 
any set of parallel lines will seem to converge. If these lines are per¬ 
pendicular to the picture plane, their vanishing point will be on the 
horizon. (Such lines are called orthogonals.) To further clarify the 
space, lines parallel to the picture plane, called transversals (not 
shown), are laid in at regular intervals, derived geometrically. 

Brunelleschi is said to have developed this tool, but artists had been 
experimenting since antiquity with techniques to create the illusion of 
depth on a flat surface. At Pompeii, wall painters sometimes used 
color to suggest deep space (see fig. 7.55), a technique known as 
atmospheric or aerial perspective. This method recognizes the eye’s 
inability to perceive color at great distances, and that specific colors 
become light blue or gray at the horizon line. In addition, the forms 
themselves often become less clear. (See the lower section of fig. 
1 4.1 0.) Artists also adjusted spatial elements according to how the 
forms looked to them, sometimes with excellent results, as in Van 
Eyck’s The “Arnolfini Portrait”(see fig. 1 4.1 4). 


within ten years. In the decades that followed, the guilds and the 
sculptors they commissioned competed intensely to create 
impressive statues of their patron saints. The major guilds com¬ 
missioned Lorenzo Ghiberti to execute several statues for Or San 
Michele, while some younger sculptors won commissions from 
less powerful guilds. 


In Early Renaissance Italy, scientific perspective systemized the pro¬ 
jection of space using mathematics and geometry, overturning the 
intuitive perspective practices of the past. This “scientific” approach to 
making images (whether paintings, prints, drawings, or reliefs) 
became an argument for upgrading the fine arts to become one of the 
liberal arts. In 1 435, Brunelleschi’s discovery was described in On 
Painting by Leon Battista Alberti, the first Renaissance treatise on 
painting. It remains a standard element of drawing instruction to 
this day. 

One advantage of this technique is that the artist can adjust the per- 
spectival system to take account of the presence of a spectator. The 
method presupposes that a beholder’s eye occupies a fixed point in 
space, so that a perspective picture dictates where the viewer must 
stand to see it properly. Thus the artist who knows in advance that the 
image will be seen from above or below, rather than at ordinary eye 
level, can make the perspective construction correspond to these 
conditions. (See, for example, fig. 1 5.55.) Sometimes, however, these 
vantage points are so abnormal (as when a viewer is looking up at an 
image on the ceiling) that the design must be foreshortened to an 
extreme degree. In such cases, the artist may create an “ideal 
beholder” for the image, regardless of a spectator’s actual viewpoint. 


NANNI DI BANCO The Guild of Wood and Stone Carvers hired 
one of its members, Nanni di Banco (ca. 1380-1421), to fill its niche 
at Or San Michele with an image of the Four Crowned Saints, 
called the Quattro Coronati (fig. 15 . 10 ). Carved between 1409 
and 1416/17, these figures represent four Christian sculptors 
who were executed for refusing to carve a pagan statue ordered by

the Roman emperor Diocletian. The life-size saints stand in a 
Gothic niche as if discussing their impending fate. Their bodies 
seem to spill out of the confines of the niche, draped as they are 
in the heavy folds of their togas. These garments and the heads of 
the second and third of the Coronati directly recall Roman por¬ 
trait sculpture of the first century CE (see fig. 7.35). It is as if 
Nanni were situating the martyrs in their historical moment. His 


figures emulate Roman verism and monumentality. The relief 
below the saints represents a sculptor, stonecutters, and a mason at 
work, both explaining the story of the martyrs and advertising 
the skills of the patrons who commissioned the work. This double 
function occurs often in the statues designed for the niches on 
Or San Michele, reflecting the buildings double origin in 
commerce and piety.

DONATELLO AT OR SAN MICHELE One of Ghibertis for¬

statues for Or San Michele. The linen weavers’ guild turned to 
him to fill its niche with a figure probably completed in 1413 (fig. 
15.11). Their patron, St. Mark, stands almost 8 feet high, but that 
is only one of the features that makes him so imposing. His large,

powerful hands grip a book (his Gospel). His body stands in a 
pose Donatello learned from studying the art of the ancients: One 
leg is flexed while the other holds the body’s weight in a contrap- 
posto stance (see fig. 5.33). St. Mark’s drapery falls in deep folds 
to reveal and emphasize his posture. 


Donatello treats the human body as an articulated structure, 
capable of movement, and its drapery as a separate element that is 
based on the shapes underneath rather than on patterns and 
shapes imposed from outside. Following classical precedents such 
as the Doryphoros , Donatello carefully balances the composition, 
so the elements on the left (as a viewer sees it) stress the vertical 
and the static, while those on the right emphasize the diagonal and 
kinetic. St. Mark’s deeply carved eyes and undulating beard give 
him a powerful personality, while the mass of drapery reminds the 
viewer of the linen weavers’ products. This work reflects 
Donatello’s deep understanding of the principles that guided the 
artists of antiquity and his commitment to them. St. Mark reveals 
what Donatello learned from studying ancient works of sculp¬ 
ture: an emphasis on naturalistic form, the independence of body 
and drapery, a balanced but contrasting composition, the poten¬ 
tial for movement, and psychological presence. 

Donatello finished his St. George (fig. 15.12) for the Guild of 
Armorers around 1417. The niche is so shallow that the figure 
seems poised to step out of it. Although dressed in armor, he 
appears able to move his limbs easily. His stance, with the weight 
placed on the forward leg, suggests he is ready for combat. 
Originally, he held a real sword or lance in his right hand, and he 
wore a real helmet, effectively showcasing the guild’s wares. The 
controlled energy of his body is reflected in his eyes, which seem 
to scan the horizon for the enemy. St. George is portrayed as a 
Christian soldier, spiritually akin to the St. Theodore at Chartres 
(see fig. 12.22) and to other figures of chivalry. 

Below the niche a relief panel shows the hero’s best-known 
exploit, the slaying of a dragon. The woman on the right is the 
princess whom he had come to free. Fiere, Donatello devised a 
new kind of shallow relief (called schiacciato, meaning “flat- 
tened-out”), yet he created an illusion of almost infinite depth. In 
this relief, the landscape behind the figures consists of delicate 
surface modulations that catch light from varying angles. Every 
tiny ripple has a descriptive power that is greater than its real 
depth. The sculptor’s chisel, like a painter’s brush, becomes a tool 
for creating shades of light and dark. The energetic figure of the 
saint on horseback, battling the dragon in the foreground, 
protrudes from this atmospheric background, while the princess 
watches. The whole work becomes an image of watchfulness and 
preparedness for danger. 

DONATELLO AT WORK IN SIENA, PADUA, AND 
FLORENCE Donatello’s innovations in Florence soon became 
known elsewhere in Italy, leading to commissions in other cities, 
such as Siena and Padua. His career was long and productive mak¬ 
ing him the most influential sculptor of fifteenth-century Italy. It 
is worth pausing here to consider the range of his activities from 
the 1420s until the 1460s, as there is such variety, invention and 
power in his art. 

Donatello’s early career may have begun in Ghiberti’s work¬ 
shop, but he ultimately competed with his mentor both at Or San 
Michele and in Siena. In 1416, Lorenzo Ghiberti was one of a 
group of artists hired to execute a new baptismal font for that

citys baptistery, San Giovanni. Donatello took over one of the 
relief panels for the sides of the hexagonal basin in 1423. He fin¬ 
ished The Feast ofFFerod (fig. 15.13) by 1427. The relief represents 
the story of John the Baptist’s martyrdom; Salome, the step¬ 
daughter of King Herod, requested the head of the saint as a 
reward for performing a dance. Donatello combines many stages 
in the narrative into one space. The focus of the drama—the exe¬ 
cutioner presenting the head of St. John the Baptist to Herod—is 
far to the left, while the dancing Salome and most of the specta¬ 
tors are massed on the right. Yet the center is empty. Donatello 
created this gaping hole to add to the impact of the shocking sight, 
bolstered by the witnesses’ gestures and expressions. Moreover, 
the centrifugal movement of the figures suggests that the picture 
space does not end within the panel but continues in every direc¬ 
tion. The frame thus becomes a window through which is seen a 
segment of deepening space. The arched openings within the 
panel frame additional segments of the same reality, luring the 
viewer farther into the space. 

This architecture, with its round arches and fluted columns 
and pilasters, reflects the designs of Donatello’s friend and col¬ 
league Filippo Brunelleschi. More importantly, The Feast of 
Fierod is an example of a picture space using Brunelleschi’s linear

perspective. A series of arches set at different depths provides the 
setting for different figures and moments in the biblical story: In 
the background, we see the servant carrying the head of the 
Baptist, which he then presents to Herod in the foreground. 
Donatello used perspective to organize the action as a continuous 
narrative, unfolding through space as well as time. 

Donatello s successes in Tuscany led to a commission from the 
Republic of Venice in 1443. The commander of the Venetian 
armies, Erasmo da Narni (nicknamed “Gattamelata”), had 
recently died, and Venice sought to honor him with a statue. To 
this end, Donatello produced his largest free-standing work in 
bronze: the Equestrian Monument of Gattamelata (fig. 15.14), 
which still stands in its original position on a tall pedestal near the 
church of St. Anthony in Padua. Having visited Rome, Donatello 
certainly knew the tradition of equestrian statues exemplified by 
that of Marcus Aurelius (see fig. 7.33). The work also reflects the 
medieval tradition seen in the monument to Bernabo Visconti in 
Milan (fig. 13.33). Like the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius , 
the Gattamelata is impressive in scale and creates a sense of bal¬ 
ance and dignity. The horse, a heavy-set animal fit to carry a man 
in full armor, is so large that the rider must dominate it by force 
of personality rather than by size. Like the Visconti work, it 
belongs to a tradition of representations of military leaders on 
horseback as funerary monuments. In his vivid portrait of a gen¬ 
eral, Donatello reenergizes this tradition by the carefully realistic 
depiction of the armor and fittings, and his powerful characteri¬ 
zation of Gattamelata s features. 

Despite these “foreign” commissions, Donatello spent most of 
his career in Llorence, where he produced works for the Duomo, 
the Palazzo della Signoria and for important families like the 
Medici. Lor the latter s palace, he apparently executed a bronze 
David (see fig. 15.33), which will be discussed below. In addition 
to projects in bronze, Donatello worked in less expensive medi¬ 
ums. Although the circumstances of its commission are unclear, 
Donatello carved a powerful Mary Magdalen sometime in mid¬ 
century. Rather than marble or bronze, this life-size figure (fig. 
15.15) was carved in poplar wood, then painted and gilded. Our 
earliest reference to this object dates from around 1500 and 
describes it as being displayed in the baptistery, although there has 
been much speculation about its origins and date. Late medieval 
enhancements of Mary of Magdala s biography reported that she 
spent the last years of her life in the desert as a hermit in peni¬ 
tence. In his image of her, Donatello carves the soft wood into 
complex textures to render her rough garment and her hair, and to 
give her figure a gaunt, emaciated look. Her limbs and face are 
painted the ruddy color of someone who lives in the desert, while 
her hair was originally gilded. The artist is less interested in 
ancient forms here than he is in expressive naturalism. 

Even though the date for this figure is uncertain, many schol¬ 
ars see the Magdalen as a work of Donatello s old age, and thus in 
its spiritual intensity they see a change of mood for the artist. In 
any case, the Magdalen demonstrates Donatellos range as a 
sculptor, as he explores the expressive possibilities of another 
sculpted medium. He worked in wood, marble, bronze, and terra

cotta, leaving a prodigious amount of sculpture behind when he 
died in 1466. 

GHIBERTI AND LATER FLORENTINE SCULPTURE 

Donatellos contemporary Lorenzo Ghibertis work on the 
bronze doors for the baptistery continued, with the assistance of 
numerous other artists, until their completion in 1424. This set of 
doors so impressed the Guild of Wool Merchants, which oversaw 
the building, that it commissioned him to execute a second pair. 
These doors, begun in 1425 but not completed until 1452, were 
ultimately installed in the east entry of the baptistery, facing the

cathedral; this area is called the Paradise, so the doors were termed 
the Gates of Paradise (fig. 15.16), a witticism that reportedly orig¬ 
inated with Michelangelo. Where the earlier doors by Andrea 
Pisano and Ghiberti each bore 28 small panels in quatrefoils, these 
two doors each contain five large panels in simple square frames, 
creating a larger field for each image. These panels depict scenes 
from the Hebrew Bible, completing the program of all three 
doors: One door is devoted to the life of John the Baptist, one to 
the life of Christ, and one to the Hebrew Bible. Two humanists 
may have planned the program for the later doors: Ambrogio 
Traversari (1386-1439) and the chancellor, Leonardo Bruni. The 
latter prescribed that the doors should be both significant and 
splendid. To achieve splendor, Ghiberti completely gilded the 
masterfully crafted bronze reliefs and framed the panels with fig¬ 
ures of prophets in niches, portrait heads in roundels, and foliate 
decorations. Significance was achieved through the selection of 
themes and the legibility of the narratives. 

In designing these reliefs, Ghiberti drew on the new devices 
for pictorial imagery he and his rivals had pioneered, including 
the schiacciato relief devised by Donatello for the St. George at Or 
San Michele and the linear perspective developed by Brunelleschi. 
The graceful proportions, elegant stances, and fluid drapery of the 
figures bespeak Ghiberti s allegiance to the International Gothic 
style. The hint of depth seen in The Sacrifice of Isaac (see fig. 15.2) 
has grown in The Story of Jacob and Esau (fig. 15.17) into a deeper 
space defined by the arches of a building planned to accommodate 
the figures as they appear and reappear throughout the structure 
in a continuous narrative. The relief tells the story of Isaac mistak¬ 
enly blessing his younger son, Jacob, instead of the elder, Esau. 


The blind Isaac sends Esau off to hunt on the left, but confers his 
blessing on the disguised Jacob on the right. Isaac s effective pref¬ 
erence to the younger Jacob over the older Esau foreshadowed 
Christianity replacing Judaism for medieval theologians. 
Ghiberti s spacious hall is a fine example of Early Renaissance 
architectural design. 

A HUMANIST’S TOMB Tomb sculpture was another important 
form in fifteenth-century Florence. On the death of its illustrious 
chancellor Leonardo Bruni, the city of Florence honored him with 
a monument installed in Santa Croce (fig. 15.18). This humanist 
and statesman had played a vital part in the city’s affairs since the

beginning of the century; when he died in 1444, he received a 
grand funeral “in the manner of the ancients.” Bernardo Rossellino 
(1409-1464), a sculptor from the countryside around Florence, 
executed the tomb. Since Bruni had been born in Arezzo, his 
native town probably contributed to the project and perhaps 
favored Rossellino, another former resident, for the commission. 

Bruni s contributions to the city as politician, historian, and 
literary figure forged Florentines’ notion of themselves as the 
heirs to Roman culture, so Rossellino s design paid homage to this 
theme. His effigy lies on a bier supported by Roman eagles, his 
head wreathed in laurel and his right hand resting on a book (per¬ 
haps his own History of Florence). On the sarcophagus, two fig¬ 
ures with wings hold an eloquent inscription. The only religious 
element appears in the lunette, where the Madonna and Child 
look down at the effigy from a roundel. Above the arch, a heraldic 
lion appears in a wreath supported by angels. This symbol of 
Florence associates Bruni with the city he served and links 
Florence to his goal of reviving Roman virtues. 

LATER SCULPTURE AT OR SAN MICHELE Although 
many of the guilds had filled their niches by 1430, more sculptural 
commissions were given at Or San Michele in the second half of 
the century. Not all groups active in commissioning works of art 
could afford the expense of bronze or marble; some guilds 
installed terra-cotta roundels in the facade above the niches. The 
leading sculptor in this medium was Luca della Robbia 
(1400-1482), a student of Nanni di Banco, who executed a medal¬ 
lion of the Virgin and Child for the Guild of Doctors and 
Apothecaries around 1465 (fig. 15.19). Luca covered the earth- 
colored clay with enamel-like glazes to mask the surface and

Child beneath a Brunelleschian arch, flanked by lilies. The blue 
background highlights the flowers and the architectural forms. 
Mother and child form a compact group, their heads echoing each 
other, as they look downward to make eye contact with a viewer 
passing by. Such inexpensive substitutes for marble and bronze 
carvings attracted many customers and the della Robbia work¬ 
shop became a factory, turning out scores of small Madonna 
reliefs still visible throughout Florence.

Patronage Studies 


S eeing a work of art in a museum, a modern viewer may not be 
aware of its original function or context, nor of the circumstances 
that brought it into creation. Many art historians find that an impor¬ 
tant way to investigate these circumstances is to focus on the patron¬ 
age of art. Such studies may include finding evidence in documents 
indicating who paid the artist for the work; considering what role the 
patron may have had in determining style or subject matter; evaluat¬ 
ing the relationship between the artist and the patron; and drawing 
conclusions about what the patron wanted the work of art to do. 

Relationships between patron and artist in the Renaissance varied 
greatly. In princely courts, an artist could be considered a member of 
the household staff, with many rather mundane tasks to do, or an 
esteemed member of the prince’s circle, with special status and pres¬ 
tige. In urban centers, artists may have interacted with patrons on a 
more socially equal level, but the person buying the work of art still 


had a great deal to say about the finished product. In gifts made to 
churches, patrons might want their portraits painted into the work of 
art or their coat of arms prominently displayed to remind a viewer of 
the identity of the donor, a practice that was widespread by the end of 
the Middle Ages. The system of patronage in Italy was part of a larger 
social network. In Florence, the great families of a neighborhood were 
often the major patrons of large projects for the entire neighborhood 
(for example, the Medici at San Lorenzo and the Rucellai at Santa Maria 
Novella). Other families or groups often allied themselves with the 
great families for political, social, or commercial reasons. In some 
cases, this resulted in works of art that represented or made reference 
to the great families. Artists favored by the major patrons could gain 
other clients among the followers of those patrons. The investigation 
of these issues has enhanced our understanding of the way works of 
art functioned in their time.

Later interventions at Or San Michele brought other changes. 
Sometime after 1462, a sculpture by Donatello was removed and 
its niche reassigned to the judges of the merchants ’ guild. This 
group, responsible for adjudicating commercial cases, hired 
Andrea del Verrocchio (1435-1488) to fill the niche with an image 
reflecting their activities, using a theme traditionally associated 
with justice. The architecture of the niche remained as Donatello 
had designed it, so Verrocchio executed the figures of The 
Incredulity of Thomas (fig. 15.20) without backs to squeeze them 
into the shallow space. The bronze figures stand close together, as 
the apostle Thomas seeks proof of the miracle of the Resurrection 
by probing the wound in Christ’s side. Verrocchio was a painter 
as well as a sculptor, and this sculpture shares with contemporary 
paintings an interest in textures, the play of light and dark in mas¬ 
sive drapery folds, and illusionism. The niche can barely contain 
the oversized figures, so Thomass foot projects beyond the limits 
of the frame, linking passersby to the scene. His body twists into 
the composition, leading a viewer to the gentle features of Christ. 
The eloquent poses and bold exchange of gestures between Christ 
and Thomas convey the drama of the scene. Verrocchio lets the 
active drapery, with its deep folds, suggest the calm of Christ and 
the disturbance in Thomas’s mind. Michelangelo admired the The 
Incredulity ofThomas for the beauty of the figures; and Leonardo 
da Vinci learned directly from Verrocchio, as his teacher, to create 
figures whose actions express the passions of the mind. 

Sculpture in Florence took many forms, though it was often 
commissioned in association with buildings. Doors, niches, bap¬ 
tismal fonts, and altars were all adorned with sculpture in relief or 
with figural works of a scale and impressiveness that almost 
brings them to life. Materials ranged from less expensive terra 
cotta to gilded bronze. Renaissance sculptors’ study of the 
ancients and interest in naturalism inspired their increasingly 
realistic and psychologically charged imagery. 


Painting in Florentine Churches and Chapels 

Well-funded guilds oversaw the sculptural adornment of public 
buildings like the baptistery and Or San Michele, and great 
families often sponsored building programs in churches. Many of 
the elite families of Florence, having patronage rights in chapels, 
commissioned paintings rather than sculpture. (See The Art 
Historian's Lens , above.) The stimulus of such fresco and panel 
commissions led to many innovations in the art of painting. The 
achievements of the sculptors in realizing vivid sacred characters 
on the niches of Or San Michele and the tools for projecting 
space provided by Brunelleschi inspired new directions in 
Renaissance painting. 

GENTILE DA FABRIANO Patrons commissioned chapels in 
mendicant and parish churches, such as the Gothic church of Santa 
Trinita. Here the sacristry was endowed by the Strozzi, one of the 
wealthiest families in Florence. To complete the program, Palla 
Strozzi hired Gentile da Fabriano to paint the altarpiece, The 
Adoration of the Magi , which Gentile signed and dated in 1423 
(fig. 15.21). Gentile (ca. 1385-1427) worked throughout northern 
Italy in a style informed by the International Gothic. The lavish, 
triple-arched gilt frame of the altarpiece, with a predella (the base

central panel: the visit of the Magi to Bethlehem to acknowledge 
the newborn Jesus as king. A cavalcade of richly dressed courtiers, 
as well as horses, dogs, and exotic animals (monkeys, leopards, and 
camels), fills the front plane of the picture as the three kings 
advance to venerate the child, who sits in his mother’s lap to the 
left. Behind the stable and rock formations that define the frontal 
plane, the landscape winds upward into the arches of the frame. In 
those distant vistas appear the Magi wending their way to 
Bethlehem; towns and castles mark their route. So despite the

inscriptions, attesting to Gentiles contact with Islamic works, 
probably in Venice.) The kings, also given halos, stand not only 
for the international acknowledgement of Christ s divinity, but 
for the three ages of man: youth, middle age, and old age. The 
artist crowds the space, and the festive pageant almost over¬ 
whelms the Holy Family with its profusion of men and beasts, 
including some marvelously rendered horses. Despite this crowd¬ 
ing, a golden light unites the whole image, illuminating the bodies 
of the animals, the faces of the humans, and parts of the landscape. 
These forms are softly modeled to suggest volume for the figures 
and to counteract the strong flattening effect of the gold. The pre- 
della scene of the Nativity (fig. 15.22) demonstrates this aspect of 
Gentile s art further, as it stresses the function of light over line to 
delineate the forms. What is more, the source for the light that 
models the figures and the shed in the predella is the mystical light 
emanating from the Christ Child himself. Gentile s picture reveals 
his awareness of light as a carrier of meaning. 

MASACCIO AT SANTA MARIA NOVELLA Gentile s refined style 
made him very popular among aristocratic patrons throughout 
Italy, but it was his approach to light that would strongly 
influence younger painters. One such was Masaccio (Tommaso 
di Ser Giovanni di Mone Cassai, 1401-1428). Leon Battista 
Alberti, a contemporary of Massaccio, celebrated the young 
painters work in his treatise “On Painting,” finished around 
1435. Vasari noted that many sixteenth-century artists admired 
Masaccio, but nonetheless, in the 1560s, he covered up one of 
Masaccio s most famous works in Santa Maria Novella (fig. 15.23) 
when he remodeled the church. Ultimately, this action probably 
saved Masaccio s work, but much about its commissioning and 
meaning remains obscure. 

Because the fresco originally stood above a tomb slab for the 
Lenzi family, many scholars have concluded that they commis¬ 
sioned Masaccio to paint the fresco depicting the Holy Trinity in 
the company of the Virgin, St. John the Evangelist, and the two 
donors. The lowest section depicts a skeleton lying on a sarcoph¬ 
agus. An inscription (in Italian) reads, “What I once was, you are; 
what I am, you will become. ” The large scale, balanced composi¬ 
tion, and sculptural volume of the figures in this painting have 
their origins in the art of Giotto (see figs. 13.17-13.20). But 
although Giotto was a starting point for Masaccio, in Giotto s 
work, body and drapery form a single unit, whereas Masaccio s 
figures, like Donatello s, are “clothed nudes,” whose drapery falls 
in response to the body underneath. 

The setting reveals the artist s awareness of Brunelleschi s new 
architecture and of his system of perspective. (See Materials and 
Techniques , page 516.) The tall pilasters next to the painted 
columns recall the pilasters Brunelleschi designed for the Old 
Sacristy, as do the simple moldings that define the arch and the 
entablature of this fictive chapel. Masaccio s use of perspective 
gives the spectator all the data needed to measure the depth of this 
painted interior, to draw its plan, and to envision the structure in 
three dimensions. This barrel-vaulted chamber is not a shallow 
niche, but a deep space in which the figures can move freely. The

picture space is independent of the figures; they inhabit the space, 
but they do not create it. Masaccio used Brunelleschi s invention 
to create an illusion of space where none exists. 

All the lines perpendicular to the picture plane converge 
toward a point below the foot of the Cross, on the platform that 
supports the kneeling donors. To see the fresco correctly, we must 
face this point, which is at an eye level somewhat more than 5 feet 
above the floor of the church. The figures within the chamber are 
5 feet tall, slightly less than life-size, while the donors, who are 
closer to the viewer, are fully life-size. The framework therefore is 
“life-size,” too, since it is directly behind the donors. The chapel 
that opens out behind them seems to belong to the same scale: It 
moves backward into space, covered by a barrel vault. That vault 
is subdivided by square coffers, an echo of the dome of the 
Pantheon (see fig. 7.25). The space seems measurable, palpable. 
Fiowever, the position of God the Father is puzzling. His arms 
support the Cross, close to the front plane, while his feet rest on 
a ledge attached to a wall. It is difficult to measure the distance to 
the ledge; if it is against the back wall, then the figure of God 
destroys the spatial effect. But why should the laws of perspective 
constrain God? Another possibility is that Masaccio intended to 
locate the ledge directly behind the Cross, as we can tell by the 
strong shadow that St. John casts on the wall below 

God the Father holds his son while the dove of the Fioly Spirit 
is a further link between them. Masaccio further expresses the 
theme of the Trinity by the triangular composition that begins 
with the donors and rises to the halo of God. Color balances the 
composition, too, as opposing reds and blues unite in the garment 
worn by God. The whole scene has a tragic air, made more solemn 
by the calm gesture of the Virgin, as she points to the Crucifixion, 
and by the understated grief of St. John the Evangelist. The reality 


of death but promise of resurrection is an appropriate theme for a 
funerary commemoration. 

THE BRANCACCI CHAPEL If we are uncertain about the 
identity of the donors for the Trinity fresco, we do know who 
paid for the largest group of Masaccio s surviving works. To ful¬ 
fill a bequest from his uncle Pietro, Felice Brancacci, a wealthy 
silk merchant and sometime ambassador, underwrote the frescoes 
in the Brancacci Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine (figs. 15.24 
and 15.25). The frescoes depict the life of St. Peter. Work began in 
the chapel around 1425, when Masaccio collaborated with a 
slightly older painter named Masolino (1383-ca. 1440). The proj¬ 
ect was left incomplete when both artists were called away to 
work on other commissions. Masaccio went to Rome, where he 
died in 1428. The chapel remained unfinished until the Florentine 
painter Filippino Lippi (1457/58-1504) finally completed the 
lower tier on either side in the 1480s. These frescoes transform the 
space of the chapel into a display of narratives from Scripture. 

The most famous of the frescoes is The Tribute Money by 
Masaccio, located in the upper tier (fig. 15.26). It depicts the story 
told in the Gospel of Matthew (17:24-27) as a continuous narra¬ 
tive. In the center, Christ instructs Peter to catch a fish, whose 
mouth will contain money for the tax collector. On the far left, in 
the distance, Peter takes the coin from the fish s mouth, and on 
the right he gives it to the tax collector. Masaccio uses perspective 
to create a deep space for the narrative and to link the painting s 
space to the space of a viewer, Masaccio models the forms in the 
picture with light that seems to have its source in the real window 
of the chapel. Fie also uses atmospheric perspective in the subtle 
tones of the landscape to make the forms somewhat hazy, seen as 
well in the Ghent Altarpiece by Fiubert and Jan van Eyck (see fig.

14.10). The effect also recalls the setting used a decade earlier in 
Donatello’s small relief of St. George (see fig. 15.12). 

The figures in The Tribute Money , even more than those in the 
Trinity fresco, show Masaccio’s ability to merge the weight and 
volume of Giotto’s figures with the new functional view of body 
and drapery The organization of the central group surrounding 
Christ seems to draw from Nanni di Banco’s Quattro Coronati 
(see fig. 15.10), yet their balanced contrapposto poses may be 


inspired by Donatello. Fine vertical lines scratched in the plaster 
establish the axis of each figure from the head to the heel of the 
engaged leg. In accord with this dignified approach, the figures 
seem rather static. Instead of employing violent physical move¬ 
ment, Masaccios figures here convey the narrative by their 
intense glances and a few strong gestures. 

In The Expulsion from Paradise just to the left (fig. 15.27), 
however, Masaccio shows the human body in motion. The tall, 
narrow format of this fresco leaves little room for a spatial setting. 
The gate of Paradise is barely indicated, and in the background are 
a few shadowy, barren slopes. Yet the soft, atmospheric modeling, 
and especially the boldly foreshortened angel, convey a sense of 
unlimited space. Masaccios grief-stricken Adam and Eve are 
striking representations of the beauty and power of the nude 
human form. 

In contrast to the fluid grace of Gentile da Fabriano’s painting 
(see figs. 15.21 and 15.22), Masaccios paintings represent a less 
beautiful reality. Fiowever, at the Brancacci Chapel and elsewhere, 
Masaccio worked alongside Masolino, who had been strongly 
influenced by Gentile. The two painters worked well together 
and even collaborated on some of the frescoes. (The head of 
Christ in The Tribute Money may be by Masolino.) Nowhere is 
the contrast between the two artists’ styles more striking than in 
The Temptation by Masolino (visible in the upper right of fig. 
15.25). Where Masolino s figures of Adam and Eve are serenely 
beautiful nudes bathed in a diffuse natural light, Masaccios 
express powerful emotion through their sheer physicality. Before 
he could finish the Brancacci Chapel, Masaccio left for Rome to 
work on another commission; he died there at a very young 
age, but his work stimulated other painters to experiment with 
perspectival space. 

Florentine Painters in the Age of the Medici 

Florentine politics played a role in delaying the completion of the 
Brancacci Chapel. The patron, Felice Brancacci, was the son-in- 
law of Palla Strozzi and part of a political faction that drove 
Cosimo de’ Medici into exile in 1433. When Cosimo returned to 
Florence in 1434, he expelled both the Strozzi and the Brancacci 
from the city The Medici family consolidated their power to 
become the most powerful family in Florence, a position they 
maintained until 1494. 

Across four generations, Medici men were active in govern¬ 
ment and in business, while Medici women contributed to the 
social and religious life of the city The family’s wealth came from 
their mercantile and banking interests and the wise political 
alliances they struck both within Florence and in other Italian 
centers. As bankers to the pope, the Medici became leaders in the 
Florentine pro-papal party, and ultimately became the de facto 
rulers of the city. 

Their fortunes had been made at the end of the fourteenth cen¬ 
tury by the shrewd investments of Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici 
(1360-1429). His son Cosimo (1389-1464) was involved in the 
factional disputes of the 1430s, resulting in his exile from the city 


530 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






in 1433. But in 1434 his party triumphed, and Cosimo returned as 
the leader of the Florentine government. Cosimo s sons Piero 
(1416-1469) and Giovanni (1421-1463) followed their fathers 
example; and Pieros son, Lorenzo, called “The Magnificent” 
(1449-1492), became one of the most celebrated and well- 
connected men of the century. In addition to creating links 
to other prominent families in Florence and beyond, the Medici 
family promoted the literary and educational innovations of 
Florentine humanists, and actively used works of art to express 
their political and social status. This period of Medici domination 
saw the continued development of the stylistic innovations of 
the early fifteenth century along with new themes in art. Painters 
working in Florence from the 1430s to the 1460s were profoundly 
affected by the achievements of Masaccio and Donatello, 
Brunelleschis antiquity-inspired architecture, and the drive 
toward greater naturalism. In addition, this generation of painters 
became very proficient at the technique of linear perspective. 
Their works executed for religious settings throughout the city 
treat sacred figures with a new reality. 

FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO With the support of 
Cosimo de’ Medici, the Dominicans built a second convent for 
their friars in Florence in 1436. Among the members of this 
community was a talented painter from the Florentine country¬ 
side, Fra (Brother) Giovanni da Fiesole, called Fra Angelico 
(ca. 1400-1455). For this new community, Angelico painted 


altarpieces, books, and many frescoes in the friars’ living quarters. 
His Annunciation fresco, executed between 1440 and 1445, is 
placed prominently at the entry to the dormitory (fig. 15.28). 
Angelico sets the angel and Mary into a vaulted space very simi¬ 
lar to the real architecture of the convent, itself inspired by 
Brunelleschi. A perspectival scheme defines the space, although 
the figures are too large to stand comfortably in it. The Virgin and 
the angel Gabriel glance at each other across the space; they 
humbly fold their hands, expressing their submission to divine 
will. The forms are graceful, and the overall scene is spare, rather 
than extravagant. The colors are pale, the composition has been 
pared to the minimum, and the light bathes all the forms in a soft 
glow. Angelicos composition has the simplicity and spatial 
sophistication of Masaccio (see fig. 15.26), with figures that are as 
graceful as Gentile da Fabriano s (see fig. 15.21). An inscription at 
the base of the fresco calls on the friars who pass by to say an Ave 
Maria. The fresco enhanced their life of prayer and contempla¬ 
tion, as was the goal of such imagery in religious communities. 

CASTAGNO AT SAN T’APOLLON I A Florence was home to 
many convents of women whose residents also wished to adorn 
their establishments. Unlike Fra Angelico, however, few nuns had 
the opportunity to train as painters to do the work themselves. 
Thus, professional painters like Andrea del Castagno (ca. 
1423-1457) were hired to provide convent spaces with appropri¬ 
ate imagery. For the Benedictine convent of Sant’Apollonia,

CHAPTER 1 5 THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IN FIFTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 531 
















Castagno painted his most famous fresco, The Last Supper (fig. 
15.29) around 1447. This fresco is the best preserved of a series 
he painted in the refectory (dining hall) of the convent. The image 
depicts the events of Holy Thursday, when Jesus and his apostles 
gather to dine, and Jesus reveals that he will be betrayed. 
Castagno sets the event in a richly paneled alcove framed by 
classicizing pilasters and other antique decorative elements. By 
skillfully using perspective, Castagno creates a stagelike space for 
the event. Strong contrasts of light and dark define sculpturally 
imagined figures seated around the table. As in medieval represen¬ 
tations of the subject, Judas sits alone on the near side of the table. 
The symmetry of the architecture, emphasized by the colorful 
inlays, imposes a similar order among the figures and threatens to 
imprison them. There is little communication among the apos¬ 
tles—only a glance here, a gesture there—so that a brooding 
silence hovers over the scene. Breaking with the demands of tra¬ 
dition and perspective, Castagno used a daring device to disrupt 
the symmetry and focus on the drama of the scene. Five of the six 
marble panels on the wall behind the table are filled with subdued 
colored marble, but above the heads of St. Peter, Judas, and Jesus, 
the marble s veining is so garish and explosive that a bolt of light¬ 
ning seems to descend on Judas’ head to focus attention on these 
key figures. This theme often adorned Florentine refectories as 
the monks or nuns imitated Christ and the apostles as they dined. 
The sisters who dined in front of this fresco could see in it exam¬ 
ples to follow and to avoid. 

DOMENICO VENEZIANO AT SANTA LUCIA DEI MAGNOLI 

Religious imagery adorned the altars of parish churches to 
instruct the laity. An important shift occurred in the design of 
altar panels in the 1440s, perhaps at the hands of Fra Angelico, 


that was soon adopted by many painters. Earlier altarpieces, like 
Gentiles Adoration of the Magi (see fig. 15.21), were complex 
ensembles with elaborately carved frames, but the newer altar- 
pieces emphasized gilded carpentry less and geometric clarity 
more. For the main altar of the church of Santa Lucia dei Magnoli 
in Florence, Domenico Veneziano (ca. 1410-1461) executed the 
Madonna and Child with Saints around 1445 (fig. 15.30). As his 
name suggests, Domenico was from Venice; he came to Florence 
in search of work in 1439. A letter he addressed to the son of 
Cosimo de’ Medici in 1438 reveals that he knew about the com¬ 
missions being awarded there (see Primary Source , page 534), 
while his work shows that he had studied Florentine artists. The 
altarpiece he painted for Santa Lucia depicts an enthroned 
Madonna and Child framed by architecture and surrounded by 
saints, including Zenobius, a patron saint of Florence, and Lucy, 
an early Christian martyr, who holds a dish containing her eyes. 

The theme of the central Madonna surrounded by saints and 
sometimes angels is often termed a sacra conversazione (sacred 
conversation), which suggests that the image is not a narrative, but 
a glimpse of a heavenly court peopled by dignified and decorous 
courtiers. Domenico imagines this gathering in a light-filled log¬ 
gia articulated with pink and green marble. The architecture is 
clear and convincing, yet the space it defines is an ideal one ele¬ 
vated above the everyday world. Domenico may have modeled 
this space on Masaccio s Holy Trinity fresco (see fig. 15.23), for his 
St. John (second from left) looks at us while pointing toward the 
Madonna, repeating the glance and gesture of Masaccio s Virgin. 
Domenico s perspective setting is worthy of Masaccio s, although 
his architectural forms have Gothic proportions and arches. The 
slim, sinewy bodies of the male saints, with their highly individu¬ 
alized, expressive faces, show Donatello s influence (see fig. 15.12).

Domenico treats color as an integral part of his work. This 
sacra conversazione is as noteworthy for its palette as for its com¬ 
position. The blond tonality—its harmony of pink, light green, 
and white set off by spots of red, blue, and yellow—reconciles the 
brightness of Gothic panel painting with natural light and per- 
spectival space. The sunlight streams in from the right, as revealed 
by the cast shadow behind the Madonna. The surfaces reflect the 
light so strongly that even the shadowed areas glow with color. 
Color, light, and space come together in this painting to make a 
heavenly vision in which the faithful may take comfort. 


DOMESTIC LIFE: PALACES, 
FURNISHINGS, AND PAINTINGS 
IN MEDICEAN FLORENCE 


Patrons like Giovanni Rucellai or Cosimo de 5 Medici asked artists 
to create works of art for their homes as well as for their churches. 
As family fortunes rose, palaces needed building or remodeling to 
provide an appropriate setting for family life and civic display. 
Furnishings within the home had to express the status of the fam¬ 
ily Sculptures and paintings of new sorts, such as cassone paint¬ 
ings (see page 537), proclaimed the alliances between families. 
Works of art depicted new subjects, many of them inspired by 
antique art, which reflected the humanist educations of both 
artists and patrons. In sculpture, the long-lived Donatello was an 


inspiration for younger sculptors like Pollaiuolo. Painters tacked 
between the grave simplicity of Masaccio and the idealized ele¬ 
gance of Gentile da Fabriano to find the right language to depict 
imagery drawn from the ancient world. Architects such as 
Michelozzo built family homes endowed with great dignity by 
their use of classical forms. 


Palace Architecture 

As their status rose in Florence, the Medici required a more 
lavish palace to house them and accommodate political and diplo¬ 
matic functions. Nevertheless, Cosimo de’ Medici turned down a 
design by Brunelleschi for this project, perhaps because he found 
it ostentatious. The commission went instead to a younger archi¬ 
tect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo (1396-1472), who had worked as 
a sculptor with both Ghiberti and Donatello. His design (fig. 
15.31) recalls the fortresslike Florentine palaces of old; it may 
have been this conservatism that appealed to Cosimo. (The win¬ 
dows on the ground floor were added by Michelangelo in 
1516-17, and the whole was extended by the Riccardi family in 
the seventeenth century.)

OURCE 


Domenico Veneziano 
Solicits Work 



The Venetian painter wrote to Piero de’ Medici in 1438 requesting that 
he he considered for a commission that the family was about to award. 
The letter reveals Domenico's knowledge of the work to he done , and 
his arguments for why he should do it. 

T o the honorable and generous man Piero di Cosimo de’ Medici 
of Florence. ... 

Honorable and generous sir. After the due salutations. I inform 
you that by Gods grace I am well. And I wish to see you well and 
happy. Many, many times I have asked about you. ... [A]nd having 
first learned where you were, I would have written to you for my 
comfort and duty. Considering that my low condition does not 
deserve to write to your nobility, only the perfect and good love I 
have for you and all your people gives me the daring to write, consid¬ 
ering how duty-bound I am to do so. 

Just now I have heard that Cosimo [Piero’s father] has decided 
to have an altarpiece made, in other words painted, and wants a 


magnificent work, which pleases me very much. And it would 
please me more if through your generosity I could paint it. And if 
that happens, I am in hopes with Gods help to do marvelous things, 
although there are good masters like Fra Filippo [Lippi] and Fra 
Giovanni [Angelico] who have much work to do. Fra Filippo in par¬ 
ticular has a panel going to Santo Spirito which he won’t finish in five 
years working day and night, it’s so big. But however that may be, my 
great good will to serve you makes me presume to offer myself. And 
in case I should do less well than anyone at all, I wish to be obligated 
to any merited punishment, and to provide any test sample needed, 
doing honor to everyone. And if the work were so large that Cosimo 
decided to give it to several masters, or else more to one than to 
another, I beg you as far as a servant may beg a master that you may 
be pleased to enlist your strength favorably and helpfully to me in 
arranging that I may have some little part of it ... and I promise you 
my work will bring you honor. ... 

By your most faithful servant Domenico da Veneziano painter, 
commending himself to you, in Perugia, 1438, first of April.

Michelozzo borrowed the rustication from the Palazzo della 
Signoria (see fig. 13.15), but he lightened the forms significantly. 
The three stories form a graded sequence: The lowest features

rough-hewn, “rusticated” masonry; the second has smooth¬ 
surfaced blocks; and the third has an unbroken surface. The 
building seems heavier on the bottom and lighter above. On top 
of the structure rests, like a lid, a strongly projecting cornice of 
the sort found on Roman temples. Inside, the spaces of the palace 
open to a central courtyard defined by an arcade resting on 
Brunelleschian classicizing columns (fig. 15.32). The arcade sup¬ 
ports a frieze with carved medallions featuring symbols favored 
by the Medici (the seven balls are on the Medici coat of arms) and 
sgraffito ornament (incised decorative designs). The double¬ 
lancet windows of the facade reappear here. The effect of the 
whole is to provide a splendid setting for Medici affairs: familial, 
social, commercial, and governmental. Thus, the large courtyard 
that dominates the interior is ceremonial as well as practical. 

DONATELLO’S DAVID One of the most debated works of the 
Renaissance, Donatello s bronze David (fig. 15.33), once stood on 
a high pedestal in the courtyard of the Medici palace. The David 
may be the first free-standing, life-size nude statue made since 
antiquity. The sheer expense of casting a whole figure of this sort 
in bronze, and with gilt parts, required a patron with the wealth 
of the Medici to pay for it. Using the lost-wax method of casting 
(see Materials and Techniques , page 128), Donatello composed the 
figure to be seen from every side, as the contrapposto stance and 
high finish of the work demand that a viewer walk around it. 

Both the date of the David and its interpretation have sparked 
controversy. The evidence for its date is unclear; the only firm 
documentation places it in the Medici palace by 1469; scholars 
have proposed dates from the 1420s to 1460s. Much in the figure 
is difficult to square with the biblical story. The young David 
stands with his left foot atop the severed head of the giant

Goliath, whom he has miraculously defeated. Nonetheless, 
Donatello depicts the already victorious David still holding the 
stone that bought Goliath down. Most untraditionally, he also 
depicts David nude, which may be intended to suggest his status 
as a hero in the ancient mode. But instead of depicting him as a 
full-grown youth like the athletes of Greece, Donatello chose to 
model an adolescent boy with a softly sensuous torso, like Isaac 
in Ghibertis competition panel (see fig. 15.2). The David's con- 
trapposto alludes to ancient sources, but it also gives the nude 
youth a languid pose, which some critics have seen as sexually 
suggestive. The broad-brimmed hat and knee-high boots seem to 


accentuate his nudity David wields Goliaths sword, which is too 
large for him, and his gaze seems impassive when we consider the 
terror he has just confronted. 

One key to the meaning of the David may be an inscription 
once written on its base that identified David as the defender of 
the fatherland: Since David had been venerated as a patron of the 
city, the Medici chose to appropriate this symbol of Florentine 
civic virtue and install it in their residence. (Donatello had earlier 
sculpted a marble image of David that stood in the Palazzo della 
Signoria, so even the choice of sculptor may be significant.) But 
scholars have debated the specific associations of the statue: one 
proposal is that the David celebrates a particular Florentine mili¬ 
tary victory, or perhaps a Medici political victory; another pro¬ 
posal is that it represents Florentine vigilance, or is a symbol of 
republican victory over tyranny. At the same time, its presence in 
the Medici palace may turn it into a symbol of dynastic power. All 
of this is made more complicated by the figure s youth and nudity. 
Our understanding of how fifteenth-century Florentines viewed 
the sculpture is still developing. 

HERCULEAN IMAGES The Medici family appear to have made 
a habit of borrowing Florentine civic imagery for their palace. 
Sometime around 1475, Antonio del Pollaiuolo (1431-1498) exe¬

the David , this is a table statue, only about 18 inches high, but it 
has the visual impact of a much larger object. It represents 
Hercules—another patron of Florence—battling Antaeus, the son 
of an earth goddess. Antaeus gains strength from contact with the 
earth, so Hercules must lift him off the ground to defeat him. 
Pollaiuolo had been trained as a goldsmith and metalworker, 
probably in the Ghiberti workshop, but was deeply impressed by 
the work of Donatello and Andrea del Castagno, as well as by 
ancient art. All these sources influence the distinctive style of 
the statuette. 

To create a free-standing group of two struggling figures, even 
on a small scale, was a daring idea. There is no precedent for this 
design among earlier statuary groups, whether from antiquity or 
the Renaissance. Even bolder is the centrifugal force of the com¬ 
position. Limbs seem to move outward in every direction, so the 
viewer must examine the statuette from all sides. Despite its vio¬ 
lent action, the group is in perfect balance. To stress the central 
axis, Pollaiuolo in effect grafted the upper part of Antaeus onto 
the lower part of Hercules as he lifts him in a stranglehold. 
Pollaiuolo was a painter and engraver as well as a bronze sculptor, 
and we know that about 1465 he did a closely related painting of 
Hercules and Antaeus for the Medici. 

Few of Pollaiuolo s paintings have survived, and only one 
engraving, the Battle of the Nudes (fig. 15.35). The latter is one of 
Pollaiuolos most elaborate designs. Its subject is not known, 


though it may derive from an ancient text. One purpose the 
engraving serves is to display the artist s mastery of the nude body 
in action and thus to advertise his skill. This may account for the 
prominent signature in the print; he signs it “Opus Antonii 
Pollaioli Florentini” (“The work of Antonio Pollaiuolo of 
Florence”). In 1465-70, when the print must have been produced, 
depicting the nude in action was still a novel problem, which 
Pollaiuolo explored in his paintings, sculptures, and prints. He 
realized that a full understanding of movement demanded a 
detailed knowledge of anatomy, down to the last muscle and 
sinew. These naked men look almost as if their skin has been 
stripped off to reveal the play of muscles underneath. So, to a 
lesser extent, do the two figures of Pollaiuolo s statuette Hercules 
and Antaeus. 

Paintings for Palaces 

The interiors of patrician palaces served not only as private quar¬ 
ters and settings for family life, but as public spaces where family 
members performed civic roles. A visitor would find paintings 
and perhaps sculptures, many on religious subjects, in these 
buildings. Indeed, early in the fifteenth century, one of the lead¬ 
ing clerics of Tuscany urged that religious images be displayed in 
private homes. In a treatise written in 1403, Cardinal Giovanni 
Dominici counseled that images of Christ, Mary, and saints in the 


536 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 









home would encourage children to emulate those holy figures. 
(See Primary Source, page 539.) 

Patrician homes also showcased cassoni (sing, cassone), carved 
or painted chests for storing valuables. The product of collabora¬ 
tion between skilled carpenters, woodworkers, and painters, such 
chests were usually decorated, sometimes with military imagery, 
like the one in figure 15.36, which bears the arms of the Strozzi 
family. This chest probably came from the busy workshop of 
Apollonio di Giovanni (1414-1465) and Marco del Buono 
Giamberti (1402-1489). Its front panel depicts the conquest of 
Trebizond (a town on the Black Sea) by Turkish forces in 1461; as 
a result, Venetian traders were expelled and Florence increased its 
influence in the Mediterranean. The busy composition features 
small figures battling in front of a city wall; their armor is gilded 
to create a sumptuous surface. Antique-inspired scrolls flank the 
narrative, while the heavy lid and base shine with gold. 

Cassoni were also adorned with scenes from mythology, 
history, and romance. Pairs of cassoni were usually given to a 
bride on her wedding; they mark the union of two families, and 
thus reflect family status as much as nuptial concerns. Edifying or 
learned stories on cassoni often derived from studies of ancient 
authors such as Plutarch, Ovid, or Vergil. Thus, cassone panels 
displayed a family’s wealth, their learning and interest in human¬ 
ism, sometimes their patriotism, and very often lessons for a bride 
to take with her to her new home. 

Another type of domestic decoration was the circular paint¬ 
ing, or tondo, which was something of a Florentine specialty. 
Many of the leading painters of the middle and later decades of 
the fifteenth century produced tondi, including Fra Filippo Lippi 


(ca. 1406-1469), to whom has been attributed the Madonna and 
Child with the Birth of the Virgin (fig. 15.37). The Florentine 
banker Lionardo Bartolini Salimbeni may have commissioned 
this panel to commemorate a birth in his family. Lippi presents 
the Madonna and infant Jesus as an exemplary mother and child. 
Fra Filippo s youthful Mary has a slender elegance and gentle 
sweetness that may derive from Fra Angelico s work (see fig. 
15.28), although his figures and setting are more complicated and 
ornate. The curly edge of the Virgin s headdress and the curved 
folds of her mantle streaming to the left, which accentuate her 
turn to the right, add a lyrical quality to her figure. The child Jesus 
picks seeds out of a pomegranate, an emblem of eternal life. At the 
same time, the seeds may also symbolize fertility, since the sec¬ 
ondary theme here is St. Anne giving birth to the Virgin. 

Behind the Virgin is a stagelike scene that is surprisingly clut¬ 
tered, created by a perspective scheme with several vanishing 
points. In the background to the left is a domestic interior show¬ 
ing the Virgin s birth, with St. Anne in childbed. To the right is the 
meeting of St. Anne and her husband, St. Joachim at the Golden 
Gate of Jerusalem, after an angel had appeared to them separately 
and promised them a child. In contrast to all other depictions of 
this legend, the event in this painting is presented as if it were 
taking place before the entrance to a private house. 

Lippi could have learned to use this kind of continuous narra¬ 
tive from reliefs by Donatello and Ghiberti: Compare The Feast 
of Herod (see fig. 15.13) and The Story of Jacob and Esau (see fig. 
15.17), which incorporate similarly complex spaces to tell their 
stories. Lippi quotes from Ghiberti s relief in this tondo in the fig¬ 
ure of the maidservant to the right of the Virgin. After Masaccio s

death, the age, experience, and prestige of Donatello and Ghiberti 
gave them an authority unmatched by any other painter active at 
the time. Their influence, and that of the Flemish masters, on Fra 
Filippo’s outlook was of great importance, since he played a vital 
role in setting the course of Florentine painting during the second 
half of the century 

UCCELLO’S BATTLE OF SAN ROMANO The same family 
linked to Lippi’s tondo commissioned a set of wall paintings with 
a fascinating history. The Florentine artist Paolo Uccello 
(1397-1475) painted the Battle of San Romano (fig. 15.38) as one 
of three panels depicting a battle between Florence and Lucca in 
1432. Florence’s victory in this battle was one of the factors that 
led to Cosimo de’ Medicis consolidation of power. Uccello 
depicts the charge of the Florentine forces led by Cosimo s ally, 
Niccolo da Tolentino, the man on the white horse wielding a 
generals baton at the center of the painting. Because of the 
importance of this subject to the Medici, scholars long believed 
that they commissioned this painting. The series was identified as 
one described as hanging in Lorenzo de’ Medici’s bedroom in a 
document of 1492. Recent research, however, shows that it was 
Lionardo Bartolini Salimbeni, who was a member of the govern¬ 
ing council of Florence during the battle, who commissioned 
Uccello to paint these panels for his town house in Florence 
around 1438. After his death, Lorenzo de’ Medici sought to 


obtain them, first by purchase and, when that failed, by force. 
The sons of the original owner filed a lawsuit for their return. 
These circumstances suggest the importance of the paintings for 
both families. 

Uccello’s painting seems to record a ceremony rather than a war, 
as the plastic shapes of the figures and horses march across a grid 
consisting of discarded weapons and pieces of armor. These objects 
form the orthogonals of a perspective scheme that is neatly arranged 
to include a fallen soldier. A thick hedge of bushes defines this fore¬ 
ground plane, beyond which appears a landscape that rises up the 
picture plane rather than receding deeply into space. Spots of bril¬ 
liant color and a lavish use of gold reinforce the surface pattern, 
which would have been more brilliant originally, as some of the 
armor is covered in silver foil that has now tarnished. Such splendid 
surfaces remind us of the paintings of Gentile da Fabriano (see fig. 
15.21). Uccello’s work owes much to International Gothic dis¬ 
plays of lavish materials and flashes of natural observation, with 
the added element of perspectival renderings of forms and space. 

MYTHOLOGIES FOR MEDICI PALACES In addition to 
acquiring paintings in Florence through commission, purchase, or 
force, the Medici had numerous contacts with northern Europe, 
not only through diplomatic exchanges, but through their bank¬ 
ing business. Medici agents in Bruges sent many works of art to 
Florence, as inventories confirm. In this, the Medici behaved as

Giovanni Dominici Urges 
Parents to Put Religious 
Images in Their Homes 

Florentine by birth , Dominici entered the Dominican order , where he 
became involved with re form. Among his writings was the Regola del 
governo di cura familiare ("Rule for the Management of Family Care ) of 
1403 , from which this excerpt is taken. 

P art IV [on the management of children]. In the first consideration, 
which is to bring them up for God ... you should observe five 
little rules. ... The first is to have paintings in the house, of holy little 
boys or young virgins, in which your child when still in swaddling 
clothes may delight, as being like himself, and may be seized upon by 
the like thing, with actions and signs attractive to infancy. And as I 
say for painting, so I say of sculptures. The Virgin Mary is good to 
have, with the child on her arm, and the little bird or the pomegran¬ 
ate in his fist. A good figure would be Jesus suckling, Jesus sleeping 
on his mother s lap, Jesus standing politely before her, Jesus making 
a hem and the mother sewing that hem. In the same way he may 


mirror himself in the holy Baptist, dressed in camel skin, a small boy 
entering the desert, playing with birds, sucking on the sweet leaves, 
sleeping on the ground. It would do no harm if he saw Jesus and the 
Baptist, the little Jesus and the Evangelist grouped together, and the 
murdered innocents, so that fear of arms and armed men would 
come over him. And so too little girls should be brought up in the 
sight of the eleven thousand virgins, discussing, fighting and praying. 
I would like them to see Agnes with the fat lamb, Cecilia crowned 
with roses, Elizabeth with many roses, Catherine on the wheel, with 
other figures that would give them love of virginity with their 
mothers' milk, desire for Christ, hatred of sins, disgust at vanity, 
shrinking from bad companions, and a beginning, through consider¬ 
ing the saints, of contemplating the supreme saint of saints. ... I warn 
you if you have paintings in your house for this purpose, avoid 
frames of gold and silver, lest they become more idolatrous than 
faithful, since, if they see more candles lit and more hats removed and 
more kneeling to figures that are gilded and adorned with precious 
stones than to the old smoky ones, they will only learn to revere gold 
and jewels, and not the figures, or rather, the truths represented by 
those figures.

did many of the ruling families of Italy, for Flemish art was widely 
admired in places as disparate as Naples, Venice, Ferrara, Urbino, 
and Milan. Through such acquisitions, the Medici palace was 
filled with panel paintings and tapestries from the North. These 
objects made a profound impression on Florentine artists like 
Paolo Uccello, Filippo Lippi, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and the 
young Sandro Botticelli. 

Botticelli (1445-1510), who had trained with Fra Filippo 
Lippi, became one of the favorite painters of the Medici circle— 
the group of nobles, scholars, and poets surrounding Lorenzo the 
Magnificent, the head of the Medici family and, for all practical 
purposes, the real ruler of the city from 1469 until 1492. The 
Primavera (Spring ) (fig. 15.39) was probably painted for a cousin 
who grew up in the household of Lorenzo the Magnificent. This 
work, and two others on the theme of love, may have been com¬ 
missioned for the young mans wedding, which took place in 
1482, the date often proposed for the painting. 

Scholars have proposed numerous interpretations of this 
image. The painting depicts Venus in her sacred grove, with 
Eros flying overhead. Her companions, the Three Graces and 
Hermes (the Roman god Mercury), stand on the left; to the right, 
the wind-god Zephyr reaches for the nymph Chloris, whom he 


then transforms into Flora, the goddess of flowers. One interpre¬ 
tation links the Primavera to the writings of the Neo-Platonist 
philosopher Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), who was widely read 
and admired at the Medici court. Ficino assigned to Venus the 
virtues (or graces) desirable in women. With her modest garment 
and gentle gestures, Venus is the reigning divinity in this fertile 
garden. At left, Mercury keeps clouds away, while Flora embod¬ 
ies fertility. Other readings of the Primavera see it as an allegory 
about the immortality of the soul (drawing a parallel between the 
story of Chloris and the Rape of Persephone). Since the painting 
was made in connection with a wedding, it may be a celebration 
of marriage and fertility, as the dense thicket of orange trees and 
carpet of flowers seem to suggest. 

Often paired with the Primavera in the public imagination is 
Botticellis most famous image, The Birth of Venus (fig. 15.40), 
which also once hung in a Medici villa. It may have been painted 
several years later, however. In this painting, too, the central fig¬ 
ure in the composition is Venus, though here she floats slowly 
toward the shore, where a flower-clad woman waits to enfold her 
in a flowered robe. Her movement is aided by Zephyr accompa¬ 
nied by Chloris (Flora). Unlike the Primavera , here the space 
behind the figures seems to open out into the distance, with the

sky and water creating a light, cool tonality for the painting. In 
the figures, though, the shallow modeling and emphasis on 
outline produce an effect of low relief rather than of solid, three- 
dimensional shapes. The bodies seem to be drained of all weight, 
so that they float even when they touch the ground. 

These ethereal figures re-create ancient forms. Botticelli s fig¬ 
ure of Venus depends on a variant of the Aphrodite of Knidas by 
Praxiteles (see fig. 5.56). The subject itself seems related to the 
Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite , which begins: “I shall sing of beau¬ 
tiful Aphrodite...who is obeyed by the flowery sea-girt land of 
Cyprus, whither soft Zephyr and the breeze wafted her in soft 
foam over the waves. Gently the golden-filleted Horae received 
her, and clad her in divine garments.” Still, no single literary 
source accounts for the pictorial conception. It may owe some¬ 
thing to Ovid and the poet Poliziano, who was, like Botticelli, a 
member of the Medici circle. But again, the thinking of Marsilio 
Ficino may play a role here. Among the Neo-Platonists, Venus 
appears in two guises, a celestial Venus and a mundane Venus; the 
former was a source of divine love, the latter of physical love. The 
Birth ofVenus may be an allegory of the origin of the celestial 
Venus for an audience attuned to the nuances of Neo-Platonic 
philosophy. The elegant forms and high finish of the painting, 


combined with the erudite subject matter based on ancient 
thought, exemplify the taste of the Medici court. 

Portraiture 

Images of history, of contemporary events, or of ancient myths 
demonstrate the increasing interest in secular themes in the art of 
the Renaissance. Another genre of image in great demand was the 
portrait. In addition to dynastic images for kings, or monuments 
to war heroes, the second half of the fifteenth century saw the 
spread of portraits of merchants, brides, and artists. 

The idea of recording specific likenesses was inspired by the 
fifteenth century’s increasing awareness of the individual, but 
also by the study of Roman art, where portraits abound. Artists 
were already making donor portraits like Masaccios Trinity 
fresco (see fig. 15.23), funerary monuments like Bruni s tomb (fig. 
15.18), and commemorations of public figures like Donatellos 
Gattamelata (fig. 15.14), but new forms of portraiture developed 
in the fifteenth century 

The Florentine painter Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449-1494) 
inserted portraits of his patrons and their families into the many 
fresco cycles he painted, but he also made portraits as stand-alone

paintings. Florentine artists before Ghirlandaio, as he himself did 
too, produced profile portraits in emulation of Roman coins. But 
around 1480, both Ghirlandaio and his younger colleague 
Botticelli began to adopt the three-quarter view (the sitter half 
turned toward the viewer, between profile and frontal gaze) in 
their portraits, and the practice soon became widespread. Both 
profile and three-quarter views appear in Ghirlandaios most 
touching individual portrait, An Old Man and a Young Boy (fig. 
15.41), usually dated to around 1480. Despite the very specific 
physiognomy of the old man, whose nose has been disfigured by 
rosacea (a skin disorder), the sitters and their relationship to each 
other are unknown. Their intimate gestures suggest that they rep¬ 
resent two generations of one family; if so, the painting depicts 
the continuity of the family line. Leon Battista Alberti defined the 
function of portraits as being “to make the absent present,” which 
may be the case with this image; it appears to be based on a draw¬ 
ing taken at the time of the old man’s death. The connection 
between generations depicted in this family group may be more 
symbolic than real. Even though the textures are somewhat 
generalized and the composition geometrically ordered, 
Ghirlandaio s attention to detail may reflect his acquaintance with 


Netherlandish art. The landscape view through the window that 
breaks up the picture plane was also a northern European idea 
(see fig. 14.21). But the most important contribution was the 
three-quarter view of the human face, which had been used in 
Flanders since the 1420s. 

Portraits in three dimensions enjoyed a certain vogue in the 
fifteenth century, too, especially among the wealthiest families. 
The Medici commissioned numerous family likenesses for their 
palaces and for their friends, but they preferred the portrait bust, 
a shoulder-length sculptural likeness. This form was most likely 
to draw parallels between themselves and Roman families who 
owned numerous busts of their ancestors (see fig. 7.12). The 
Florentine busts celebrated the living, however, not the dead, and 
were made of marble, bronze, or terra cotta by some of the lead¬ 
ing sculptors of the century. Piero de’ Medici and his wife, 
Lucrezia Tornabuoni, were recorded in such busts, as were their 
sons, Giuliano and Lorenzo de’ Medici. The format was used for 
portraits of both men and women, including that shown in figure 
15.42. Dated to around 1475-80, this marble bust by Verrocchio 
depicts a young woman holding a bouquet. It is unusual in showing 
the sitter in half-length, which gives the artist room to render her 


542 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






expressive hands. Her hair is arranged fashionably, though her gar¬ 
ment is simple. Verrocchio manipulates the marble to distinguish 
textural effects of hair, eyebrows, flowers, and the transparent 
undergarment buttoned at her neck. The slight tilt of her head and 
the placement of her hands give the figure movement and grace. 
Although speculation about her identity has suggested a connec¬ 
tion to Lorenzo de’ Medici, the identity of the lady in this lyrical 
portrait remains unknown. 

The court around Lorenzo the Magnificent was learned, ambi¬ 
tious, and very cultivated. Lorenzo was the patron of numerous 
humanists, philosophers, poets, and artists, including the young 
Michelangelo. Yet this brilliant court did not outlast Lorenzo s 
death in 1492. His heir, Piero de’ Medici, did not share his father s 
diplomatic gifts. What is more, he faced an increasingly unstable 
economy (the bank failed in 1494) and invading armies from 
France and Spain. Piero s inept handling of these crises encour¬ 
aged an uprising in Florence in 1494, which expelled the Medici 
faction and sought to restore republican government. The power 
vacuum was filled for a time by the Dominican friar Girolamo 


Savonarola, who attacked the “cult of paganism” and the materi¬ 
alism he saw in Florentine culture. Savonarola’s exhortations to 
repentance and his strong criticism of corruption, not only in 
Florence but in the church hierarchy, made him many enemies, 
and he was executed in 1498. As the fifteenth century came to an 
end, Florence was battling for its life against the stronger powers 
of the papacy, Spain, and France. 

RENAISSANCE ART THROUGHOUT 
ITALY, 1 450-1 500 

Artists from all over Italy and well beyond found in the innova¬ 
tions being explored in Florence a stimulus for their own work, 
though they responded to the new styles in individual ways. 
Additionally, patrons throughout Italy saw the advantages of 
expressing their authority through visual and textual references to 
antiquity. By midcentury, linear perspective was in widespread 
use, and Florentine techniques for rendering form through light 
were being practiced by many artists. Piero della Francesca 
blended his own fascination with mathematics, the ancient world, 
and Flemish painting to create a personal style that found favor in 
several Italian courts. The Florentine humanist and architect Leon 
Battista Alberti designed influential buildings in northern Italy, 
including one for the marquis of Mantua, who had also attracted 
the services of the painter-archaeologist Andrea Mantegna. The 
city of Venice commissioned Florentine artists, such as Andrea 
del Verrocchio, for major projects, but local traditions in architec¬ 
ture and painting remained strong. Venetian painters like 
Giovanni Bellini developed an influential school that rivaled the 
Florentine style. As the papacy regained its control in Rome, 
Perugino and Luca Signorelli created projects designed to 
celebrate papal power. 

Piero della Francesca in Central Italy 

One of the most distinctive and original artists of the second half 
of the fifteenth century was Piero della Francesca (ca. 1420-1492), 
who visited Florence while training with Domenico Veneziano 
(see fig. 15.30). Piero came from Borgo San Sepolcro in southeast¬ 
ern Tuscany, where he completed some of his earliest commis¬ 
sions. He worked for patrons in Tuscany, Rimini, and Ferrara, 
and executed several important works for Federico da 
Montefeltro, a condottiere (mercenary general) turned ruler of 
Urbino (southeast of Tuscany) around 1470. Piero s early training 
with Domenico Veneziano may be seen in his use of color, while 
his experience of Masaccio is apparent in the solidity and simplic¬ 
ity of his forms and the solemn character of his compositions. The 
early fifteenth-century systemization of perspective was critical 
for Piero, who became such an expert at mathematically deter¬ 
mining perspective and at rendering figures in space that he wrote 
a treatise about it. It is likely that Piero made contact with Leon 
Battista Alberti, with whom he shared patrons, as well as an 
interest in art theory.

A work that Piero made for his hometown reflects this com¬ 
bination of influences on his art. The city of Borgo San Sepolcro 
commissioned him to paint a fresco for its Palazzo Comunale, 
probably around 1460. Befitting the name of the town, which 
means the “Holy Sepulcher,” Piero s theme is Christ Resurrected 
stepping out of his tomb (fig. 15.43). The figure of Christ domi¬ 
nates the composition: His frontality and the triangular composi¬ 
tion may derive from works like the Trinity fresco by Masaccio 
(see fig. 15.23), but the light of sunrise and the pale colors reflect 
the art of Domenico Veneziano. The contrast offered by the dead 
trees on the left and the living ones on the right adds to the theme 
of resurrection. Piero pays special attention to the arrangement of 
the Roman soldiers asleep in front of the sepulcher; they are 
variations on a theme of bodies in space. The spectator must look 
up to see the glorified body of Christ, so perfect in his anatomy 
and so serene in his aspect as he triumphs over death. Columns, 
soldiers, and tomb are all rendered as if seen from below, display¬ 
ing Piero s mastery of perspective. 

Piero s art brought him to the attention of the cultivated Duke 
Federico da Montefeltro, who attracted artists from all over 
Europe to his court at Urbino. There, Piero came into contact, 
and perhaps competition, with artists not only from Italy but 
also from Spain and Flanders. From them, Piero learned the new 


technique of painting with oil glazes and became an early practi¬ 
tioner of this technique in central Italy Piero s quiet, spatially 
complex paintings were thus enriched with more brilliant colors 
and surface textures in the style of Flemish art. Piero painted a 
double portrait of the duke and duchess (fig. 15.44) about 1474. 
This painting demonstrates Piero s mastery of spatial representa¬ 
tion and clarity of form by using the rich hues and varied textures 
made possible by oil painting. The diptych portrays both the 
duke and his wife in profile facing each other in front of a deep, 
continuous landscape. Presented in a complex gilded frame, the 
diptych appears much larger and monumental than it really is. 
Federico, whose face had been disfigured in a tournament, shows 
his good side. He is depicted on the reverse of his portrait in ducal 
garb, suggesting a date for the painting after 1474. His wife, 
Battista, had been dead for two years by then, six months after 
providing him with a son and heir. Piero gives her the place of 
honor to the viewer s left. Her pale features are framed by her 
complicated hairstyle and her gems and brocades. A shadow falls 
over the landscape behind her, while the landscape behind her 
husband is lighter and busier. The rigid profiles placed against the 
low horizon and deep landscape give the figures an unapproach¬ 
able and monumental appearance. Piero s balanced and spacious 
composition results in an image of calm authority and triumph.

Sant’Andrea, Mantua. Designed 1470 


Alberti and Mantegna in Mantua 

Duke Federigo was a relative newcomer to power in Urbino, 
but Mantua, in the northern Po Valley, had been dominated for 
more than a century by the Gonzaga family. They created a 
brilliant court, peopled with humanists, educators, and artists. 
Marquis Ludovico Gonzaga had married a German princess, 
Barbara of Brandenburg, and the court was very cosmopolitan. 
Works such as the Ten Books on Architecture (ca. 1452) brought 
Leon Battista Alberti great prominence and the Gonzaga lured 
him to their service. 

In 1470, Alberti had designed the church of Sant’Andrea in 
Mantua, his last work (fig. 15.45). The majestic facade expresses 
Alberti s ultimate goal of merging classical temple forms with the 
traditional basilican church. Here, he interweaves a triumphal 
arch motif, now with a huge recessed center niche to serve as the 
portal, with a classical temple front. To keep the two competing 
forms in equilibrium, he uses flat pilasters that stress the primacy 


of the wall surface. Two sizes of pilaster achieve this balance: The 
smaller pilasters support the arch over the huge central niche, and 
the larger ones support the unbroken architrave and the strongly 
outlined pediment. The larger pilasters form what is known as 
a colossal order, meaning that it is more than one story high. 
These tall pilasters balance the horizontal and vertical elements of 
the design. 

To further unify the facade, Alberti inscribed the entire design 
within a square, even though it made the facade much lower than 
the height of the nave. (The effect of the west wall protruding 
above the pediment appears more disturbing in photographs than 
from street level, where it can hardly be seen.) While the facade is 
distinct from the main body of the structure, it offers a “preview” 
of the interior, where the same colossal order, the same propor¬ 
tions, and the same triumphal-arch motif reappear on the walls of 
the nave (fig. 15.46). Unlike the facade of Santa Maria Novella (see 
fig. 15.9), Alberti announced the interior elevation on the exterior.

1 5.47 Plan of Sant’Andrea (transept, dome, and choir 
are later additions) 


Compared with Brunelleschis San Lorenzo (see fig. 15.8), the 
plan (fig. 15.47) is extraordinarily compact. Had the church been 
completed as planned, the difference would be even more marked. 
Alberti s design had no transept, dome, or choir—all of these 
were added in the mid-eighteenth century; he planned only a nave 
ending in an apse. Following the example of the Basilica of 
Constantine (see figs. 7.60 and 7.61), Alberti replaced the aisles 
with alternating large and small vaulted chapels and eliminated 
the clerestory. The colossal pilasters and the arches of the large 
chapels support a coffered barrel vault of impressive size. (The 
nave is as wide as the facade.) Here, Alberti has drawn upon his 
study of the massive vaulted halls in ancient Roman baths and 
basilicas, but he interprets these models freely to create a structure 
that can truly be called a "Christian temple.” Such a synthesis of 
ancient forms and Christian functions was a primary goal of 
fifteenth-century humanists and their patrician sponsors. 
Albertis accomplishment of this goal at Sant’Andrea would 
inspire many other architects to do the same. 

The humanist court at Mantua played host for many years to 
one of the most intellectually inclined artists of the century,

Andrea del Mantegna (1431 -1506). Trained in Padua, but aware of 
artistic currents in Venice, Florence, and Rome and brother-in- 
law to Giovanni Bellini, Mantegna became court painter to the 
Gonzaga in 1460, a position he held until his death at age 75. His 
interests as a painter, humanist, and archaeologist can be seen in 
the panel depicting St. Sebastian (fig. 15.48), probably painted in 
the 1450s. Sebastian was an early Christian martyr who was 
condemned to be executed by archers. (He recovered from these 
wounds, which may explain why he was invoked so often against 
the plague.) Mantegna depicts the anatomically precise and 
carefully proportioned body of the saint tied to a classical 
column. These forms are crisply drawn and modeled to resemble 
sculpture. Architectural and sculptural classical ruins lie at his feet 
and behind him, and next to him, on the left, is the artist’s signa¬ 
ture in Greek. A road leads into the distance, traversed by the 
archers who have just shot the saint; through this device, 
Mantegna lets the perspectivally constructed space denote the 
passage of time. Beyond these men appears an atmospheric land¬ 
scape and a deep-blue sky dotted with soft white clouds. The 
scene is bathed in warm late-afternoon sunlight, which creates a 
melancholy mood. The light-filled landscape in the background 
indicates Mantegna s awareness of Flemish paintings, which had 
reached Florence as well as Venice by 1450, where Mantegna 
would have encountered them. 

Mantegna’s patron for the St. Sebastian is unknown, but as a 
court painter, he served the marquis of Mantua. For the marquis’ 
palace in Mantua, he painted a room that has come to be called the 
Camera Picta , or painted room (fig. 15.49). This was a multipur¬ 
pose vaulted room—sometimes bedroom, sometimes reception 
hall—which Mantegna finished in 1474. On the walls he painted 
portraits of the Gonzaga family, their retainers, their children, and 
their possessions. The room celebrates the marquis’s brilliant 
court, his dynastic accomplishments, and his wealth, in a witty 
display that became an attraction for visiting humanists, politi¬ 
cians, artists, and princes. In such ways, princes used art to 
improve their social and political positions. The Camera Picta also 
celebrates Mantegna’s skill and brought him fame among his 
contemporaries. 

Mantegna used the actual architecture of the room—the 
corbels supporting the vaults, the mantel over the fireplace—to 
create an illusionistic glimpse of the Gonzaga family at home. 
Trompe-l’oeil pilasters serve as window frames through which a 
viewer sees members of the family out-of-doors; the figures of 
Ludovico and his son Francesco, recently made a cardinal, are 
observed by servants with a horse and dogs on the other side of 
the main door. In addition to the specific features of the people 
and the naturalism of the details, Mantegna’s mastery of perspec¬ 
tive allows him to connect the painted world to the real world of 
the spectator. The centerpiece of this illusion occurs at the crown 
of the vault (fig. 15.50), where Mantegna paints a fictive oculus 
through which a spectator sees the sky. Framing this window is a 
foreshortened balustrade on which little putti (small boys) climb 
and over which court ladies peer. Mantegna uses many devices to 
create illusions in this room, including drapery that appears to be

fluttering in the outside breeze and trompe Poeil reliefs of Roman 
emperors on the vaults. Above the mantel, Ludovico appears 
again, this time in a more formal setting, surrounded by family 
and courtiers. The brilliance of the court is wonderfully captured 
by Mantegna s splendid paintings. 


Venice 

While it extended control over its neighbors, Venice maintained a 
stable republican government throughout the fifteenth century. 
Protected from outsiders by its lagoon, it was ruled by a merchant 
aristocracy so firmly established that there was little internal 
conflict and the Doges Palace (see fig. 13.32) could forgo any 
fortifications. Similarly, the houses of Venetian patricians were 
not required to serve as fortresses, with the result that they devel¬ 
oped into graceful, ornate structures. The Ca’ d’Oro (fig. 15.51) 
was built beginning in 1421 for Marino Contarini, whose family 
had long prospered from trade. To assert his status, Contarini 
spared no expense on his dwelling on the Grand Canal. It received 
its name (“house of gold”) from the lavish gold leaf that once 
adorned the facade. 

The design in part reflects the different functions of the 
building. The ground floor was used as a shipping center and 
warehouse, while the second story is devoted mainly to a large 
reception hall, with several smaller rooms to the right. Private 
quarters are found mainly on the upper floor. The intersecting 
ribs of arches form a delicate latticework on the facade, which 
combine with the brilliant colors and the use of gold to express 
the family’s wealth, position, and ambition.

ECHOES OF DONATELLO’S CATTAMELATA Local 
Venetian traditions gave way slowly to the revival of interest in 
ancient art coming from Florence. Several Florentine artists, 
including Donatello and Andrea del Castagno, were called to 
Venice to execute important commissions. Flemish painting 
was admired and collected in Venice, which as a center for 
international trade housed colonies of merchants from northern 
Europe. By the end of the century, Venice had also adopted the 
new techniques and references to ancient art as useful tools for 
expressing itself. A good example of this is the commission given 
by the republic to Verrocchio to execute a large bronze equestrian 
statue commemorating a Venetian army commander, the condot- 
tiere Bartolommeo Colleoni (fig. 15.52). Colleoni had requested 
such a statue in his will, in which he also left a large fortune to the 
city-state. Colleoni obviously knew the Gattamelata statue (see 
fig. 15.14) by Donatello, and wanted the same honor for himself. 
Verrocchio likely viewed Donatello s work as the model for his 
statue, yet he did more than simply imitate it, bringing his 
painter s skills to the rendering of the textures and details of the 
monument. 

Colleoni s horse is graceful and spirited; its thin hide reveals 
veins, muscles, and sinews, in contrast to the rigid surfaces of the 
armored figure bestriding it. Since the horse is also smaller in 


550 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 





































relation to its rider than in the Gattamelata statue, Colleoni looms 
in the saddle as the very image of forceful dominance. Legs 
straight, one shoulder thrust forward, he surveys the scene before 
him with the same concentration we saw in Donatello s St. George 
(see fig. 15.12). Like Donatellos work, the Colleoni statue 
reminds a viewer of the contributions its subject made to his city. 

BELLINI AND OIL PAINTING In addition to the revival of 
Roman forms, the traditions of Venice were further enhanced late 
in the fifteenth century by an exploration of the new medium of 
oil painting. A crucial intermediary in introducing this technique 
to Venice was probably Antonello da Messina, a painter from 
southern Italy who may have traveled to Flanders to learn it; he is 
documented in Venice in the 1470s. In the work of Giovanni 
Bellini (ca. 1430-1507), Mantegna s brother-in-law and a member 
of a family of painters, the technique of painting in oil pioneered 


by the Flemish is combined with Florentine spatial systems and 
Venetian light and color. 

Bellini s St. Francis in the Desert (fig. 15.53), dating from about 
1480, displays the artists synthesis of these elements to create a 
wholly original image. In this painting, St. Francis has just 
stepped out of his hermit s cell, fitted out with a desk under an 
arbor. He has left his wooden sandals behind and looks up ecstat¬ 
ically to the sky. Some scholars believe the painting shows Francis 
receiving the stigmata (the wounds of Christ) on the Feast of the 
Holy Cross in 1224, when a crucified seraph reportedly appeared 
to him on Mount La Verna, in Tuscany. Others have argued that 
the scene “illustrates” the Hymn of the Sun , which Francis com¬ 
posed the next year, after his annual fast at a hermitage near his 
hometown of Assisi. Whichever narrative moment is depicted, the 
painting expresses Franciscan ideals. For St. Francis, “Brother 
Sun, who gives the day...and...is beautiful and radiant with great

splendor,” was a symbol of the Lord. What he sees in the painting 
is not the sun itself, which is obscured by a cloud, but God 
revealed as the light divine. This miraculous light is so intense that 
it illuminates the entire scene. 

In the background is a magnificent expanse of Italian country¬ 
side. St. Francis is so small compared to the landscape setting that 
he seems almost incidental. Yet his mystic rapture before the 
beauty of the visible world guides a viewer s response to the vista, 
which is ample and intimate at the same time. St. Francis believed 
that God created nature for the benefit of humanity Bellini uses 
the tools of the Renaissance artist to re-create a vision of natural 
beauty. In this deep space, derived using the rules of perspective, 
he depicts detailed textures and forms to populate the landscape. 
Some of these forms may express Franciscan values. For Francis, 
the road to salvation lay in the ascetic life of the hermit, symbol¬ 
ized by the cave. The donkey may stand for St. Francis himself, 
who referred to his body as Brother Ass, which must be 
disciplined. The other animals—heron, bittern, and rabbit—are, 


like monks, solitary creatures in Christian lore. Yet Bellini s soft 
colors and glowing light infuse the painting with a warmth that 
makes such a solitary life not only bearable, but enviable. 

As the foremost artist of Venice, Bellini produced a number of 
altarpieces of the sacra conversazione type. The last known and most 
monumental is the Madonna and Saints (fig. 15.54), done in 1505 
for the Benedictine convent of San Zaccaria. Here, the Queen of 
Heaven is raised up on a throne with her Child, while SS. Peter, 
Catherine, Lucy, and Jerome stand before her. The placement of 
the female saints may reflect the interests of the nuns for whom 
the altarpiece was made. (When the painting was fitted with its 
present frame a decade later, it was cut at the sides, and a piece, 
since removed, was added at the top.) Compared with Domenico 
Veneziano s sacra conversazione of 60 years earlier (see fig. 15.30), 
the setting is simpler but even more impressive. Instead of a 
Gothic canopy, the saints are gathered below a semidome covered 
with mosaic in the Venetian medieval tradition (see fig. 8.47). It is 
as if the celestial assembly is taking place in Venice itself. Bellini s 


552 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 








































figures are comfortably inserted into the apse in a stable pyramid 
composition. The structure is obviously not a real church, for its 
sides are open and the scene is flooded with sunlight. 

What distinguishes this altar from earlier Florentine examples 
is not only the spaciousness of the design but its calm, meditative 
mood. Here, the figures seem isolated and deep in thought. The 
silence is enhanced by the way the artist has bathed the scene in a 
delicate haze. There are no harsh contrasts. Light and shadow 
blend in almost imperceptible gradations, and colors glow with a 
new richness. Bellini creates a glimpse of a heavenly court peopled 
by ideal figures in an ideal space. 

Rome and the Papal States 

Long neglected during the papal exile in Avignon (see page 469), 
Rome once more became a major artistic center in the late 
fifteenth century. As the papacy regained power on Italian soil, 
the popes began to beautify both the Vatican and the surrounding 
city. They also reasserted their power as temporal lords over 
Rome and the Papal States. These popes believed that the monu¬ 
ments of Christian Rome should outshine those of the pagan past. 
To achieve this goal, they called many artists from Florence and 
the surrounding areas to Rome in the fifteenth century, including 
Leon Battista Alberti, Gentile da Fabriano, Masaccio, Fra 
Angelico, Piero della Francesca, and Sandro Botticelli. Like the 


other courts of Italy, the papacy saw the value of spending money 
on adorning both ecclesiastical and domestic structures. 

THE SISTINE CHAPEL Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere (r. 1471 — 
1484) sponsored several important projects in the last quarter of 
the century. One of these was the building at the Vatican of a new 
chapel for the pope, called the Sistine Chapel after Sixtus IV. 
Around 1481-82, Sixtus commissioned a cycle of frescoes for the 
walls of the chapel depicting events from the life of Moses (on the 
left wall) and Christ (on the right wall), representing the Hebrew 
Bible and New Testament. To execute them, he hired most of 
the key painters from central Italy, among them Botticelli, 
Ghirlandaio, and Pietro Vanucci, called Perugino (ca. 1450-1523). 
Born near Perugia in Umbria (the region southeast of Tuscany), 
Perugino maintained close ties with Florence. He completed the 
Sistine Chapel fresco The Delivery ofthe Keys (fig. 15.55) in 1482. 

The gravely symmetrical design conveys the special impor¬ 
tance of the subject in this particular setting: The authority of St. 
Peter as the first pope, as well as of all those who followed him, 
rests on his having received the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven 
from Christ himself. The figures have the crackling drapery and 
idealized features of Verrocchio (see fig. 15.20) in whose work¬ 
shop Perugino spent some time. Along with the other apostles, a 
number of bystanders with highly individualized features witness 
the solemn event.

In the vast expanse of the background, two further narratives 
appear: To the left, in the middle distance, is the story of the 
tribute money; to the right, the attempted stoning of Christ. The 
inscriptions on the two Roman triumphal arches (modeled on 
the Arch of Constantine; see fig. 7.70) favorably compare Sixtus 
IV to Solomon, who built the Temple of Jerusalem. These arches 
flank a domed structure seemingly inspired by the ideal church 
of Alberti’s Treatise on Architecture. Also Albertian is the math¬ 
ematically exact perspective, which lends the view its spatial 
clarity. The symmetry and clear space of the image express the 
character of the rule of Sixtus IV, not only in spiritual but also in 
temporal terms. 

SIGNORELLI AND THE CHAPEL OF SAN BRIZIO Sixtus’s 
claims over the Papal States were taken up by his successor, 
Alexander VI, who pursued temporal power with armies as well 
as spiritual weapons. Such activities drew the censure of other 
Christians, both in Italy and elsewhere, fueling the anticlerical 
feelings of the next century The city of Orvieto in Umbria had 
shown great allegiance to the papacy, and in return, the pope 
adorned the chapel of San Brizio in the city’s cathedral with 
a series of frescoes beginning in 1499. The commission for the 
project went to Luca Signorelli (1445/50-1523), a Tuscan painter 
who had studied with Piero della Francesca. The theme chosen 
for the frescoes is the end of the world, as predicted in the book 
of Revelation, and further elaborated by St. Augustine, Thomas 
Aquinas, and Dante, as well as the fifteenth-century Dominican 
preacher Vincent Ferrer. One of the most memorable of these 
frescoes is The Damned Cast into Hell (fig. 15.56). Signorelli 


envisions the scene as a mass of bodies pressed forcefully down¬ 
ward to be tormented by devils and licked by the flames of Hell, 
while the archangel Michael oversees the punishment. Inspired by 
the muscular forms of Pollaiuolo, Signorelli uses the nude body as 
an expressive instrument: The damned twist and turn, their 
bodies expressing the torments they face. The chaotic compos¬ 
ition and compressed space contrasts strikingly with the rational 
calm of Perugino’s The Delivery of the Keys (see fig. 15.55). 
Signorelli’s frightening image of the end of time was painted as the 
year 1500 approached, a date which many believed would signal 
the end of days. 

The late 1490s were a time of great uncertainty in Italy The 
Medici were expelled from Florence; the French invaded in 1494; 
the plague returned to ravage cities; and the Turks continued their 
incursions into Europe. (The Turks had crushed the Christian 
forces at Lepanto, Greece, in 1499, a defeat that would be avenged 
in a second, more famous battle at the same site in 1571.) Fears 
that the “end of days” were coming were fanned by the sermons 
of Savonarola and other preachers. 

By this time, however, the artists and patrons of Italy lived in 
a much different world. Despite Savonarola’s charges of “pagan¬ 
ism” in late fifteenth-century Italy, the revival of ancient thought 
and art was there to stay Under the influence of the ancients and 
their humanist contemporaries, the artists of Renaissance Italy 
had transformed the look and design of buildings, the scale and 
significance of sculpture, and the forms and techniques of paint¬ 
ing. They developed new means to render the world in their 
images, using perspective and naturalism, and created works of art 
that united ancient forms with contemporary content.

The High Renaissance in Italy, 

1495-1520 


<j) 


L ooking back at the artists of the fifteenth century, the 

artist and art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote in 1550, “Truly great was 
the advancement conferred on the arts of architecture, painting, and 
sculpture by those excellent masters. ” From Vasari’s perspective, the earlier 
generation had provided the groundwork that enabled sixteenth-century artists to 


“surpass the age of the ancients.” Later artists and critics agreed 
with Vasari s judgment that the artists who worked in the decades 
just before and after 1500 attained a perfection in their art worthy 
of admiration and emulation. 

For Vasari, the artists of this generation were paragons of their 
profession. Following Vasari, artists and art teachers of subse¬ 
quent centuries have used the works of this 25-year period 
between 1495 and 1520, known as the High Renaissance, as a 
benchmark against which to measure their own. Yet the idea of a 
“High” Renaissance presupposes that it follows something 
“lower,” which seems an odd way to characterize the Italian art of 
the inventive and dynamic fifteenth century. For this and other 
reasons, this terminology has been reconsidered in the past few 
decades. Nonetheless, however we label it, this brief period saw 
the creation of what are still some of the most revered works of 
European art. These were created by the most celebrated names in 
the history of art, as chronicled in Vasari s The Lives of the Most 
Eminent Painters , Sculptors and Architects of Italy. Vasaris book 
placed the biography of the artist at the center of the study of art, 
and his Lives became a model for art-historical writing. Indeed, 
the celebrity of artists is a distinctive characteristic of the early 
sixteenth century. 

Detail of figure 16.32, Titian, Madonna with Members of 
the Pesaro Family 


Leonardo, Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giorgione, and 
Titian were all sought after in early sixteenth-century Italy, and 
the two who lived beyond 1520, Michelangelo and Titian, were 
internationally celebrated during their lifetimes. This fame was 
part of a wholesale change in the status of artists that had been 
occurring gradually during the course of the fifteenth century and 
which gained strength with these artists. Despite the qualities of 
their births, or the differences in their styles and personalities, 
these artists were given the respect due to intellectuals and 
humanists. Their social status was on a par with members of the 
great royal courts. In some cases, they were called “genius” or 
“divine. ” Some among them were raised to the nobility. 

Part of this cult of fame was owed to the patrons who com¬ 
missioned this small number of gifted and ambitious men to make 
works of art for them. This period saw the coming together of 
demanding patrons—rulers, popes, princes—and innovative artists. 
Patrons competed for works by these artists and in so doing set the 
artists into competition with each other; this pattern had already 
begun in early fifteenth-century Florence. The artists tested their 
skills against each other to inspire them to produce innovations in 
technique and in expression. The prestige of their patrons con¬ 
tributed to the mystique that developed around the artists, even as 
the reputations of the artists enriched the prestige of the patrons. 

What is truly remarkable about this group of artists is their 
mastery of technique in their chosen mediums and in their styles 
of expression. Each of these artists developed a distinctive visual

CHAPTER 




style that grew out of the ideas of the fifteenth century, but which, 
through their personal vision, their awareness of intellectual trends, 
and their hard work, gave rise to works of art that their contem¬ 
poraries claimed surpassed both nature and the ancients. Their 
pictorial works share certain features: an approach to the imitation 
of nature that idealizes forms even as they are rendered to replicate 
nature; understanding of and reliance on the forms of antiquity; 
balance and clarity in their compositions; and emotional power. 

Also remarkable is that works of such authority and harmony 
were produced during a quarter-century of crisis and instability. 
During this period, Italy was threatened by the Turkish expansion 
from Istanbul, invaded by the French, and torn apart by internal 
wars. Florence saw the exile of the Medici, the rise of Girolamo 
Savonarola, the establishment of a republic, and the return of the 
Medici. Venice saw its territories stripped away by its rivals. 
Milan was ruled by a despot, then conquered by the French. The 
papacy began a program of territorial reclamation and expansion 
that brought it into conflict with its neighbors; the Roman 
Church also had to contend with the shock of a theological 
challenge offered by Martin Luther s critique of Catholic dogma 
and practice. All of Europe was astonished by reports of new 


lands and new peoples across the ocean, which challenged their 
notion of the world itself. 

THE HIGH RENAISSANCE IN 
FLORENCE AND MILAN 

Florence s reputation as a center for the arts made it a magnet for 
artists and patrons as the fifteenth century came to a close. The 
brilliance of the court around Lorenzo de’ Medici came to an end 
with his death in 1492 and the subsequent failure of his son as the 
leader of the city. Many Florentines heeded the warnings of the 
preacher Girolamo Savonarola, who encouraged them to reform 
their faith and their lives; in response, they rejected the worldly 
culture of the Medici court. Under his influence, “pagan” texts 
and works of art were burned in bonfires in the Piazza della 
Signoria; the painter Sandro Botticelli destroyed several of his 
paintings at these bonfires. Yet the penitential furor that 
Savonarola urged did not outlive the preachers execution in 1498. 
Florence restored its republican form of government, which 
lasted only until the next generation of Medici politicians took

back the reins of government in 1512. The political ferment seems 
to have inspired tremendous artistic innovation, as witnessed in 
the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarotti. 

Leonardo da Vinci in Florence 

Leonardo da Vinci was at once a scientist, painter, sculptor, 
musician, architect, and engineer. Born the son of a notary in the 
little Tuscan town of Vinci in 1452, Leonardo trained as a painter 
in Florence in Verrocchio s busy workshop. He left Florence 
around 1482 to work for Ludovico Sforza, the duke of Milan, pri¬ 
marily as a military engineer and only secondarily as an artist. 
On Sforzas removal by the French in 1499, Leonardo made his 
way to Venice, Rome, and Florence, where he executed several 
commissions between 1503 and 1505. From 1506 through 1516 he 
worked in Rome and Florence and again in Milan, whose French 
overlord, Francis I, invited him to retire to a chateau in the Loire 
Valley. Leonardo died there in 1519. 

During his twenties, as a student and then assistant in the 
workshop, Leonardo collaborated with his teacher Verrocchio 
before taking commissions on his own. Several works from this 
period remained unfinished, but one that he completed is the 
Portrait of Ginevra de’ Bend , usually dated between 1474 and 
1478 (fig. 16.1). Vasari described this painting in his Life of 
Leonardo, and most authorities recognize it as an early work by 
his hand. 

The sitter s identity is known, both from what Vasari says and 
elements of the painting itself. The young woman stands before a 
thick hedge of juniper, which is a pun on her name (juniper is 
ginepro in Italian); it is also a symbol of chastity. The reverse of 
this panel depicts another sprig of juniper and a painted scroll that 
says, “She adorns her beauty with virtue.” The portrait was cut 
down in size at some point in its history, and it likely originally 
included the sitter s hands, in an arrangement much like that of 
the marble Lady with Flowers by Verrocchio (see fig. 15.42). 
Among the Florentine elite, Ginevra de’ Benci was a celebrated 
beauty and a poet, though little of her poetry survives. She was 
married in 1474, and this may be the reason for the commission of 
the portrait. 

Marriage or betrothal occasioned the painting of portraits of 
women, usually setting them in interiors, wearing expensive jew¬ 
elry and garments, and often in profile arrangements. Leonardo 
breaks this mold, by setting the young woman (she was 16 when 
she married) out of doors in an atmospheric landscape and in a 
three-quarter view. Flemish portraits (see fig. 14.21) that had 
made their way to Florence probably inspired these choices. 
Flemish works definitely informed Leonardo s use of oil as the 
medium for his paintings. Other artists in late fifteenth-century 
Florence adopted these same elements, including Domenico 
Ghirlandaio (see fig. 15.41). What is extraordinary here is what 
these tools achieve in Leonardos hands. As in Ghirlandaios 
lovely portrait of an old man, we see the three-quarter pose, 
brilliant color, and a view of a landscape. Both artists use atmos¬ 
pheric perspective to suggest the lack of local color in the distant 


landscape, but Leonardo s landscape is much more believable and 
humid-looking. He exploits the oil technique here to blend his 
brushstrokes very subtly so as to diminish the appearance of 
contour lines. His figures seem to exist only as the result of light 
falling on three-dimensional objects. This method of modeling is 
called chiaroscuro, the Italian word for “light and dark. ” Starting 
from a middle tone laid all over the panel, Leonardo renders deep 
shadows and bright highlights for his forms. Instead of standing 
side by side in a vacuum, forms share in a new pictorial unity cre¬ 
ated by the softening of contours in an envelope of atmosphere. 
These early experiments in the oil medium and the intelligence 
he gives to his sitter point to directions his art would take in 
the future. 

Leonardo in Milan 

Leaving behind several incomplete commissions, Leonardo left 
Florence for Milan in 1481, where he entered the employ of 
Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan. He stayed there until 1499, 
working as an engineer, court artist, and military designer. As had 
Brunelleschi before him, Leonardo turned to analysis and 
research to solve a variety of problems, both artistic and scientific. 
He believed the world to be intelligible through mathematics, 
which formed the basis for his investigations. Thus, the artist 
must know not only the rules of perspective, but all the laws of 
nature. To him, the eye was the perfect means of gaining such 
knowledge. The extraordinary range of his inquiries can be seen 
in the hundreds of drawings and notes that he made and hoped 
one day to turn into an encyclopedic set of treatises. He was fas¬ 
cinated by all elements of nature: animals, water, anatomy, and the 
workings of the mind. How original he was as a scientist is still a 
matter of debate, but he pioneered modern scientific illustration, 
an essential tool for anatomists and biologists. His drawings, such 
as the Embryo in the Womb (fig. 16.2), combine his own vivid 
observations with the analytic clarity of diagrams—or, to para¬ 
phrase Leonardo himself, sight and insight. The sheet of studies 
shown here is a product of his skill at rendering what he saw, and 
of his dispassionate recording of details both in visual terms and 
in his notes, written backward in mirror-writing. 

Like other fifteenth-century scholars, he read ancient author¬ 
ities to assist his inquiries. To prepare himself for human dissec¬ 
tions, Leonardo read the works of the Greek physician Galen. His 
interest in architecture and engineering led him to the works of 
the Roman architect Vitruvius, whose treatise had inspired 
Alberti earlier in the century. A drawing from the late 1480s (fig. 
16.3) visualizes Vitruvius’ notion that the human body may be 
used to derive the perfect geometrical forms of the circle and the 
square. This is a powerful image of the value that humanists and 
architects placed on these geometric elements, as carriers of pro¬ 
found meaning as well as visual forms. Like other humanists, 
Leonardo was interested in the place of man in the world. 

His patrons consulted with Leonardo on several sorts of 
building and engineering projects. He seems, however, to have 
been less concerned with actual building than with tackling

theoretical problems of structure and design. The many architec¬ 
tural projects still to be seen in his notebooks were intended to 
remain on paper. Yet these sketches, especially those of his 
Milanese period, reveal Leonardo s probing of the design prob¬ 
lems faced by his forebears Brunelleschi and Alberti, as well as by 
his contemporaries. The domed central-plan churches of the type 
shown in figure 16.4 hold particular interest to architectural 


history. In this drawing, Leonardo imagines a union of circle and 
square, controlled by proportion, and articulated by classical 
orders. In conception, this design stands halfway between the 
dome of Florence cathedral and the most ambitious structure of 
the sixteenth century, the new basilica of St. Peter s in Rome. 

Soon after arriving in Milan, Leonardo began painting The 
Virgin of the Rocks (fig. 16.5) for a confraternity (lay brotherhood)

dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, which maintained a 
chapel in San Francesco Grande in Milan. (Completion of the 
project was delayed because it became the subject of a dispute 
with the patrons.) The subject—the infant St. John adoring Jesus 
in the presence of the Virgin—enjoyed a certain popularity in 
Florence in the late fifteenth century. Speculation on the early life 
of Jesus and his cousin, the Baptist, led to stories about their 
meeting as children. Franciscan preachers encouraged believers to 
meditate on the “human” side of Jesus’ life and stories like this 
were the result. Such tales report the young Baptist spending his 
life as a hermit; because of this, artists represented him wearing a 
hair shirt. Leonardo imagines this meeting almost as a vision of 
Christ appearing to the infant Baptist in the wilderness. The 
young Baptist kneels on the left and looks toward Jesus, who 
blesses him. The Virgin Mary is the link between the two boys, as 
she protectively reaches for the Baptist with one hand and holds 
the other open-palmed over her son. An angel with a billowing 
red cloak steadies Jesus and points toward the Baptist, while look¬ 
ing out at the viewer. 


The scene is mysterious in many ways. The secluded rocky 
setting, the pool in the foreground, and the carefully rendered 
plant life suggest symbolic meanings, but scholars are still debat¬ 
ing the details. The figures emerge from the semidarkness of the 
grotto, enveloped in a moist atmosphere that delicately veils their 
forms. This fine haze, called sfumato (smokiness), lends an 
unusual warmth and intimacy to the scene. The light draws atten¬ 
tion to the finely realized bodies of the children and the beautiful 
heads of the Virgin and the angel. Leonardo arranges the figures 
into a pyramid of form, with the figures establishing a solid geo¬ 
metric shape in space which has the Virgin s head at the apex. As 
a result, the composition is stable and balanced, but the gestures 
lead the eye back and forth to suggest the relationships among the 
figures. The selective light, quiet mood, and tender gestures create 
a remote, dreamlike quality, and make the picture seem a poetic 
vision rather than an image of reality. 

Leonardo had much to say about the relationship between 
poetry and painting. He thought sight was the superior sense and 
that painters were better equipped to represent what the eye could

see or imagine. His notebooks include many comments on the 
paragone , or comparison, between painting and poetry. This 
competition between art forms was rooted in the Roman poet 
Horace s statement that poetry is like painting (“ut pictura poe- 
sis ”), which artists of the High Renaissance reinterpreted to mean 
that painting and poetry seek similar effects. (See Trimary Source , 
page 562.) Leonardo s musings on the rivalry between poetry and 
painting extended to that between painting and sculpture. He 
argued that painting was superior to sculpture primarily because 
it provided the possibility for creating the sort of illusionary 
spaces and textures seen in The Virgin of the Rocks. Additionally, 
the painter could dress elegantly for his work, and not subject 
himself to the clouds of dust or the brute force needed to make 
sculpture. Not all of his contemporaries agreed. Michelangelo, for 
one, defended the art of sculpture as superior to painting, 
precisely because it created fully three-dimensional forms while 
painting merely created illusions. 

Leonardo s skill at creating such illusions and his experimen¬ 
tal approach to achieving them is apparent in The Last Supper (fig. 
16.6), executed between 1495 and 1498. Leonardo s patron, Duke 
Ludovico, commissioned him to decorate the refectory (dining 
hall) of the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, 
which housed the dukes family chapel. The resulting painting 
became instantly famous and was copied numerous times by 
other artists, but a modern viewer can only imagine its original 


splendor, despite the painting s recent restoration. Dissatisfied 
with the limitations of the traditional fresco technique, Leonardo 
experimented with an oil-tempera medium on dry plaster that did 
not adhere well to the wall in the humidity of Milan. What is 
more, the quality of the painting has been diminished by renova¬ 
tions and damage done to the wall. Yet what remains is more than 
adequate to account for its tremendous impact. 

The theme of the Last Supper was conventional for monastic 
refectories, as a comparison with Castagno s The Last Supper (see 
fig. 15.29), painted half a century before, reveals. Monks or nuns 
dined in silence before images of the apostles and Christ at table. 
Like Castagno, Leonardo creates a spatial setting that seems like 
an annex to the real interior of the room, though deeper and more 
atmospheric than the earlier fresco. The central vanishing point of 
the perspective system is located behind the head of Jesus in the 
exact middle of the fresco; it thus becomes charged with symbolic 
significance. Equally symbolic is the opening in the wall behind 
Jesus: It acts as the architectural equivalent of a halo. Rather than 
Castagno s explosion of marble veining or an artificial disk of 
gold, Leonardo lets natural light enframe Jesus. All elements of 
the picture—light, composition, colors, setting—focus the atten¬ 
tion on Jesus. 

He has presumably just spoken the fateful words, “One of 
you shall betray me. ” The disciples ask, “Lord, is it I? ” The apos¬ 
tles who flank Jesus do not merely react to these words. Rather,

each reveals his own personality, his own relationship to Jesus. In 
the group to his right, Peter impulsively grabs a knife; next to him 
John seems lost in thought; and Judas (the figure leaning on 
the table in the group to Jesus 5 right) recoils from Jesus into 
shadow Leonardo has carefully calculated each pose and expres¬ 
sion so that the drama unfolds across the picture plane. The 
figures exemplify what the artist wrote in one of his notebooks— 
that the highest and most difficult aim of painting is to depict “the 
intention of mans soul” through gestures and movements of 
the limbs. 

But to view this scene as just one moment in a psychological 
drama does not do justice to Leonardo s aims, which went well 
beyond a literal rendering of the biblical narrative. He clearly 
wanted to condense his subject, both physically (by the compact, 
monumental grouping of the figures) and spiritually (by presenting 


many levels of meaning at one time). Thus, Jesus 5 gesture is one 
both of submission to the divine will and of offering. His calm 
presence at the center of the table suggests that, in addition to the 
drama of the announcement, Jesus also institutes the Eucharist, in 
which bread and wine become his body and blood. Such multiple 
meanings would serve as spiritual food for the Dominican friars 
who lived in the presence of this image. 

Leonardo Back in Florence and Elsewhere 

In 1499, the duchy of Milan fell to the French, so Leonardo 
returned to Florence after brief trips to Mantua and Venice. He 
must have found the political climate very different from what he 
remembered. Florentines had become unhappy with the rule of 
Lorenzo de 5 Medicis son, Piero, and had expelled the Medici; 


564 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 







until their return in 1512, the city was a republic again. For a 
while, Leonardo seems to have been active mainly as an engineer 
and surveyor. Then, in 1503, the city commissioned him to do a 
mural for the council chamber of the Palazzo della Signoria, 
which he abandoned in 1506 and returned to Milan. 

TH E MONA LISA While working on the mural, Leonardo also 
painted the portrait of a woman, whom Vasari identified as Lisa 
Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, the so-called Mona 
Lisa (fig. 16.7). (Because of her husband’s name, the French call 
her “La Giocanda.”) Much recent research has tended to confirm 
this identity. If it is indeed the Lady Lisa (Mona is a contraction 
of Madonna), who married in 1495 at age 16, she was about 25 
when the portrait was made. For reasons that are now unclear, 
Leonardo kept this painting, possibly continuing to work on it. 
After his death in France, the portrait entered the collection of 
King Francis I. From the royal collection, it became a key posses¬ 
sion of the Musee du Louvre. To some extent its fame is a 
product of its ownership. 

But the Mona Lisa is also famous for its formal qualities. We 
may be able to see them more clearly in comparison to his earlier 
portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci (see fig. 16.1). Both paintings break 
with the fifteenth-century tradition of depicting young women in 
profile. Leonardo depicts both of these young women in three- 
quarter poses against landscape backgrounds. He also depicts the 
women in simple garments, without the jewels and brocades that 
adorned most brides, to concentrate on their features. As he had 
originally done with Ginevra, Leonardo represents Mona Lisa at 
half-length, so that her hands are included in the image. The 
whole composition thus forms a stable pyramid. Compared to 
Ginevra, however, Mona Lisa seems a creature of a different 
order. Leonardo renders the subtle movement of light washing 
over her figure to draw attention to her features. Having mastered 
the oil technique, he builds the forms from layers of glazes so thin 
that the panel appears to glow with a gentle light from within, 
despite the dirty varnish that now obscures the painting. Mona 
Lisa sits before an evocative landscape, whose mountainous ele¬ 
ments emerge from a cool sfumato backdrop, while the rivers and 
bridges winding through it echo the highlights on her drapery; the 
landscape envelops her, where for Ginevra it seems a mere back¬ 
drop. The beautifully observed details of Mona Lisa’s high brow 
and crossed hands give her as much character as her famous smile. 
Vasari helped to spread the fame of the painting, for he claimed 
the portrait exemplified “how faithfully art can imitate nature.” 
(See www.myartslab.com. ) This skill, for Vasari, was the root of 
Leonardos genius. For later generations, the Mona Lisa has 
served as the consummate example of his art. 

ROME RESURGENT 

By the end of the fifteenth century, the papacy had firmly reestab¬ 
lished itself in Rome. Along with their spiritual control of the 
Church, the popes reasserted political and military control over 


the Papal States in the area around Rome. Rebuilding the city was 
an expression of the papal intentions to rule there, as Sixtus IV 
had demonstrated with his building of the Sistine Chapel, among 
other projects. Alexander VI, who became pope in 1492, used his 
papacy to enlarge papal domains through the marriages of his 
daughter, Lucrezia Borgia, and through the military exploits 
undertaken by his son Cesare Borgia. He also made the papal 
court the peer of any princely court in Italy. On Alexanders 
death, the new pope Julius II (r. 1503-1513) made his aim the 
physical renewal of Rome, hoping that it would rival the glory of 
the ancient city. He invested vast sums in large-scale projects 
involving architecture, sculpture, and painting, and he called on 
numerous artists to work for him. The ancient citys Roman and 
medieval monuments inspired a variety of projects in the 
Renaissance city (map 16.1). Under Julius, Rome became the 
crucible of the High Renaissance. 

Bramante in Rome 

The most important architect in Julius’s Rome was Donato 
Bramante (1444-1514). A native of Urbino, he began his career as 
a fresco painter. Influenced by Piero della Francesca and Andrea 
Mantegna, Bramante became skilled at rendering architectural 
settings in correct perspective. Leonardo may also have had some 
influence on Bramante, as the two were colleagues at the court of 
Milan. Bramante s architectural works take Brunelleschi and 
Alberti as their main points of departure. 

After Milan fell to the French in 1499, Bramante went to 
Rome, where he experienced Roman buildings first hand. There, 
the Spanish-born pope Alexander VI had begun the process of 
enlarging and enhancing papal holdings, in which endeavor he 
had the support of the powerful Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand 
and Isabella. The Spanish rulers commissioned Bramante around 
1500 to build a structure to mark the supposed site of St. Peter’s 
crucifixion, attached to the church of San Pietro in Montorio (fig. 
16.8). Because of its powerful evocation of Roman circular tem¬ 
ples, it was called the Tempietto, or “little temple. ” This structure 
serves as a martyrium, a special chapel associated with a martyr. 

In early Christian Rome, such structures were often central¬ 
ized in plan. Bramante, however, seems as much inspired by the 
precepts of Alberti and the experiments of Leonardo as he is by 
the experience of Rome itself. A contemporary, Sebastiano Serlio, 
recorded Bramante s design in an architectural treatise that was 
published in the 1540s. According to this plan, Bramante intended 
to surround the Tempietto by a circular, colonnaded courtyard 
that would entirely respond to the structure. This conception was 
as bold and novel as the design of the chapel itself (fig. 16.9), for 
not only does the chapel’s colonnade dictate the courtyard’s 
colonnade, the walls of the courtyard open into concave niches 
that echo the facade of the chapel. 

This facade, with its three-step platform and use of the plain 
Tuscan Doric order, recalls Roman temple architecture more 
directly than does any fifteenth-century building (see fig. 7.23). 
Moreover, the entire design is based on the module of the

columns: For example, the distance between the columns is four 
times their diameter, and they are placed two diameters from the 
wall. This insistent logic follows the rules of temple design estab¬ 
lished by Vitruvius. Equally striking is Bramante s use of the 
“sculptured wall” in the Tempietto itself and the courtyard, as 
shown in the plan. Deeply recessed niches in the upper story are 
counterbalanced by the convex shape of the dome and by strongly 
projecting moldings and cornices. As a result, the Tempietto has 
a monumentality that belies its modest size. The building, includ¬ 
ing the sculptural decoration in the metopes and frieze around the 
base, is a brilliant example of papal propaganda. The Tempietto 
proclaims Christ and the popes (considered the successors of St. 
Peter) as the direct heirs of Rome. Bramante used the language of 
ancient Rome to express the claims of the modern pope. The pub¬ 
lication of the design by Serlio helped spread the specific elements

and the underlying design concepts of this building, and it became 
a very influential structure. 

Such work brought Bramante to the notice of Alexander Vis 
successor, Julius II. The nephew of Sixtus IV, Giuliano delle 
Rovere, as Pope Julius II, had great ambitions for the Church and 
for Rome. He used art and artists as tools in his goal of restoring 
papal authority over Christendom. This is nowhere more evident 
than in Juliuss decision to replace the Constantinian basilica of St. 
Peter’s (see fig. 8.8), which was in poor condition, with a church 
so magnificent that it would overshadow all the monuments of 
imperial Rome. He gave the commission to Bramante and laid the 
cornerstone for the project in 1506. Because of later changes, we 
know Bramante s original design mostly from a plan (fig. 16.10) 
and from the medal commemorating the start of the building 
campaign (fig. 16.11), which shows the exterior in general terms. 
These reveal the innovative approach that Bramante took in this 
project, which was grand both in scale and in conception.

The plan and commemorative medal indicate that Bramante 
envisioned a huge round dome, similar to the Pantheon’s, to 
crown the crossing of the barrel-vaulted arms of a Greek cross, 
that is, a cross with four arms the same length. Four lesser domes, 
each surmounting a chapel that echoes the main space, and tall 
corner towers were planned around the central dome. As Alberti 
prescribed and Leonardo proposed, Bramantes plan is based 
on the circle and the square. Not only had the ancients revered 
these perfect forms, Bramantes contemporaries saw them as 
appropriate symbols for the Christian empire that Julius planned. 
Bramante envisioned four identical facades dominated by classical 
forms: domes, half-domes, colonnades, and pediments. The 
principal dome would have been encircled by a colonnade as 
well. The whole facade would have been a unified, symmetrical 
sculptural form, united by proportion and the interplay of 
geometric elements. 

But this logical interlocking of forms would have been accom¬ 
panied by the structures huge scale, for Julius’s church was 
intended to be more than 500 feet long. Such a monumental 
undertaking required vast sums of money, and the construction of 
St. Peter’s progressed so slowly that in 1514, when Bramante died, 
only the four crossing piers had been built. For the next three 
decades the project was carried on by other architects, who 
altered his design in a number of ways. A new and decisive phase 
in the history of St. Peter’s began in 1546, when Michelangelo

OURCE 


Michelangelo Interprets the 
Vatican Pieta 



The Pieta for Cardinal Jean de Villiers de la Groslaye, now in St. Peter's, 
helped to establish Michelangelo 1 s reputation as a sculptor. In his Life of 
Michelangelo Buonarotti, first published in 1553, Michelangelo's friend 
and biographer, Ascanio Condivi, quotes the sculptor explaining 
features of the work. 

A little later on, the Cardinal of Saint-Denis ... commissioned him 
to make from one piece of marble that marvelous statue of Our 
Lady ... [she] is positioned seated on the rock, in which the cross was 
sunk, with her dead Son on her lap, and of such and so rare a beauty, 
that no one sees her without being inwardly moved to pity. An image 
truly worthy of the humanity which belongs properly to the Son of 
God and to such a mother; although there are some who make the 
reproach that the mother is shown as too young, in relation to her 
Son. But when I was discussing this with Michelangelo one day, he 
replied to me: "Don’t you know that chaste women remain far 
fresher than those who are not chaste? So much more the Virgin, in 
whom never has the least lascivious desire ever arisen that might alter 


her body. Moreover, let me add this, that besides such freshness and 
flower of youth being maintained in her in this natural way it may be 
believed to have been assisted by divine power to prove to the world 
the virginity and perpetual purity of the mother. This was not neces¬ 
sary in the Son; rather completely the opposite; because to show that, 
as He did, the Son of God took a truly human body, and was sub¬ 
jected to all that an ordinary man endures, except sin, there was no 
need for the divine to hold back the human, but to leave it to its order 
and course, so that the time of life He showed was exactly what it 
was. Consequently you are not to wonder if for these reasons I have 
made the most Holy Virgin, mother of God, far younger in compar¬ 
ison with her Son than her age would ordinarily require, and that I 
left the Son at his own age. ” 

This reflection would be worthy of any theologian. ... When he 
made this work, Michelangelo would have been 24 or 25 years old. 
He acquired great fame and reputation from this effort, and indeed it 
was already everyone’s opinion that he had not only surpassed all his 
contemporaries, and those who came before him, but that he also 
contended with the ancients.

took charge. It was then altered again in the seventeenth century. 
Nevertheless, Bramante s original plan for St. Peter’s was to put 
Roman imperial and Early Christian forms at the service of a 
Renaissance popes spiritual and temporal ambitions. 

Michelangelo in Rome and Florence 

Julius’s ambitions were also the spur for one of the crucial figures 
in the history of art, Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti 
Simoni (1475-1564). Acclaimed by his contemporaries, admired 
by his successors, and hailed as "divine” by Vasari, Michelangelo 
is one of the most influential and imitated artists in history. 
Gifted, driven, he has become the archetype of the genius, whose 
intellect and talents enabled him to work in many mediums; he 
was a sculptor, architect, painter, and poet. Pope Julius encour¬ 
aged him in his ambition to outdo the artists of antiquity, by 
giving him opportunities to produce some of his most inspired 
and famous works. 

Unlike Leonardo, for whom painting was the noblest of the 
arts because it embraced every visible aspect of the world, 
Michelangelo was a sculptor to the core. More specifically, he was 
a carver of marble statues. The limitations of sculpture, which 
Leonardo condemned as mechanical, unimaginative, and dirty, 
were virtues in Michelangelo’s eyes. Only the "liberation” of real, 
three-dimensional bodies from recalcitrant matter could satisfy 
Michelangelo. Painting, for him, should imitate the roundness of 
sculptured forms. Architecture, too, ought to share the organic 
qualities of the human figure. 

Michelangelo s belief in the human image as the supreme vehi¬ 
cle of artistic expression gave him a sense of kinship with ancient 


sculptors, more so than with other Renaissance practitioners. 
Among Italian masters, he nonetheless admired Giotto, Masaccio, 
and Donatello more than his contemporaries. Although his 
family came from the nobility, and therefore initially opposed his 
desire to become an artist, Michelangelo was apprenticed to 
Ghirlandaio, from whom he learned painting techniques. He 
came to the attention of Lorenzo de’ Medici, who invited him to 
study the antique statues in the garden of one of the Medici 
houses. The overseer of this collection, Bertoldo di Giovanni (ca. 
1420-1491), a pupil of Donatello, may have taught Michelangelo 
the rudiments of sculpture. From the beginning, however, 
Michelangelo was a carver rather than a modeler. He rarely 
worked in clay, except for sketches; he preferred harder materials, 
especially marble, which he shaped with his chisel. 

The young artist s mind was decisively shaped by the cultural 
climate of Florence during the 1480s and 1490s, even though the 
troubled times led him to flee the city for Rome in 1496. Lorenzo 
de 5 Medici’s death in 1492 put an end to the intellectual atmos¬ 
phere that he had fostered. The subsequent expulsion of the 
Medici, and the rise to power of the fiery preacher Girolamo 
Savonarola, brought calls for a spiritual awakening and a rejection 
of "paganism” and materialism. Both the Neo-Platonism of 
Marsilio Ficino and the religious reforms of Savonarola affected 
Michelangelo profoundly. Just as he conceived his statues as 
human bodies released from their marble prisons, so he saw the 
body as the earthly prison of the soul—noble perhaps, but a 
prison nonetheless. This dualism of body and spirit endows his 
figures with extraordinary pathos. Although outwardly calm, 
they seem stirred by an overwhelming psychic energy that finds 
no release in physical action.

PI ETA Having left Florence after the exile of the Medici, 
Michelangelo worked in Bologna and then Rome, where a French 
cardinal commissioned him in 1498 to carve a Pieta for his tomb 
chapel close to St. Peters (fig. 16.12). In the contract, 
Michelangelo promised to carve “the most beautiful work of 
marble in Rome. ” The subject of the Pieta was more familiar in 
northern Europe than in Italy, appearing in such works as the 
Roettgen Pieta (see fig. 12.60), although the theme of the Virgins 
lamentation for her dead son had appeared in works such as 
Giottos Arena Chapel frescoes (see fig. 13.20). Michelangelo, 
however, imagines the farewell between mother and son as a calm 
and transcendent moment rather than a tortured or hopeless one. 
The composition is stable; the over-large figure of the Virgin with 
her deeply carved robe easily supports the weight of her dead son. 

The Virgin seems far too young to be holding her grown son, 
so in addition to the Pieta, the image echoes the theme of the 


Madonna and Child. Michelangelo himself intended her youth to 
express her perpetual virginity, according to his friend and biog¬ 
rapher, Ascanio Condivi. (See Primary Source , page 568.) 
Michelangelo doesn’t merely tell a story, he offers viewers the 
opportunity to contemplate the central mystery of Christian 
faith—Christ as God in human form who sacrificed himself to 
redeem Original Sin—with the same serenity as Mary herself. 
When the Pieta was first displayed in 1499, some controversy sur¬ 
rounded its authorship; Michelangelo put it to rest by carving his 
name on the Virgin s sash. The inscription proudly asserts his 
authorship and his origin in Florence. At 24, his fame was assured. 

DAVID When this project was completed, Michelangelo 
returned to Florence, which had reestablished a republican form 
of government. There, in 1501, directors of the works for 
Florence cathedral commissioned him to execute a figure to be

installed on one of the buttresses of the facade. The 18-foot-high 
block of marble for this project had been partly carved by an 
earlier sculptor, but Michelangelo accepted the challenge to create 
something memorable from it. The result was the gigantic figure 
of the David (fig. 16.13). When it was completed in 1504, a 
committee of civic leaders and artists decided instead to put it in 
front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of the Florentine 
government. They placed a circlet of gilt bronze leaves around the 
statue s hips and put a gilt bronze wreath on David s head. The 
city of Florence claimed the figure as an emblem of its own repub¬ 
lican virtues. 

Michelangelo treated the biblical figure not as a victorious 
hero, but as the ever-vigilant guardian of the city. Unlike 
Donatello in his bronze David for the Medici (see fig. 15.33), 
Michelangelo omits the head of Goliath; instead David nervously 
fingers a slingshot, as his eyes focus on an opponent in the 
distance. Although both Donatello and Michelangelo rendered 
David as a nude, the style of the later sculpture proclaims an ideal 
very different from the wiry slenderness of Donatello s youth. 
Michelangelo had just spent several years in Rome, where he had 
been deeply impressed with the emotion-charged, muscular bod¬ 
ies of Hellenistic sculpture, which were being avidly collected 
there. (See The Art Historian's Lens , page 157.) Their heroic scale, 
their superhuman beauty and power, and the swelling volume of

their forms became part of Michelangelo s own style and, through 
him, of Renaissance art in general. In the David , Michelangelo 
competes with antiquity on equal terms and replaces its authority 
with his own. But instead of the emotionally wrought figures he 
saw in Hellenistic works, Michelangelo crafted the David to be at 
once calm and tense, active yet static, full of the potential for 
movement rather than its actual expression. 

Michelangelo in the Service of Pope Julius II 

The ambition to create powerful works of art is a hallmark of 
Michelangelo s career. It is seen again in the project he undertook 
for the Tomb of Julius II, planned for the new St. Peter s. The 
commission was given in 1505, but Julius interrupted it, then died 
in 1513, leaving the project incomplete. His heirs negotiated with 
Michelangelo over the next 30 years to produce a reduced version 
of the original plan. The initial plan, reconstructed in figure 16.14, 
combined sculpture and architecture into a grand statement of the 
glory of the pope. Juliuss sarcophagus was to sit at the apex of 


this architectural mass, intended in the first plan to enclose a 
burial chamber. 

On lower levels of the structure Michelangelo planned a figure 
of St. Paul and one of the Hebrew Bible hero, Moses (fig. 16.15). 
This figure was completed about ten years later. The Moses , meant 
to be seen from below, has the awesome force Vasari called terri- 
bilita —a concept similar to the “sublime” (see page 790). It strikes 
fear in a viewer from its sheer force. His pose, both watchful and 
meditative, suggests a man capable of wise leadership as well as 
towering wrath. Moses has just received the Ten Commandments, 
which he holds close to his massive torso. The horns, a traditional 
attribute based on a mistranslation of the Hebrew word for “ray” 
in the Vulgate (Latin Bible), which is also seen in Sluter s The Well 
of Moses (see fig. 14.1), signify the divine favor bestowed on 
Moses, whose face shone after he came down from Mount Sinai 
(Exodus 34). Michelangelo planned other figures for the project, 
including bound men, whose meaning is still obscure, as well as 
personifications of the active and contemplative life. Some of 
these, including the Moses , were assembled into the monument

for Julius installed in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, 
on a scale much reduced from the initial plan. 

One later figure for the tomb, the unfinished Awakening 
Prisoner (fig. 16.16), provides invaluable insights into 
Michelangelos artistic personality and working methods. For 


him, the making of a work of art was both joyous and painful, full 
of surprises, and not mechanical in any way. It appears that he 
started the process of carving a statue by trying to perceive a 
figure in the block as it came to him from the quarry. (At times he 
may even have visualized figures while picking out his material on 
the spot.) He may have believed that he could see “signs of life” 
within the marble—a knee or an elbow pressing against the 
surface. This attitude is expressed in one of his most famous 
sonnets, written around 1540: 

Not even the best of artists has any conception 
That a single marble block does not contain 
within its excess, and that is only attained 
by the hand that obeys the intellect.

Michelangelo (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1991), 
page 302 

To get a firmer grip on the dimly felt image that he believed 
was inside the stone, Michelangelo made numerous drawings, and 
sometimes small models in wax or clay, before daring to assault 
the marble itself. His practice was to draw the main view on the 
front of the block. Once he started carving, every stroke of the 
chisel would commit him more and more to a specific conception 
of the figure hidden in the block. The marble would permit him 
to free the figure only if his guess about its shape was correct. 
Sometimes the stone refused to give up some essential part of the 
figure within it, and he left the work unfinished. Michelangelo 
himself may have appreciated the expressive qualities of incom¬ 
plete works. Although he abandoned Awakening Prisoner for 
other reasons, every gesture seems to record the struggle for 
liberation of the figure. 

Pope Julius interrupted Michelangelo s work on the tomb at 
an early stage. The popes decision to enlarge St. Peters, a com¬ 
mission he gave to Bramante in 1506, altered his patronage prior¬ 
ities, and this so angered Michelangelo that he left Rome. Two 
years later, the pope half-forced, half-coaxed him to return to 
paint frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. 

FRESCOES FOR THE SISTINE CHAPEL CEILING The 

Sistine Chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, Julius’s uncle, 
who had it built and adorned between 1477 and 1482. Driven by 
his desire to resume work on the tomb, Michelangelo finished the 
ceiling in only four years, between May 1508 and November 1512 
(fig. 16.17). In this brief period of intense creation in a medium 
that he never felt was his own, Michelangelo produced a work of 
truly epochal importance. 

The ceiling is a shallow barrel vault interrupted over the 
windows by the triangular spandrels that support it. Michelangelo 
treated this surface as a single entity, with hundreds of figures 
distributed rhythmically within a painted architectural frame¬ 
work. Several different themes intersect throughout this complex 
structure (fig. 16.18). In the center, subdivided by ten illusionistic

transverse arches, are nine scenes from the book of Genesis, from 
the Creation of the World (at the altar end) to the Drunkenness 
of Noah (near the entry door); large figures of prophets and sibyls 
flank these narratives. In the triangular spandrels sit the ancestors 
of Christ, who also appear in the lunettes flanking the windows. 
Further narrative scenes occur at the corner pendentives, focusing 
on the Hebrew Bible heroes and prophets who prefigured Christ. 
Scholars are still debating the theological import of the whole 
program and whether Michelangelo consulted with advisors in 
the development of the themes. While the Creation and Fall 
of Man occur at the center of the ceiling, the prophets and ances¬ 
tors predict the salvation of humanity in Christ. Except for the 
architecture, these themes are expressed almost entirely by the 
human figure. 

The Sistine Chapel ceiling swarms with figures, most of 
them in the sort of restless posture seen in the Moses. For exam¬ 
ple, as seen in figure 16.19, the Libyan Sibyl (a sibyl was a pagan 
prophetess, in whose prophecies Christians saw evidence for the 
coming of Christ) barely sits on her throne, but twists backward 
to close her book. Her muscular forms derive from 
Michelangelo s life drawings of young men. (See Materials and 
Techniques , page 575.) These figures also stem from Michel¬ 
angelo s deep study of ancient sculpture, which he hoped to 
surpass. Since the cleaning of the frescoes in the 1980s, scholars 
have come to appreciate the brilliance of Michelangelo s colors, 
and the pairing of complementary colors he used in the draperies. 
(See The Art Historian's Lens , page 578.) 

A similar energy pervades the center narratives. The Fall of 
Man and The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (fig. 16.20) show 


574 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 





























































Drawings 

M edieval artists had used the technique of drawing to record mon¬ 
uments they had seen or to preserve compositions for future use. 
These drawings were usually made with pen and ink on parchment. 
During the Renaissance, the increasing availability of paper expanded 
the uses of drawings and encouraged artists to use a variety of medi¬ 
ums in making them. 

Pen and ink on paper were used most often, as the liquid ink could 
be transferred to the paper by means of a sharp quill pen or stylus. 
Sometimes the forms drawn with ink were further elaborated with a 
wash (usually diluted ink) applied with a brush. Some artists preferred 
to work with liquid mediums and thin brushes to render all the forms. 

Artists also drew on the relatively rough surface of paper using char¬ 
coal or chalk. These naturally occurring materials are both dry and 
crumbly enough to leave traces when the artist applies them to the 
paper. The lines they leave can be thick or thin, rendered with carefully 
descriptive marks or with quick evocative strokes. Artists could 
smudge these soft mediums to soften contours and fill in shadows, or 
to produce parallel lines called hatching to describe shadows. See, for 
example, the variety of strokes Michelangelo used to make the red 
chalk study for the Libyan Sibyl on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. 

More difficult to master was the technique of silverpoint. This 
entailed using a metal stylus to leave marks on a surface. Silver was 
the most prized metal for this technique, though lead was also used. 
Mistakes could not be undone, so it took great skill to work in silver- 
point. To make silver leave traces on paper, the paper had to be stiff¬ 
ened up by coating it with a mixture of finely ground bone and size (a 
gluelike substance). Such coatings were sometimes tinted. When the 
silver stylus is applied, thin delicate lines are left behind that darken 
with age. 

Renaissance artists also expanded the uses of drawings. 
Apprentices learned how to render forms using drawings; artists 
worked out solutions to visual problems with drawings. Drawings were 
also used to enable artists to negotiate contracts and to record 
finished works as a kind of diary or model book. 

Artists also made cartoons, or full-scale patterns, for larger works 
such as frescoes or tapestries (see fig. 1 6.26). Transferring designs 
from drawings onto larger surfaces could be achieved in a number of 
ways. A grid could be placed over the design to serve as a guide for 
replicating the image on a larger scale. Or cartoons for frescoes could

be pricked along the main lines of the design; through these tiny 
holes a powder was forced to reproduce the design on the wall. This 
is called pouncing. 

In the sixteenth century, drawings became prized in their own 
right and were collected by artists, patrons, and connoisseurs. The 
drawing was thought to reveal something that a finished work could 
not: the artist’s process, the artist’s personality, and ultimately, the 
artist’s genius. 


the bold, intense hues and expressive body language that charac¬ 
terize the whole ceiling. Michelangelo’s figures are full of life, act¬ 
ing out their epic roles in sparse landscape settings. To the left of 
the Tree of Knowledge, Adam and Eve form a spiral composition 
as they reach toward the forbidden fruit, while the composition of 
The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden is particularly close to 
Masaccio’s (see fig. 15.27) in its intense drama. The nude youths 
(;ignudi ) flanking the main sections of the ceiling play an impor¬ 
tant visual role in Michelangelo’s design. They are found at regu¬ 
lar intervals, forming a kind of chain linking the narratives. Yet 
their meaning remains uncertain. Some scholars have proposed 


that they represent the world of pagan antiquity Others have 
debated whether they are angels or images of human souls. They 
hold acorns, a reference to the popes family name, delle Rovere 
(rovere means “oak”). The ignudi also support bronze medallions 
that look like trophies, reminding the viewer of Julius’s military 
campaigns throughout Italy. 

The most memorable of the center narratives is The Creation 
of Adam (fig. 16.21). The fresco depicts not the physical molding 
of Adam’s body, but the passage to him of the divine spark—the 
soul. The expressive composition conveys a profound conception 
of the relationship between God and humankind. Michelangelo’s

design contrasts the earthbound Adam, who has been likened to 
an awakening river-god, with the dynamic figure of God rushing 
through the sky. Adam gazes not only toward his Creator, he also 
looks toward the figures in the shelter of Gods left arm. The 
identity of these figures has been vigorously debated: The female 
may be Eve, awaiting her creation in the next panel; another 
proposal is that she may be Mary, with Jesus at her knee, fore¬ 
ordained to redeem fallen humanity. The entire image has come to 
be seen as the perfect expression of Michelangelo s view of his 
own artistic creativity. 

After the death of Julius II in 1513, Michelangelo returned to 
his work on the popes tomb. But when Leo X (the son of 
Lorenzo de’ Medici) acceded to the papacy, he sent Michelangelo 
back to Llorence, to work on projects for the Medici family, 
which had been restored to power. There, his style developed and 
changed, until his eventual return to Rome in the 1530s. 

Raphael in Florence and Rome 

If Michelangelo represents the solitary genius, Raphael of Urbino 
(Raffaello Sanzio, 1483-1520) belongs to the opposite type: the 
artist as a man of the world. The contrast between them was clear 
to their contemporaries, and both enjoyed great fame. Vasari s 
book, with its championing of Michelangelo, helped to inspire 
later generations’ veneration of Michelangelo over Raphael, in 
part because of the two mens biographies. Where Michelangelo s 
dramatic conflicts with his art and with his patrons made a good 
narrative, Raphael s career seems too much a success story, his 
work too marked by effortless grace, to match the tragic heroism 
of Michelangelo. Raphael s gifts were in his technical brilliance, 
his intelligent approach to composing pictures, and his dialogue 
with the other artists of his time. He is the central painter of the 
High Renaissance. During his relatively brief career he created the 
largest body of Renaissance pictorial work outside of Titian s, one 
that is notable for its variety and power. He also oversaw a lively 
and large workshop, from which many artists of the next genera¬ 
tion emerged, effectively putting his stamp on the whole period. 

RAPHAEL’S EARLY MADONNAS Raphael had a genius for 
synthesis that enabled him to merge the qualities of Leonardo and 
Michelangelo. His art is lyrical and dramatic, pictorially rich and 
sculpturally solid. These qualities are already present in the 
Madonnas he painted in Llorence (1504-08) after his apprentice¬ 
ship with Perugino. The meditative calm of the so-called La Belle 
Jardiniere {Beautiful Gardener) (fig. 16.22) still reflects the style of 
his teacher; the forms are, however, more ample and the 
chiaroscuro expertly rendered. The young Jesus and John the 
Baptist have perfect little bodies, posed in graceful postures to 
interact with each other and the Virgin. Lor this image, Raphael 
reworks a composition by Leonardo, but he replaces the enig¬ 
matic gestures in The Virgin of the Rocks with a gentle, rhythmic 
interplay. Raphael substitutes for Leonardo s intricate grouping a 
stable pyramid whose severity is relieved by Mary s billowing 
cape. Equally striking is the carefully observed landscape, whose

bright light and natural beauty provide an appropriate setting for 
the figure group. 

One of the reasons La Belle Jardiniere looks different from 
The Virgin of the Rocks (see fig. 16.5), to which it is otherwise so 
clearly indebted, is Michelangelo s influence, which is seen in the 
figural composition. The full force of this influence can be felt 
only in Raphaels Roman works, however. In 1508, at the time 
Michelangelo began to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, Julius II 
summoned Raphael from Llorence at the suggestion of Bramante, 
who also came from Urbino. At first, Raphael mined ideas he had 
developed under his teacher Perugino, but Rome utterly trans¬ 
formed him as an artist, just as it had Bramante, and he underwent 
an astonishing growth.

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 




Cleaning and Restoring Works of Art 


tn 


O ne of the most controversial topics in contemporary art history is 
whether and how to clean venerable but soiled works of art. 
Heated exchanges, accusations, and lawsuits regularly accompany 
cleaning and restoration projects. Cleaning means just that—removing 
soot, grime, pollutants, and sometimes layers of varnish or other 
protective materials earlier generations of owners put on a work. 
Restoration may involve replacing missing elements in a work to 
suggest to a viewer what an object looked like on its completion. Both 
processes are hotly debated today. 

Many of the most famous images from the Renaissance have been 
at the center of these controversies: Giotto’s Arena Chapel, Masaccio’s 
Brancacci Chapel, Leonardo’s Last Supper, Michelangelo’s frescoes 
at the Sistine Chapel, and Michelangelo’s David. Questions arise 
because of the jarring outcomes that can result from cleaning 
projects. For example, when the Sistine Chapel ceiling was cleaned in 
the 1 980s, critics complained that the process removed the top layer 
of the paint, leaving only “garish” underpainting. Michelangelo’s 
reputation as a colorist has been permanently changed by the clean¬ 
ing of the ceiling frescoes. 

The techniques of cleaning vary according to the medium and 
condition of the work, but conservators try to use the least damaging 
solvents possible, and they document every step they take. Work can 
be very slow, as in the case of The Last Supper. The project took 20 
years, as cleaners had to contend with the work of earlier “restorers,” 
who had filled in missing sections of the image with new paint. 


Current cleaning removed overpaints, and filled in missing areas 
with removable water-based pigment. Restorers today are careful 
to add only materials that can be removed without damaging the 
original object. 

Museums routinely clean objects in their care to conserve them. 
Major museums keep large conservation laboratories staffed by art 
historians, chemists, and artists to treat works of art. Often the impe¬ 
tus and funding for such projects comes when an object is requested 
for an important exhibition. In the case of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a 
corporation underwrote the cleaning of the ceiling in exchange for the 
rights to make a film about the process. Philanthropic and corporate 
donors have supported many recent cleaning projects. 

The David offers a good example of why objects need cleaning. The 
statue stood in the Piazza della Signoria for almost four centuries, 
subjected to pollutants and humidity, until it was removed to the 
Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence in 1 873. (A copy now stands in the 
Piazza.) In 2003, a cleaning program was undertaken, again amidst 
protests: Critics wanted a minimally invasive dry cleaning (like a care¬ 
ful dusting), but the curators used a distilled water, clay, and cellulose 
paste to draw pollutants out of the marble. Mineral spirits (solvents) 
were used to remove wax on the marble. 

Perhaps the one object from the High Renaissance most in need of 
cleaning today—but unlikely to receive it—is Leonardo’s Mona Lisa. 
The current directors of the Louvre have said that no such cleaning 
is planned.

FRESCOES FOR THE STANZA DELLA SEGNATURA The 

results can be seen in the Stanza della Segnatura (fig. 16.23), the 
first in a series of rooms which Julius commissioned him to 
decorate at the Vatican Palace. The frescoes painted by Raphael in 
this room show an almost endless fertility in the creation of 
daring narrative compositions. The “Room of the Signature,” as 
it is translated, derives its name from its later function as the 
place where papal bulls (documents) were signed, though origi¬ 
nally it housed Julius Us personal library. Beginning in 1508, 
Raphael painted a cycle of frescoes on its walls and ceiling that 
refer to the four domains of learning: theology, philosophy, law, 
and the arts. In general, the Stanza represents a summation of 
High Renaissance humanism, for it attempts to represent the 
unity of knowledge in one grand scheme. Raphael probably had a 
team of scholars and theologians as advisors, yet the design is 
his alone. 

To represent these subjects, Raphael depicted figures from 
history and mythology in illusionistic spaces. For the arts, for 
example, the space above and flanking a window depicts 


Parnassus, the sacred mountain of Apollo. The god appears play¬ 
ing a lyre in a grove of laurel trees surrounded by the Nine Muses 
and great poets from antiquity down to the artist s own time. 
Dante stands on the left, near the blind Homer, Petrarch stands to 
the right, while Sappho appears to lean on the window frame at 
lower left. Her figure and that of the poet opposite her connect 
the painted Parnassus with the space of the room. Raphael uses 
the same illusionistic device that Mantegna exploited in the 
Camera Picta in Mantua (see fig. 15.49). The painting reflects the 
papal court s dream of a Golden Age under Julius II, in which the 
Vatican Hill would become the new Parnassus. 

Of all the frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura, The School of 
Athens (fig. 16.24) has long been acknowledged as Raphael s mas¬ 
terpiece and the embodiment of the classical spirit of the High 
Renaissance. The title was only assigned later, and the subject of 
the painting has been much debated. The fresco seems to repre¬ 
sent a group of famous Greek philosophers gathered around Plato 
and Aristotle, each in a characteristic pose or activity Raphael 
may have already studied parts of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, then

nearing completion: He owes to Michelangelo the expressive 
energy, the physical power, and dramatic grouping of his figures. 
Yet he has not simply borrowed Michelangelo’s gestures and 
poses. He has absorbed them into his own style and thus given 
them a different meaning. Body and spirit, action and emotion are 
balanced harmoniously, and all members of this great assembly 
play their roles with magnificent, purposeful clarity. 

The conception of The School of Athens suggests the spirit of 
Leonardo’s The Last Supper (see fig. 16.6), as Raphael organizes 
his figures into groups like Leonardo’s. He further distinguishes 
the relationships among individuals and groups, and links them in 
a formal rhythm. (The artist worked out the poses in a series of 
drawings, many made from life.) Also in the spirit of Leonardo is 
the symmetrical design, as well as the interdependence of the fig¬ 
ures and their architectural setting. Like Leonardo’s work, an 
opening in the building serves as a frame for the key figures. But 
Raphael’s building plays a greater role in the composition than the 
hall does in The Last Supper. With its lofty dome, barrel vault, and 
colossal statuary, it is classical in spirit, yet Christian in meaning. 
Inspired by Bramante, who, Vasari informs us, helped Raphael 
with the architecture, the building seems like an advance view of 
the new St. Peter’s, then being constructed. Capacious, luxurious, 
overpowering, the building is more inspired by Roman struc¬ 
tures, such as the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine (see fig. 
7.60), than by anything Greek. Yet two illusionistically rendered 
sculptures of Greek divinities preside over this gathering of 
learned men of the Greek past: Apollo, patron of the arts with his 
lyre to the left, and Athena, in her guise as Minerva, goddess of 
wisdom, on the right. 

The program of The School of Athens reflects the most learned 
humanism of the day, which commentators are still elucidating. 
Since Vasari’s time, historians have attempted to identify the fig¬ 
ures inhabiting this imposing space. At center stage, Plato (whose 
face resembles Leonardo s) holds his book about cosmology and 
numerology, Timaeus , which provided the basis for much of the 
Neo-Platonism that came to pervade Christianity. To Plato’s left 
(a viewer’s right), his pupil Aristotle grasps a volume of his Ethics , 
which, like his science, is grounded in what is knowable in the 
material world. The tomes explain why Plato is pointing rhetori¬ 
cally to the heavens, Aristotle to the earth. The figures represent 
the two most important Greek philosophers, whose approaches, 
although seemingly opposite, were deemed complementary by 
many Renaissance humanists. In this composition, the two 
schools of philosophy come together. 

Some believe that Raphael organized his array of philosophers 
to reflect the two camps: the idealists and the empiricists. To 
Plato’s right is his mentor, Socrates, who addresses a group of dis¬ 
ciples by counting out his arguments on his fingers. Standing 
before the steps are figures representing mathematics and physics 
(the lower branches of philosophy that are the gateway to higher 
knowledge). Here appears the bearded Pythagoras, for whom the 
truth of all things is to be found in numbers. The diagrams and 
sums on the tablets at his feet symbolize the importance of num¬ 
ber in philosophy. On the other side of the same plane, Raphael 


borrowed the features of Bramante for the head of Euclid, seen 
drawing or measuring two overlapping triangles with a pair of 
compasses in the foreground to the lower right. Behind him, two 
men holding globes may represent Zoroaster the astronomer and 
Ptolemy the geographer. Vasari tells us that the man wearing a 
black hat behind these scientists is a self-portrait of Raphael, who 
places himself in the Aristotelian camp. 

Despite the competition between them, Raphael added 
Michelangelo at the last minute (as revealed by his insertion of a 
layer of fresh plaster or intonaco on which to paint the new figure), 
whom he has cast as Heraclitus, a sixth-century BCE philosopher, 
shown deep in thought sitting on the steps in the Platonic camp. 
(Heraclitus was often paired with Diogenes the Cynic, shown here 
lying at the feet of Plato and Aristotle.) Scholars have remarked 
that this figure is not only a portrait of the sculptor, but is ren¬ 
dered in the style of the figures on the nearby Sistine Chapel ceil¬ 
ing. The inclusion of so many artists among, as well as in the guise 
of, famous philosophers is testimony to their recently acquired— 
and hard-won—status as members of the learned community. 

PAPAL AND PRIVATE COMMISSIONS After Julius II died 
in 1513, Raphael was hired by his successor, Leo X, who ordered

him to finish painting the papal apartments. The pope also sat for 
portraits. In the Portrait of Pope Leo X with Cardinals Giulio de ’ 
Medici and Luigi de ’ Rossi (fig. 16.25), painted about 1517, 
Raphael did little to improve the heavy-jowled features of the 
pope, or the faces of his associates. (Giulio de’ Medici, on the left, 
became pope himself in 1523, as Clement VII.) The three men are 
gathered around a table, on which rests a beautifully worked bell 
and an illuminated manuscript. Rather than a spiritual being or a 
warrior, the pope is represented as a collector and connoisseur, 
shown examining a precious object. The textures of the brocades 
and fur-lined garment only add to the sensual experience. Light 
enters this space from a window on the right whose shape is 
reflected in the brass ball of the chair’s finial, a reference to the 
Medici coat of arms. This meditation on the sense of sight owes a 
debt to Netherlandish art. Leo sent the portrait to Florence to 
serve as his stand-in during wedding festivities for his Medici 
cousins there. 


Raphael’s work clearly pleased the new pope. After 
Bramante’s death in 1514, Raphael was named the architect of 
St. Peters and subsequently superintendent of antiquities in 
Rome. In 1516, Pope Leo X sent Michelangelo to Florence to 
work at San Lorenzo, leaving Raphael as the leading artist in 
Rome. He was flooded with commissions, and of necessity 
depended increasingly on his growing workshop. 

In 1515-16, the pope commissioned Raphael to design a set of 
tapestries on the theme of the Acts of the Apostles for the Sistine 
Chapel. The commission placed him in direct competition with 
Michelangelo; consequently, Raphael designed and executed the 
ten huge cartoons (see Materials and Techniques , page 575) for this 
series with great care and enthusiasm. Because the cartoons were 
sent to Flanders to be woven, they helped to spread High 
Renaissance ideas from Italy to northern Europe. One of the most 
influential of these cartoons is St. Paul Preaching at Athens (fig. 
16.26), which demonstrates Raphael’s synthesizing genius.

1 6.27 Raphael, Galatea , Villa Farnesina, Rome. ca. 1513. Fresco, 9'8V x 7'4" (3 x 2.2 m) 


For the imposing figure of St. Paul, Raphael has adapted the 
severity and simplicity of Masaccio s Brancacci Chapel frescoes 
(see figs. 15.24-15.27). The power of the saint s words is expressed 
not only by his gestures, but by the responses of the volumi¬ 
nously clad audience. Bramante inspires the architecture that 
defines the space; the plain Tuscan order of the columns in the 
round temple in the background recalls the Tempietto (see fig. 
16.8). Instead of allowing the eye to wander deeply into the dis¬ 
tance, Raphael limits the space to a foreground plane, into which 
a viewer is invited by the steps in the foreground. The simplicity 


and grandeur of the conception conveys the narrative in bold, 
clear terms that are only enhanced by the large scale of the figures. 

Other patrons in Rome also engaged Raphael s busy work¬ 
shop; the powerful Sienese banker Agostino Chigi hired Raphael 
to adorn his new villa in Rome, now called the Villa Farnesina 
after a later owner. The building served as the setting for 
Chigi s interests: in the antique, in conspicuous display, and in 
love. Throughout the villa he commissioned frescoes on themes 
from the pagan past. For this setting, Raphael painted the 
Galatea around 1513 (fig. 16.27). The beautiful nymph Galatea,

On Raphael's Death 

Raphael died in Rome in April ofl520. In a letter to Isabella d’Este, the 
duchess of Mantua, the humanist Pandolfo Pico della Mirandola tells 
her about the artist's death and the reaction of Rome to his loss. 

... now I shall inform you of ... the death of Raphael of Urbino, who 
died last night, that is, on Good Friday, leaving this court in the great¬ 
est and most universal distress because of the loss of hope for the very 
great things one expected of him that would have given glory to our 


time. And indeed it is said about this that he gave promise for every¬ 
thing great, through what one could already see of his works and 
through the grander ones he had begun. ... Here one speaks of 
nothing else but of the death of this good man, who at thirty-three 
years of age has finished his first life; his second one, however, that of 
fame which is not subject to time and death, will be eternal, both 
through his works and through the men of learning that will write in 
his praise.

vainly pursued by the giant Polyphemus, belongs to Greek 
mythology, known to the Renaissance through the verses of Ovid. 
Raphael s Galatea celebrates the sensuality of the pagan spirit as if 
it were a living force. Although the composition of the nude female 
riding a seashell recalls Botticelli s The Birth ofVenus (see fig. 15.40), 
a painting Raphael may have known in Florence, the resemblance 
only serves to emphasize their profound differences. Raphael s 
figures are vigorously sculptural and arranged in a dynamic spiral 
movement around the twisting Galatea. In Botticelli s picture, the 
movement is not generated by the figures but imposed on them 
by the decorative, linear design that places all the figures on the 
same plane. Like Michelangelo, Raphael uses the arrangement of 
figures, rather than any detailed perspective scheme, to call up an 
illusion of space and to create a vortex of movement. 

Raphael s statuesque, full-bodied figures suggest his careful 
study of ancient Roman sculpture which, like Michelangelo, he 
wanted to surpass. An even more direct example of his use of 
antique sources is his design for the engraving of The Judgment of 


Paris by Marcantonio Raimondi, executed about 1520 (fig. 16.28). 
Collectors increasingly desired to own Raphael s drawings, so he 
used the skills of the engraver to record and to spread his designs. 
Raphael based this one on a Roman sarcophagus panel, which he 
has interpreted rather than copied. The engraving depicts the 
Judgment of Paris witnessed by the Olympian gods in heaven and 
a group of river-gods on the lower right. The statuesque figures 
are firmly defined in the engravings through the strong contours 
and chiaroscuro, and they occupy a frontal plane across the 
images. In images like this, Raphael translated the art of antiquity 
for generations of artists to come. 

Raphael s life was cut short in 1520, when he died after a brief 
illness. Roman society mourned him bitterly, according to the 
reports of witnesses. (See Primary Source , above.) Befitting the 
new status assigned to artists, he was buried in the Pantheon. 
Significantly, many of the leading artists of the next generation 
emerged from Raphael s workshop and took his style as their 
point of departure.

OUR 








VENICE 

As Rome became the center of an imperial papal style of art, 
Venice endured the enmity of its neighbors and the dismantling of 
its northern Italian empire. Having gradually expanded its influ¬ 
ence over northeastern Italy, in 1509 the Republic of Venice faced 
a threat from the League of Cambrai, an international military 
alliance aimed against it. Yet, by 1529, Venice had outlasted this 
menace to its power and reclaimed most of its lost territory. 
Resisting the invasions of Europe by the Turks, Venice’s navy 
fought determinedly in the eastern Mediterranean to hold off this 
threat. In the midst of this turmoil, artists in Venice built on the 
traditions of the fifteenth century and the innovations of 
Giovanni Bellini to create a distinct visual language. Two artists in 
particular, Giorgione and Titian, created new subjects, approaches 
to images, and techniques. 

Giorgione 

Giorgione da Castelfranco (1478-1510) left the orbit of Giovanni 
Bellini (see figs. 15.53 and 15.54) to create some of the most mys¬ 
terious and beguiling paintings of the Renaissance. Although he 
painted some religious works, he seems to have specialized in 
smaller-scale paintings on secular themes for the homes of 
wealthy collectors. His death at a young age, probably from the 
plague, left the field open for his young colleague, Titian, who 
worked in his shop for some time. Some of the works tradition¬ 
ally ascribed to Giorgione have, in fact, been argued for Titian in 
recent years. Many of his works defy attempts to interpret them. 

This is the case with Giorgiones The Tempest (fig. 16.29). 
Documents record the picture in the collection of the patrician 
Gabriele Vendramin, one of Venice’s greatest patrons of the arts. 
Scholars have offered many possible explanations of this image, 
which depicts a stormy landscape inhabited by a male figure on 
the left and a nursing mother on the right. The male has been 
identified as a shepherd, a warrior, or an angel; the nude woman 
has been identified as Eve, as Hagar, as Venus, or Nature herself. 
The figures, and thus any narrative content, remain enigmatic. In 
fact, Giorgione’s landscape seems to provide the key to interpre¬ 
tation. With its verdant setting and humid atmosphere, the scene 
is like an enchanted idyll, a dream of pastoral beauty soon to be 
swept away, as the fury of a summer thunderstorm lights the sky. 
While the painting is very similar in mood to that conjured by the 
Arcadia of Jacopo Sannazaro, a poem about unrequited love that 
was popular in Giorgiones day, even such parallels do not 
account for all the details in the image. Scholars have argued that 
The Tempest initiates what was to become an important new 
tradition in art, the making of pictorial equivalents to poetry or 
poesie , as contemporaries called them: atmospheric images that set 
a mood rather than convey a story. Nonetheless, what the origi¬ 
nal audience may have read into the image continues to perplex 
modern viewers. 

A similar problem confronts the viewer of the so-called Fete 
Champetre or Pastoral Concert (fig. 16.30). The picture has been 


on display in the Louvre in Paris since the nineteenth century, 
where it arrived from the French royal collection. It depicts a 
group of young people gathered in a lush landscape to make 
music when a shepherd and his flock come upon them. Attempts 
to find a narrative subject to attach to this image have proven 
fruitless: No single literary source seems to account for it. Most 
puzzling are the nude women, one of whom is about to play a 
recorder, while another takes water from a fountain. One 
proposal identifies them as the Muses, ancient female divinities 
who inspire the arts. The forms are rendered in a soft chiaroscuro 
technique so that they emerge from the atmospheric landscape as 
soft round shapes. The landscape moves from dark to light to 
dark passages, receding into the atmospheric distance. There is 
some evidence that the young Titian may have intervened in this 
work. Instead of telling a story, the painting seems designed to 
evoke a mood. 

Vasari criticized Giorgione for not making drawings as part of 
his process of painting. (See ,) Steeped in the 

Florentine tradition of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, 
Vasari argued that drawing, or disegno was fundamental to good 
painting. The Venetians, however, valued light and color above all 
else to create their sensual images. Vasari dismissed this as mere 
colore , which he argued was secondary to the process of drawing. 
The resulting competition between disegno and colore provided

the grounds for criticizing or praising paintings well beyond the 
sixteenth century. 

Titian 

Giorgione died before he could fully explore the sensuous, lyrical 
world he had created in the Fete Champetre. This task was taken 
up by Titian (Tiziano Vecellio, 1488/90-1576), who trained with 
Bellini and then with Giorgione and even repainted some of their 
works. Titian would dominate Venetian painting for the next half- 
century. Throughout his long life, he earned commissions from 
the most illustrious patrons in Europe; he trained many of the 
most important Venetian artists of the next century. 

Titian s interpretation of the legacy of Giorgione may be seen 
in the Bacchanal (fig. 16.31), commissioned around 1518 by 
Alfonso d’Este, the duke of Ferrara, for his Camerino d’Alabastro 
(Little Room of Alabaster). In this painting Titian attempted to 
remake a Roman painting known only from descriptions by the 
Roman author Philostratus. The theme is the effect of a river of 


wine on the inhabitants of the island of Andros. Titian depicts a 
crowd of figures in various stages of undress hoisting jugs of wine 
and generally misbehaving. The painting thus competes with both 
antique art and literature. Titian s landscape, rich in contrasts of 
cool and warm tones, has all the poetry of Giorgione, but the 
figures are of another breed. Active and muscular, they move with 
a joyous freedom that recalls Raphaels Galatea (see fig. 16.27). 

By this time, many of Michelangelo s and Raphael s composi¬ 
tions had been engraved; it was from these reproductions that 
Titian became familiar with the Roman High Renaissance. At 
least one figure, the man bending over to fill his jug in the river, 
may be copied from Michelangelo. A number of the figures in his 
Bacchanal also reflect the influence of classical art. Titians 
approach to antiquity, however, is very different from Raphael s. 
He visualizes the realm of ancient myths as part of the natural 
world, inhabited not by animated statues but by beings of flesh 
and blood. The nude young woman who has passed out in the 
lower right corner is posed in such a way as to show off her beau¬ 
tiful young body for the viewer s pleasure. The figures of the

Bacchanal are idealized just enough to persuade us that they 
belong to a long-lost Golden Age. They invite us to share their 
blissful state in a way that makes the Galatea seem cold and 
remote by comparison. 

Titian s ability to transform older traditions can also be seen in 
his Madonna with Members of the Pesaro Family (fig. 16.32), com¬ 
missioned in 1519 and installed in 1526 on the altar of the 
Immaculate Conception of the Franciscan church of Santa Maria 
Gloriosa dei Frari. Here, he takes a sacra conversazione in the tra¬ 
dition of Domenico Veneziano and Giovanni Bellini (see figs. 
15.30 and 15.54) and reimagines both the composition and the fig¬ 
ures. He sets the Virgin and Child at the apex of a triangular 
arrangement of figures, but replaces the familiar frontal view with 
an oblique one that is far more active. The infant Jesus is as natu¬ 
ral as the child in the Bacchanal , pudgy and innocently playing 
with his mother s veil. More solemnly, the Virgin and St. Peter 
turn to the donor, Jacopo Pesaro, seen kneeling in devotion at the 


left. On the other side are the donors brothers and sons with SS. 
Francis and Anthony of Padua. 

Titian places the Virgin s throne on the steps of a monumental 
church. The huge columns, which are the key to the setting, rep¬ 
resent the gateway to Heaven, traditionally identified with Mary 
herself; the painting celebrates her as the Immaculate Conception, 
who was born without Original Sin. Because the view is diagonal, 
open sky and clouds fill most of the background. Except for the 
kneeling donors, every figure seems to move. The officer with the 
flag bearing the coats of arms of Pesaro and of Pope Alexander VI 
seems ready to lead a charge up the steps. He is probably

St. Maurice, namesake of the battle at Santa Mauro. There, the 
papal fleet commanded by Pesaro, bishop of Paphos, and the 
Venetian navy, under his cousin Benedetto Pesaro, defeated the 
Turks in 1502—note the turbaned figure beside him. St. Peter, 
identified by the key near his foot, represents the Catholic Church 
victorious over Islam and, as Pesaro s patron saint, acts as his 
intercessor with the Madonna. The design remains harmoniously 
self-contained, despite the strong drama. Brilliant sunlight makes 
every color and texture sparkle, in keeping with the joyous spirit 
of the altar. The only hint of tragedy is the cross held by the two 
little angels. Hidden by clouds from the participants in the sacra 
conversazione , it adds a note of poignancy to the scene. 

After Raphael s death, Titian became the most sought-after 
portraitist of the age. His immense gifts, evident in the donors 5 
portraits in the Pesaro Madonna , are equally striking in the Man 
with a Blue Sleeve (fig. 16.33). Titian places his sitter against a 
nonspecific backdrop behind a stone parapet, on which his initials 
(“T. V. 55 for Tiziano Vecellio) appear. This is an arrangement 
pioneered by Flemish painters. The man turns to look at a viewer, 


making eye contact. His self-confident air is expressed not only 
by his cool glance, but also by the commanding presence of the 
mans projecting arm, which appears to reach out into a viewers 
space. The man also wears a fur robe: His garment indicates his 
elite social status. Titian records the textures of hair, cloth, and 
stone with great fidelity, all the while wrapping his figure in an 
atmospheric space through his use of chiaroscuro. The identity of 
the sitter is not known, but Titian attempts to record his person¬ 
ality as well as his appearance. An early tradition identified the 
man as the poet Ariosto; another hypothesis identifies him as a 
Venetian patrician for whose family Titian worked; yet another 
would claim this as a self-portrait. In any case, Titian s links to 
Bellini and to Giorgione shine through in this image. 

Titian s career was to last long into the sixteenth century 
His art is based on nature, whose likeness he records with great 
skill. He endows his figures with grace and personality, and wraps 
them in atmospheric light. Titian s gift for compositions using 
naturalistic forms inspired by the ancient world make him a true 
representative of the High Renaissance.

The Late Renaissance 
and Mannerism in Sixteenth- 

Century Italy 




F rom the moment that martin luther posted his challenge 

to the Roman Catholic Church in Wittenberg in 1517, the political and 
cultural landscape of Europe began to change. Europe’s ostensible religious 
unity was fractured as entire regions left the Catholic fold. The great 
powers of France, Spain, and Germany warred with each other on the Italian 


peninsula, even as the Turkish expansion into Europe threatened 
all. The spiritual challenge of the Reformation and the rise of 
powerful courts affected Italian artists in this period by changing 
the climate in which they worked and the nature of their patron¬ 
age. No single style dominated the sixteenth century in Italy, 
though all the artists working in what is conventionally called the 
Late Renaissance were profoundly affected by the achievements 
of the High Renaissance. 

The authority of the generation of the High Renaissance 
would both challenge and nourish later generations of artists. In 
the works of Leonardo, Raphael, Bramante, and Giorgione, 
younger artists could observe their elders’ skillful rendering of 
chiaroscuro, perspective, and sfumato, as well as the elder gener¬ 
ation s veneration of antiquity. The new generations imitated their 
technical expertise, their compositions, and their themes. At the 
same time, the artists of the High Renaissance continued to seek 
new ways to solve visual problems. Indeed, two of the key figures 
of the older generation lived to transform their styles: 
Michelangelo was active until 1564, and Titian until 1576. 

The notion of the artist as an especially creative figure was 
passed on to later generations, yet much had changed. 
International interventions in Italy came to a head in 1527 when 
Rome itself was invaded and sacked by imperial troops of the

Habsburgs; three years later, Charles V was crowned Holy 
Roman emperor in Bologna. His presence in Italy had important 
repercussions: In 1530, he overthrew the reestablished Republic 
of Florence and restored the Medici to power. Cosimo I de’ 
Medici became duke of Florence in 1537 and grand duke of 
Tuscany in 1569. Charles also promoted the rule of the Gonzaga 
of Mantua and awarded a knighthood to Titian. He and his suc¬ 
cessors became avid patrons of Titian, spreading the influence and 
prestige of Italian Renaissance style throughout Europe. 

The Protestant movement spread quickly through northern 
Europe, as Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and other theologians 
rejected papal authority and redefined Christian doctrine. Some 
of the reformers urged their followers to destroy religious images 
as idolatrous, leading to widespread destruction of images, stained 
glass, and other religious art. Italy itself, home of the Roman 
Catholic Church, resisted the new faiths. Nonetheless, through 
the first half of the sixteenth century, pressures for reform within 
the Catholic Church grew. The Roman Church had traditionally 
approved the role of images as tools for teaching and for encour¬ 
aging piety, and through the efforts of reformers, this was now 
affirmed as official Church policy. (See www.myartslab.com. ) But 
with its authority threatened by the Protestant Reformation, the 
Catholic Church asserted even more control over the content and 
style of images to assure doctrinal correctness. As it sought to 
define itself against the Protestant Reformation, religious imagery 
became increasingly standardized.

Map 1 7.1 Travels of some artists in sixteenth-century Italy 


Artists responded to all these phenomena. The Sack of Rome 
in 1527 scattered Roman-based artists throughout Italy and 
Europe (map 17.1). Commissions came mostly from the princely 
courts, so artists’ works reflected the taste and concerns of this 
powerful elite. The connections among the courts helped to 
spread a new style, usually labeled Mannerist, which lasted 
through much of the century. The style was typically used for 
paintings and sculptures, though some works of architecture 
exhibit Mannerist tendencies. 

The term derived from the word maniera , meaning manner or 
style, which was used approvingly by contemporaries. Building 
on the achievements of Raphael and Michelangelo, above all, 
artists of the 1520s and later developed a style that emphasized 
technical virtuosity, erudite subject matter, beautiful figures, and 
deliberately complex compositions that would appeal to sophisti¬ 
cated tastes. Mannerism became a style of utmost refinement, 
which emphasized grace, variety, and virtuoso display instead of 
clarity and unity Mannerist artists self-consciously explored new 
definitions of beauty: Rather than repeat ancient forms, they 


experimented with proportions, ideal figure types, and unusual 
compositions. Like the artists of the High Renaissance, they 
aimed for originality and personal expression, which they consid¬ 
ered their due as privileged creators. 

Just what Mannerism represented continues to spark debate. 
Some have argued that it signified a decline, because it rejected 
the standards of the High Renaissance. (These critics, of course, 
prefer the “classical” works of the High Renaissance.) But the 
reasons that artists rejected the stability, assurance, and ideal 
forms of the High Renaissance are not well understood. Perhaps 
the new generation was attempting to define itself as different 
from its elders. Or, Mannerism may be seen as an expression of 
cultural crisis. Some scholars relate it to the spiritual crises 
brought on by the Reformation and the Catholic Counter- 
Reformation, while others see Mannerism as the product of an 
elite class’s identity and taste. Even as scholars debate its origins 
and meanings, it is clear that Mannerism’s earliest products appear 
in Florence in the 1520s, which was very different from the 
Florence of 1505. 


592 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 














LATE RENAISSANCE FLORENCE: 

THE CHURCH, THE COURT, 

AND MANNERISM 

Under Medici rule, from 1512 to 1527, Florentine artists absorbed 
the innovations of the High Renaissance. Pope Leo X sent 
Michelangelo from Rome to Florence to work on projects for the 
Medici. The artistic descendants of Raphael came to the city as 



17.1 Rosso Fiorentino, The Descent from the Cross. 1521.

in Volterra. Pinacoteca Comunale, Volterra 


well. Having contributed so much to the development of the 
Early and High Renaissance, Florentine artists now developed a 
new style that seems to reject the serenity and confidence of High 
Renaissance art. Using the techniques of naturalism, chiaroscuro, 
and figural composition learned from Leonardo, Michelangelo, 
and Raphael, this generation of artists made images that are less 
balanced and more expressive than those of the earlier generation. 
In works of the 1520s, a group of Florentine artists created images 
of deep spiritual power in this new style. This spiritual resurgence 
may be a reaction to the challenges of the Reformation, or it may 
be due to the legacy of the fiery preacher Savonarola, who had 
preached repentance in Florence in the 1490s. 

Florentine Religious Painting in the 1520s 

An early expression of the new style appears in The Descent from 
the Cross (fig. 17.1) by Rosso Fiorentino (1495-1540), whose style 
is very idiosyncratic. A religious society of flagellants, Catholics 
whose penitential rituals included whipping themselves to express 
penitence, hired Rosso to paint this altarpiece in 1521. The 
Company of the Cross of the Day in the Tuscan city of Volterra 
chose the theme of the lowering of the body of Christ from the 
Cross, the subject of Rogier van der Weydens painting of 1438 
(see fig. 14.15). To reference the name of the sponsoring group, 
Rosso has given a great deal of emphasis to the Cross itself. While 
the composition looks back in part to Early Renaissance art, such 
as Masaccios Trinity fresco (see fig. 15.23), the composition is 
much less stable than the triangle used by Masaccio. Instead of 
moving slowly and carefully back into space, the forms all appear 
on the same plane. The muscular bodies of the agitated figures 
recall Michelangelo, but the draperies have brittle, sharp-edged 
planes. The low horizon line sets the figures against a dark sky, 
creating a disquieting effect. The colors are not primaries but 
sharply contrasting, and the brilliant light seems to fall on the 
bodies irrationally. Unlike the orderly calm and deep space of 
Leonardo s The Last Supper (see fig. 16.6), Rosso creates an unsta¬ 
ble composition within a compressed space staffed by figures that 
move frantically to lower the body of Christ. Only Christ s figure 
appears serene in the midst of this emotionally charged image. 
The Mannerist rejection of High Renaissance ideals allows Rosso 
to create in The Descent from the Cross a work that was especially 
appropriate to the piety of the confraternity members who com¬ 
missioned it. Rosso himself left central Italy after the Sack of 
Rome in 1527 by Charles V, ultimately being lured to France to 
work for Francis I at his palace of Fontainebleau (see map 17.1 
and Chapter 18). 

Rossos friend and contemporary Jacopo da Pontormo 
(1494-1556) developed his own version of the Mannerist style. 
The Capponi family hired Pontormo to transform their family 
chapel in the church of Santa Felicita in Florence (fig. 17.2). The 
architecture of the chapel, built around 1420, is Brunelleschian 
in its simplicity, consisting of a dome over a square room, as in 
the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo (see fig. 15.6). When Ludovico 
di Gino Capponi acquired its patronage in 1525, to be used as

a funerary chapel, he changed its dedication to the Pieta. Fie 
commissioned Pontormo to paint the altarpiece (fig. 17.3) and 
frescoes on the walls and dome. The altarpiece, completed by 
1528, remains in its original location in the chapel. 

Pontormos painting contrasts sharply with Rosso s The 
Descent from the Cross. It lacks a cross or any other indications 
of a specific narrative, so its subject is unclear, although the 
chapel s dedication points to the Pieta. The Virgin swoons as two 
androgynous figures hold up the body of Christ for a viewer s 
contemplation. Unlike Rossos elongated forms, Pontormos 
figures display an ideal beauty and sculptural solidity inspired 
by Michelangelo, yet Pontormo has squeezed them into an 
implausibly confined space. 

In Pontormo s painting, everything is subordinated to the play 
of graceful rhythms created by the tightly interlocking forms. The 
colors are desaturated: pale blues, pinks, oranges, and greens that 


may have been inspired by the colors of the Sistine Chapel ceiling 
(see fig. 16.19). Although they seem to act together, the mourners 
are lost in a grief too personal to share with one another. In this 
hushed atmosphere, anguish is transformed into a lyrical expres¬ 
sion of exquisite sensitivity. The entire scene is as haunted as 
Pontormos self-portrait just to the right of the swooning 
Madonna. The body of Christ is held up for a viewer, much as the 
host is during the Mass, the image conveying to believers a sense 
of the tragic scale of Christs sacrifice, which the Eucharist 
reenacts. Originally, the dome above the altarpiece depicted God 
the Father, to whom the body would be offered. Pontormo may 
have rejected the values of the High Renaissance, but he endows 
this image with deeply felt emotion.

The Medici in Florence: 

From Dynasty to Duchy 

In the chaos after the Sack of Rome of 1527, the Medici were again 
ousted from Florence and the Republic of Florence was rein¬ 
stated. But the restoration of relations between the pope and the 
Holy Roman emperor allowed the Medici to return to power by 
1530. The Medici pope Clement VII (r. 1523-1534) promoted his 
family’s interests, and worked to enhance their power as the rulers 
of Florence. Although he was an ardent republican, Michelangelo 
was continually employed by this court, executing works 
intended to glorify the Medici dynasty in Florence. 

THE NEW SACRISTY OF SAN LORENZO Michelangelo’s 
activities centered on the Medici church of San Lorenzo. A cen¬ 
tury after Brunelleschi’s design for the sacristy of this church (see 
fig. 15.6), which held the tombs of an earlier generation of Medici, 


Pope Leo X decided to build a matching structure, the New 
Sacristy. It was to house the tombs of Leo X’s father, Lorenzo the 
Magnificent, Lorenzo’s brother Giuliano, and two younger 
members of the family, also named Lorenzo and Giuliano. Aided 
by numerous assistants, Michelangelo worked on the project 
from 1519 to 1534 and managed to complete the architecture and 
two of the tombs, those for the later Lorenzo and Giuliano (fig. 
17.4); these tombs are nearly mirror images of each other. 
Michelangelo conceived of the New Sacristy as an architectural- 
sculptural ensemble. 

Michelangelo’s chapel starts from Brunelleschi’s design for a 
square space covered by a dome, though he inserted another story 
above the architrave and below the supports for the dome. This 
gives the chapel greater verticality and brings in more light. The 
wall scheme also follows Brunelleschi, although the pietra serena 
pilasters and entablatures are bolder and taller than Brunelleschi’s. 
Between the pilasters Michelangelo inserted blind windows

topped by curved pediments. Such features activate the wall, 
leaving little blank surface; Michelangelo treated the walls them¬ 
selves as sculptural forms in a way Brunelleschi never did. 

The New Sacristy is the only one of the artist s works in which 
the statues remain in the setting originally intended for them, 
although their exact placement remains problematic. 
Michelangelos plans for the Medici tombs underwent many 
changes while the work was under way. Other figures and reliefs 
for the project were designed but never executed. The present 
state of the Medici tombs can hardly be what Michelangelo 
ultimately intended, as the process was halted when the artist 
permanently left Florence for Rome in 1534. 

The tomb of Giuliano (fig. 17.5) remains an imposing visual 
unit, composed of a sarcophagus structure supporting two 
sculpted nudes above which sits an armored figure, all framed by 
Michelangelos inventive reimagining of Classical architecture. 
The central niche seems barely to accommodate the seated figure; 
paired pilasters flank the figure and support an entablature that 
breaks over them. The curving pediments over the blank windows 
on either side echo the shape of the sarcophagus below. A network 


of verticals and horizontals hold the triangle of statues in place; 
their slender, sharp-edged forms contrast with the roundness and 
weight of the sculpture. 

The design shows some kinship with such Early Renaissance 
tombs as Rossellino s tomb for Leonardo Bruni (see fig. 15.18), 
but the differences are marked. There is no outright Christian 
imagery no inscription, and the effigy has been replaced by two 
allegorical figures—Day on the right and Night on the left. Some 
lines penned on one of Michelangelo s drawings suggest what 
these figures mean: “Day and Night speak, and say: We with our 
swift course have brought the Duke Giuliano to death....It is only 
just that the Duke takes revenge [for] he has taken the light from 
us; and with his closed eyes has locked ours shut, which no longer 
shine on earth.” The reclining figures, themselves derived from 
ancient river-gods, contrast in mood: Day, whose face was left 
deliberately unfinished, seems to brood, while Night appears 
restless. Giuliano, the ideal image of the prince, wears classical 
military garb and bears no resemblance to the deceased. (“A thou¬ 
sand years from now, nobody will know what he looked like,”

Michelangelo is said to have remarked.) His beautifully propor¬ 
tioned figure seems ready for action, as he fidgets with his baton. 
His gaze was to be directed at the never-completed tomb of 
Lorenzo the Magnificent. Instead of a commemorative monu¬ 
ment that looks retrospectively at the accomplishments of the 
deceased, the tomb of Giuliano and the New Sacristy as a whole 
were to express the triumph of the Medici family over time. 

Michelangelos reimagining of Brunelleschi at the New 
Sacristy inspired Vasari to write that “all artists are under a great 
and permanent obligation to Michelangelo, seeing that he broke 
the bonds and chains that had previously confined them to the 
creation of traditional forms.” However, Michelangelo s full pow¬ 
ers as a creator of architectural forms are only really displayed for 
the first time in the vestibule to the Laurentian Library, which 
adjoins San Lorenzo. 

THE LAURENTIAN LIBRARY Clement VII commissioned 
this library (fig. 17.6) in 1523 to house, for the public, the huge 
collection of books and manuscripts belonging to the Medici fam¬ 
ily. Such projects display the Medici beneficence to the city and 
their encouragement of learning. The Laurentian Library is a long 
narrow hall that is preceded by the imposing vestibule, begun in 
1523 but not completed until much later. 

Judged by the standards of Bramante or Vitruvius, everything 
in the vestibule is wrong. The pediment above the door is broken. 
The pilasters defining the blank niches taper downward, and the 
columns belong to no recognizable order. The scroll brackets 
sustain nothing. Most paradoxical of all are the recessed columns. 
This feature flies in the face of convention. In the classical post- 
and-lintel system, the columns (or pilasters) and entablature must 


project from the wall in order to stress their separate identities, as 
they do in the Roman Temple of Portunus (see fig. 7.2). 
Michelangelo dared to defy the classical system by inserting 
columns into the wall. In the confined space of the entryway, the 
columns give the wall a monumental dignity without intruding 
into the vestibule. The grand staircase, designed later by 
Michelangelo and built by Bartolommeo Ammanati, activates the 
space through its cascading forms. 

THE UFFIZI, PALAZZO PITTI AND BOBOLI CARDENS 

In concentrating their patronage at San Lorenzo, this generation 
of Medici followed the patterns of the fifteenth century. But the 
Medici dukes were not content to live in the Palazzo Medici built 
by Michelozzo. The family of Cosimo I de 5 Medici moved into 
the Palazzo della Signoria in the center of the city in 1540 (see fig. 
13.15). Where earlier generations of Medici rulers separated their 
private residence from the seat of government, the new Medici 
dukes did what they could to unite them. Consequently, they had 
the interior of the former town hall remodeled to create a residen¬ 
tial space, and they built new areas for both court and government. 

To this end, Cosimo I de’ Medici commissioned a new build¬ 
ing to house the bureaucracies of his court in 1559. This project 
was assigned to Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574), the painter, historian, 
and architect. The building of the Uffizi, finished around 1580, 
consists of two long wings that face each other across a narrow 
court and are linked at one end by a loggia (fig. 17.7). Situated 
between the Palazzo della Signoria and the Arno River, it served 
to restructure both the city space and the widely dispersed 
Florentine ministries. Numerous windows and architectural 
moldings enliven the facades. Colonnades interrupted by piers at

regular intervals define the long facade at left; these units define 
spaces allotted for different bureaucracies. Although strongly 
marked by Michelangelo s architecture at San Lorenzo, the court¬ 
yard also makes reference to the Roman Forum and thus links 
Cosimo to Roman emperors. 

In their search for appropriate settings for the court, the 
Medici acquired the Palazzo Pitti, across the Arno River from the 
Uffizi, which had been built in the fifteenth century. The sculptor 
Bartolommeo Ammanati (1511-1592) enlarged the fifteenth- 
century palazzo with a courtyard between 1558 and 1570 (fig. 
17.8). Like Michelozzo s Medici palace (see fig. 15.32), this court¬ 
yard enframes a space that is both utilitarian and ceremonial; but 


where the fifteenth-century palace seems ornate and delicate, this 
courtyard has a fortresslike character. The three-story scheme of 
superimposed orders, derived from the Roman Colosseum (fig. 
7.20), has been overlaid with an extravagant pattern of rustication 
that “imprisons” the columns and reduces them to a passive role, 
despite the display of muscularity The creative combination of a 
classical vocabulary with the unorthodox treatment of the rusti¬ 
cation creates a raw expression of power. The Palazzo Pitti 
functions today as a museum displaying many of the works 
collected by the Medici family 

In addition to the new palace, the ducal family purchased 
a large area around it that they transformed into a carefully 



598 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 























landscaped park, called the Boboli Gardens (fig. 17.9). Begun 
around 1549, this continued to grow and change down to the 
nineteenth century. The architect Nicolo Triboli (1500-1550) 
laid out the original plan; he imposed a regular geometry on an 
uneven site, including long walkways lined by foliage, fountains 
and pools of water, and artificial grottoes. Later in the century, 
other artists, including Vasari and Ammanati, adjusted and altered 
the design. The dukes commissioned numerous sculptures for 
the gardens, too, often of mythological beings or Greek gods. The 
gardens provided scenic vistas for the residents of the palace, but 
also a grand stage setting for ducal events. 

PORTRAITURE AND ALLEGORY The Medici court had 
refined tastes and a good sense of how to use the visual arts to 
express their new status. As in the fifteenth century, the new gen¬ 
eration of Medici patrons used portraiture as a means to this end. 
The Portrait of Eleanor a of Toledo and Her Son Giovanni de’ 
Medici (fig. 17.10) by Agnolo Bronzino (1503-1572) exemplifies a 
new type of court portrait. This is a highly idealized painting of 
the wife of Cosimo I, who actually had blond hair (here dark¬ 
ened) and whose features have been perfected in the portrait. The 
portrait presents her as an ideal of beauty, just as her husband was 
admired for his virile good looks and courage.

An important message of the work is the continuity of the 
Medici dynasty, as Eleanoras arm enframes the male heir, 
Giovanni (born in 1543), who, however, would not outlive her. 
(She bore 11 children, including eight sons, before her death from 
tuberculosis in 1562 at about the age of 43.) This dynastic message 
is delivered by means of the formality of the portrait, with its 
frozen poses and aloof glances. Eleanora sits rigidly, with her arm 
resting on her silent, staring child; she wears a complicated bro¬ 
caded dress and jewelry that demonstrates her wealth and status. 
Bronzino depicts the pair almost like a Madonna and Child, sub¬ 
tly comparing Eleanora to the Virgin: This reference may account 
for the lightening of the blue background around Eleanora s face 
that suggests a halo. The image contains a complex set of allusions 
as flattering as the improvements to her looks. Bronzino s paint¬ 
ing describes the sitter as a member of an exalted social class, not 
as an individual personality. This kind of formal, distant, and allu¬ 
sive court portrait quickly became the ideal of court portraiture 
throughout Europe. (See, for example, fig. 18.26.) 

Bronzino was Eleanora s preferred painter and held a court 
appointment. His passion for drawing and his gift for poetry 
came together in many of his works. Nowhere is this better seen 
than in his Allegory ofVenus (fig. 17.11), which Duke Cosimo 
presented to Francis I of France. From these different sources, 


CHAPTER 1 7 THE LATE RENAISSANCE AND MANNERISM IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 599 




OURCE 


Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571) 



From The Autobiography 

The Florentine sculptor wrote his autobiography between 1558 and 
1566. Cellini's hook retells the story of his early life , training, and artis¬ 
tic triumphs. It was not published until the eighteenth century. This 
excerpt focuses on the design and reception of the saltcellar of Francis I 
(see fig. 17.12). Cellini took the advice of several courtiers in approach¬ 
ing the project , but ultimately made his own decision about what to 
render in the model. 

I made an oval shape the size of more than half an arms length—in 
fact, almost two thirds of an arms length—and on it, as if to show 
the Sea embracing the Land, I placed two nicely executed figures 
larger than a palm in size, seated with their legs intertwined in the 
same fashion as certain long-branched arms of the sea can be seen 
running into the land; and in the hand of the male figure of the Sea I 
placed a lavishly wrought ship, within which a great deal of salt could 
easily and well be accommodated; underneath this figure I placed 
four seahorses, and in the hand of this figure of the Sea I placed his 


Trident. The Land I had represented as a woman whose beautiful fig¬ 
ure was as full of as much loveliness and grace as I was able and knew 
how to produce, in whose hand I had placed a rich and lavishly dec¬ 
orated temple which rested upon the ground, and she was leaning on 
it with her hand; I had created the temple in order to hold the Pepper. 
I had placed a Horn of Plenty adorned with all the beautiful things I 
knew to exist in the world. Under this goddess and in the part that 
portrayed the earth, I had arranged all the most beautiful animals that 
the earth produces. Under the part devoted to the sea god I repre¬ 
sented all the beautiful kinds of fishes and small snails that tiny space 
could contain; in the widest part of the oval space I created many 
extremely rich decorations. ... I uncovered the model [before the 
King], and, amazed, the King said: "This is something a hundred 
times more divine than anything I might have imagined. This is a 
magnificent piece of work by this man. He should never stop work¬ 
ing. ” Then he turned to me with an expression full of delight, and told 
me that this was a work that pleased him enormously and that he 
wanted me to execute it in gold.

Bondanella (NY: Oxford University Press, 2002) 


Bronzino creates a complex allegory whose meanings art histori¬ 
ans are still probing. 

Into a narrow plane close to the surface of the painting, 
Bronzino crowds a number of figures who have been identified 
only tentatively: The bald Father Time tears back the curtain from 
Fraud, the figure in the upper left-hand corner, to reveal Venus 
and Cupid in an incestuous embrace, much to the delight of the 
child Folly, who is armed with roses, and to the dismay of a fig¬ 
ure tearing his hair, who has been identified as either Jealousy or 
Pain; on the right, Pleasure, half woman and half snake, offers a 
honeycomb. The moral of Bronzino s image may be that folly and 
pleasure blind one to the jealousy and fraud of sensual love, which 
time reveals. 

With its extreme stylization, Bronzino s painting proclaims a 
refined erotic ideal that reduces passion to a genteel exchange of 
gestures between figures as polished and rigid as marble. The lit¬ 
erary quality of the allegory reflects Bronzino s skill as a poet. The 
complexity of the conceit matches the complexity of the compo¬ 
sition; the high quality of the technique matches the cleverness of 
the content. In Bronzino, the Medici found an artist whose tech¬ 
nical virtuosity, complex imagery, and inventive compositions 
perfectly accorded with their taste and exemplify the Mannerist 
style. Cosimo s gift of a painting of such erudite imagery and 
accomplished technique to the king of France demonstrated his 
realm s achievements in the literary and visual arts. 

Such complex and learned treatments occur also in the work 
of Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571), a Florentine goldsmith and 
sculptor who owes much of his fame to his colorful autobiogra¬ 
phy. His gold saltcellar (fig. 17.12), made for the same king, 
Francis I, between 1540 and 1543, is his only important work in 
precious metal to survive. The main function of this lavish object

is clearly as a conversation piece. Because salt comes from the sea 
and pepper from the earth, the boat-shaped salt container is 
protected by Neptune. The pepper, in a tiny triumphal arch, is 
watched over by a personification of Earth who, in another con¬ 
text, might be the god s consort Amphitrite. On the base are 
figures representing the four seasons and the four parts of the day. 
Such references remind the viewer of the Medici tombs, as does 
the figure personifying Earth. Cellini wants to impress with his 
ingenuity and skill. In his autobiography (see Primary Source , 
page 600), he explained how he came to design the model for 
the saltcellar and its iconography. He had imagined the figure 
of the Earth as “a woman whose beautiful figure was as full of 
as much loveliness and grace as I was able and knew how to 
produce.” In true Mannerist fashion, the allegorical significance 
of the design is simply a pretext for this display of virtuosity. 
Cellini then modestly reports the reaction of Francis I to his 
design: “This is a magnificent piece of work by this man. He 
should never stop working. ” 

THE ACCADEMIA DEL DISEGNO One of the aims of the 
duke was to promote the arts in Tuscany, a goal shared by Giorgio 
Vasari, who had dedicated his collection of biographies, first pub¬ 
lished in 1550, to Cosimo I. Cosimo sponsored the establishment 
of the Accademia del Disegno (Academy of Design) in 1563, 
intended to improve the training of artists and to enhance the 
status of the arts. Bronzino and Giorgio Vasari were founding 
members. Training in the academy stressed drawing and the study 
of the human figure, which was deepened not only by life draw¬ 
ing but also by dissections. Both nature and the ancients were 
esteemed, and the art of Michelangelo was held to be the highest 
achievement of the moderns. The academy emphasized the study 
of history and literature as well as the skills of the artist. The 
specifically Tuscan emphasis on drawing ( disegno ) reflected the 
allegiances of the founders, who stressed art as an intellectual 
activity, not mere craft. 

To the academy came Jean Bologne (1529-1608), a gifted 
sculptor from Douai in northern France, who had encountered 
Italian styles at the court of Francis I. He found employment at 
the ducal court and, under the Italianized name of Giovanni 
Bologna, became the most important sculptor in Florence during 
the last third of the sixteenth century. To demonstrate his skill, he 
chose to sculpt what seemed to him a most difficult feat: three 
contrasting figures united in a single action. When creating the 
group, Bologna had no specific theme in mind, but when it was 
finished a member of the Florentine academy proposed the title 
The Rape of the Sabine Woman (fig. 17.13), which the artist 
accepted. The duke admired the work so much he had it installed 
near the Palazzo della Signoria. 

The subject proposed was drawn from the legends of ancient 
Rome. According to the story, the city’s founders, an adventurous 
band of men from across the sea, tried in vain to find wives among 
their neighbors, the Sabines. Finally, they resorted to a trick. 
Having invited the entire Sabine tribe into Rome for a festival, 
they attacked them, took the women away by force, and thus

Michelangelo the Poet 

Michelangelo’s prodigious creativity was manifested in many different 
art forms: sculpture , painting , architecture , poetry. Allusive and 

dense with imagery , his poems do not explain his works in visual medi¬ 
ums , they do sometimes treat parallel themes. This poem uses 
metaphors that appear visually in the Sistine ChapeTs The Last 
Judgment. It was a gifo to his friend and reported lover Tommaso 
Cavalieri , a Roman nobleman. 

The smith when forging iron uses fire 
to match the beauty shaped within his mind; 
and fire alone will help the artist find 


a way so to transmute base metal higher 
to turn it gold; the phoenix seeks its pyre 
to be reborn; just so I leave mankind 
but hope to rise resplendent, new refined, 
with souls whom death and time will never tire. 
And this transforming fire good fortune brings 
by burning out my life to make me new 
although among the dead I then be counted. 
True to its element the fire wings 
its way to heaven, and to me is true 
by taking me aloft where love is mounted.

ensured the future of their race. Bologna’s sculpture sanitizes 
what is an act of raw power and violence as the figures spiral 
upward in carefully rehearsed movements. Bologna wished to dis¬ 
play his virtuosity and saw his task only in formal terms: to carve 
in marble, on a massive scale, a sculptural composition that was to 
be seen from all sides. The contrast between form and content 
that the Mannerist tendency encouraged could not be clearer. 

ROME REFORMED 

While the Medici were consolidating their power in Florence, in 
Rome, popes Julius II and Leo X sought to join their religious 
authority with secular power. Naturally, conflicts arose between 
the papacy and the princes of Europe: The contest between the 
papacy and the Holy Roman Empire resulted in the Sack of Rome 
in 1527 by Habsburg troops. Pope Leo Xs cousin Clement VII 
fled, and much destruction ensued. Despite this shock to both the 
dignity of the city and the papacy, Clement ultimately crowned 
Charles V as emperor, and returned, once again, to his project of 
promoting the Medici family. When Clement died in 1534, the 
cardinals turned to a reform-minded member of a distinguished 
Roman family to restore the papacy’s reputation and power. They 
chose Alessandro Farnese, a childhood friend of Leo X who had 
been educated in the palace of Lorenzo the Magnificent. As Pope 
Paul III, he encouraged Charles Vs efforts to bring German 
princes back to the Roman Church, while at the same time trying 
to reassure Charles’s enemy, Francis I, that Germany would not 
overpower France. 

Paul III was very concerned by the spiritual crisis presented 
by the Reformation. Martin Luther had challenged both the doc¬ 
trine and the authority of the Church, and his reformed version of 
Christianity had taken wide hold in northern Europe (see Chapter 
18). To respond to the challenge of the Protestant Reformation, 
Paul III called the Council of Trent, which began its work in 1545 
and issued its regulations in 1564. The council reaffirmed tradi¬ 
tional Catholic doctrine and recommended reforms of liturgy, 
Church practices, and works of art. (See www.myartslab.com. ) 


The Catholic Church’s most far-reaching and powerful 
weapon for combating what it considered heresy was the 
Inquisition, established in Italy in 1562 to investigate unapproved 
or suspect religious activities. Those found guilty of engaging in 
such heresies (deviations from religious orthodoxy) could be 
imprisoned or executed. To further control the spread of 
unorthodoxy, the Church compiled an Index of Prohibited Books 
in 1557. Texts by suspect authors or on subjects deemed unhealth¬ 
ful could be seized or denied publication. 

Michelangelo in Rome 

Like his predecessors, Paul III saw the value in commissioning 
large-scale projects from the leading artists of his day. Thus, he 
recalled Michelangelo to Rome to execute several key projects for 
him. Rome remained Michelangelo’s home for the rest of his life. 
The new mood after the Sack of 1527 and during the Catholic 
Reformation may be reflected in the subject chosen for a major 
project in the Sistine Chapel. Beginning in 1534, Michelangelo 
painted for Paul III a powerful vision of The Last Judgment (fig. 
17.14). It took six years to complete the fresco, which was 
unveiled in 1541. 

To represent the theme of the Last Judgment (Matthew 
24:29-31) on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo 
had to remove not only the fifteenth-century frescoes commis¬ 
sioned by Sixtus IV but also parts of his own ceiling program in 
the upper lunettes. Traditional representations such as Giotto’s at 
the Arena Chapel in Padua (see fig. 13.18) depict Hell as a place 
of physical torment. In envisioning his fresco, Michelangelo must 
have looked partly to Luca Signorelli’s work at Orvieto Cathedral 
(see fig. 15.56), with its vigorous muscular nudes. Michelangelo 
replaces physical torments with spiritual agony expressed 
through violent contortions of the human body within a turbu¬ 
lent atmosphere. As angelic trumpeters signal the end of time, the 
figure of Christ sits at the fulcrum of a wheel of action: As he 
raises his arm, the dead rise from the earth at the lower left 
to yearn toward Heaven where the assembly of saints crowds 
about him. The damned plunge from Heaven toward Charon,

who ferries them to the underworld. (Some contemporary view¬ 
ers complained about the inclusion of a pagan character in a 
sacred subject.) Throughout the fresco, human figures bend, 
twist, climb, fall, or gaze at Christ, their forms almost superhu¬ 
man in their muscular power. The nudity of the figures, which 
expresses Michelangelo s belief in the sanctity of the human body, 
disturbed his contemporaries, and shortly after he died in 1564 
one of his assistants was commissioned to add bits of clothing 
to the fresco to mask the nudity The fresco was cleaned in 1994, 
bringing out the brilliant colors, the compressed space, and 
dramatic composition. These features link the work to the 
Mannerist style, though Michelangelo defies such labels. 

That the fresco expresses Michelangelo s personal vision of the 
end of days is suggested by one detail: Straddling a cloud just 
below the Lord is the apostle Bartholomew, holding a human skin 
to represent his martyrdom by flaying (fig. 17.15). The face on 
that skin, however, is not the saints, but Michelangelo s. In this 
grim self-portrait, so well hidden that it was recognized only in 
modern times, the artist represents himself as unworthy to be res¬ 
urrected in the flesh, which is a key theme of the image. Already 
in his sixties, Michelangelo frequently meditated on death and 
salvation in his poetry as well as in his art of the period. Some 


parallel ideas and metaphors may be seen in a poem he composed 
around 1532. (See Primary Source, page 603.) 

These concerns also appear in a new version of the Pieta, 
begun around 1546 (fig. 17.16). Here Michelangelo used his own 
features again, this time for the hooded figure—probably 
Nicodemus, who holds the broken body of Christ. He intended 
this sculptural group for his own tomb. By casting himself as a 
disciple tending the body of Christ, Michelangelo gives form to a 
conception of personal, unmediated access to the divine. The 
Catholic Church may have found such an idea threatening during 
the Catholic Reformation, when the authority of the Roman 
Church was being reaffirmed as Protestantism spread throughout 
Europe. For whatever reason, Michelangelo smashed the statue 
in 1555, and left it unfinished. Compared with his 1499 Pieta

(engraving by Etienne Duperac, 1569) 



(see fig. 16.12), this work is more expressive than conventionally 
beautiful, as though the ideals of his youth had been replaced by 
a greater seriousness of spiritual purpose. Many of Michelangelo’s 
last sculptures remained unfinished as his efforts turned to 
architecture. 

RESHAPING THE CAMPIDOGLIO While in Rome during the 
last 30 years of his life, Michelangelo’s main pursuit was architec¬ 
ture. Among his activities were several public works projects. In 
1537-39, he received the most ambitious commission of his 
career: to reshape the Campidoglio, the top of Romes Capitoline 
Hill, into a piazza and frame it with a monumental architectural 
ensemble worthy of the site, which once had been the symbolic 
center of the ancient city. This was an opportunity to plan on a 
grand scale. Pope Paul III worked with the civilian authorities in 
Rome (the Conservators) to renovate this site and made 
Michelangelo its designer. Although not completed until long 
after his death, the project was carried out essentially as 
Michelangelo designed it. The Campidoglio has since served as a 
model for many other civic centers. Pope Paul III transferred the 
equestrian monument of Marcus Aurelius (see fig. 7.33) from the 
Lateran Palace to the Campidoglio and had it installed on a base 
that Michelangelo designed. Placed at the top of a gently rising 
oval mound that defines the space, the statue became the focal 
point of the entire scheme. (The sculpture was recently removed 
to an interior space to protect it.) Since the sculpted figure was 
thought to represent Constantine, the first Roman emperor to 
promote Christianity and the source of the papacy’s claim to 
temporal power, by placing it at the center of the seat of secular 
government, the pope asserted papal authority in civic affairs. 

Palace facades define three sides of the piazza. An engraving 
based on Michelangelo’s design (fig. 17.17), conveys the effect, 
albeit imperfectly of the space created by the facades. The print 
shows the symmetry of the scheme and the sense of progression 
along the main axis toward the Senators’ Palace, opposite the 


staircase that gives entry to the piazza. However, the shape of 
the piazza is not a rectangle but a trapezoid, a peculiarity dictated 
by the site. The Senators’ Palace and the Conservators’ Palace on 
the right were older buildings that had to be preserved 
behind new exteriors, but they were placed at an angle of 80 
instead of 90 degrees. Michelangelo turned this problem into 
an asset. By adding the “New Palace” on the left, which comple¬ 
ments the Conservators’ Palace in style and placement, he makes 
the Senators’ Palace look larger than it is, so that it dominates 
the piazza. 

The whole conception has the appearance of a stage set. All 
three buildings are long but relatively narrow, like a show front 
with little behind it. However, these are not shallow screens but 
three-dimensional structures (fig. 17.18). The “New Palace” and 
its twin, the Conservators’ Palace, combine voids and solids, 
horizontals and verticals with a plasticity not found in any 
piece of architecture since Roman antiquity The open porticoes 
in each structure further link the piazza and facades, just as a 
courtyard is related to the arcades of a cloister. 

The columns and beams of the porticoes are contained in a 
colossal order of pilasters that supports a heavy cornice topped by 
a balustrade. Alberti had experimented with the colossal order at 
Sant’Andrea in Mantua (see fig. 15.45), but Michelangelo fully 
exploited this device. For the Senators’ Palace he used a colossal 
order and balustrade above a tall base, which emphasizes the 
massiveness of the building. The single entrance at the top of 
the double-ramped stairway (see fig. 17.17) seems to gather all the 
spatial forces set in motion by the oval mound and the flanking 
structures. It thus provides a dramatic climax to the piazza. 
Brunelleschi’s design for the facade of the Innocenti in Florence 
(see fig. 15.4), with its slim Tuscan columns and rhythmic arcade, 
seems a delicate frame for a piazza compared with the mass and 
energy of the Campidoglio. Michelangelo’s powerful example of 
molding urban spaces was important for subsequent city planners 
throughout Europe.

ST- PETER’S Michelangelo used the colossal order again on the 
exterior of St. Peters (fig. 17.19). Several architects had taken on 
the project after Bramantes death in 1514. Michelangelo took 
over the design of the church in 1546 upon the death of the pre¬ 
vious architect, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, whose work he 
completely recast. Returning to a centrally focused plan, he 
adapted the system of the Conservators’ Palace to the curving 
contours of the church, but with windows instead of open loggias 
and an attic instead of the balustrade. 

Unlike Bramantes many-layered elevation (see fig. 16.11), 
Michelangelo uses a colossal order of pilasters to emphasize the 
compact body of the structure, thus setting off the dome more 
dramatically. The same desire for compactness and organic unity 
led him to simplify the interior spaces (fig. 17.20). He brought the 
complex spatial sequences of Bramante s plan (see fig. 16.10) into 
one cross and square, held in check by the huge piers that support 
the central dome. He further defined its main axis by modifying 
the eastern apse and adding a portico to it, although this part of 
his design was never carried out. The dome, however, reflects 



1 7.20 Michelangelo. Plan for St. Peter’s 

Michelangelo s ideas in every important respect, even though it 
was built after his death and has a steeper pitch than he intended. 

Bramante had planned his dome as a stepped hemisphere 
above a narrow drum, which would have seemed to press down 
on the church. Michelangelo s, in contrast, has a powerful thrust 
that draws energy upward from the main body of the structure. 
Michelangelo borrowed not only the double-shell construction 
but also the Gothic profile from the Florence Cathedral dome (see 
fig. 15.3 and Materials and Techniques , page 512), yet the effect is 
very different. The smooth planes of Brunelleschi s dome give no 
hint of the internal stresses. Michelangelo, however, gives sculp¬ 
tured shape to these forces and visually links them to the rest of 
the building. The double columns of the high drum take up the 
vertical impetus of the colossal pilasters. This upward momentum 
continues in the ribs and the raised curve of the cupola, and then 
culminates in the tall lantern. The logic of this design is so persua¬ 
sive that almost all domes built between 1600 and 1900 were 
influenced by it. 


The Catholic Reformation and II Gesu 

Despite its visual logic and powerful design, Michelangelo s cen¬ 
tralized plan at St. Peters served as a model for few other 
churches in the era of the Catholic Reformation. As the Council 
of Trent finished its deliberations in 1564, the Church reasserted 
its traditions and reformed its liturgies. The council decreed that 
believers should see the elevation of the Host at the heart of the 
Mass, which was best accomplished in the long nave of a basilica 
with an unencumbered view of the altar. Despite its symbolic 
attractions, the centralized plan did not achieve this goal. 

Another result of the reform movement within the Catholic 
Church was the establishment of new religious orders. One of 
the most ambitious and energetic was the Society of Jesus, or 
Jesuits, founded by Ignatius of Loyola and promoted by Pope 
Paul III. He approved the order in 1540; by 1550, the Jesuits were 
planning their own church, II Gesu in Rome. Michelangelo once 
promised a design for this project, though he apparently never 
furnished it; the plan that the order adopted came from one of 
Michelangelo s assistants, Giacomo Vignola (1507-1573) in 1568. 
For Vignola s plan Giacomo della Porta (ca. 1540-1602) designed 
the facade. It was not completed until 1584. As the mother 
church of the Jesuits, its design must have been closely supervised 
so as to conform to the aims of the order. The Jesuits were at 
once intellectuals, mystics, and missionaries, whose charge was to 
fight heresy in Europe and spread Christianity to Asia and 
America. They required churches that adhered to the precepts of 
the Council of Trent—churches that would have impressive 
grand-eur while avoiding excessive ornament. Il Gesu may be 
seen as the architectural embodiment of the spirit of the Catholic 
Reformation. 

Il Gesu is a compact basilica dominated by its mighty nave 
(fig. 17.21). Chapels have replaced side aisles, thus assembling the 
congregation in one large, hall-like space directly in view of 
the altar. The attention of the audience is strongly directed 
toward altar and pulpit, as a representation of the interior shows 



17.21 Giacomo Vignola. Plan of II Gesu, Rome. 1568 


CHAPTER 1 7 THE LATE RENAISSANCE AND MANNERISM IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY ITALY 607 









(fig. 17.22). (The painting depicts how the church would look 
from the street if the center part of the facade were removed. For 
the later decoration of the nave vault, see fig. 19.12.) The painting 
also depicts a feature that the ground plan cannot show: the 
dramatic contrast between the dim nave and the amply lighted 
eastern part of the church, thanks to the large windows in the 
drum of the dome. Light has been consciously exploited for its 
expressive possibilities—a novel device, theatrical in the best sense 
of the term—to give II Gesu a stronger emotional focus than we 
have as yet found in a church interior. 

The facade by Giacomo della Porta (fig. 17.23) is as bold as the 
plan. It is divided into two stories by a strongly projecting entab¬ 
lature that is supported by paired pilasters that clearly derive from 
Michelangelo, with whom Della Porta had worked. The same pat¬ 
tern recurs in the upper story on a somewhat smaller scale, with 
four instead of six pairs of supports. To bridge the difference in 
width and hide the roof line, Della Porta inserted two scroll¬ 
shaped buttresses. This device, taken from the facade of Santa 
Maria Novella in Florence by Alberti (see fig. 15.9), forms a 
graceful transition to the large pediment crowning the facade, 
which retains the classic proportions of Renaissance architecture: 
The height equals the width. 

Della Porta has masterfully integrated all the parts of the 
facade into a single whole: Both stories share the same vertical 
rhythm, which even the horizontal members obey. (Note the way 
the broken entablature responds to the pilasters.) In turn, the

horizontal divisions determine the size of the vertical members, so 
there is no colossal order. Michelangelo inspired the sculptural 
treatment of the facade, which places greater emphasis on the 
main portal. Its double frame—two pediments resting on coupled 
pilasters and columns—projects beyond the rest of the facade and 
gives strong focus to the entire design. Not since Gothic architec¬ 
ture has the entrance to a church received such a dramatic concen¬ 
tration of features. This facade, and the freedom to add movement 
and plastic dimension to it, set an important precedent for church 
architecture by the Jesuits and others during ensuing centuries. 

NORTHERN ITALY: DUCAL COURTS 
AND URBAN CENTERS 

Northern Italy was divided into a number of principalities that 
were smaller than the Grand Duchy of Tuscany or the Papal 
States. One of the most stable of these principalities was Mantua, 
where the Gonzaga family retained the title of marquis into the 
sixteenth century. Mantua was host to major artists in the 
fifteenth century, including Alberti and Mantegna. The family’s 
traditions of patronage extended to women as well as men, as 
Isabella d’Este, the wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, was one of the 
most active patrons of the early sixteenth century. Her son, 
Federico, became marquis in 1519, a title he held until Charles V 
named him duke in 1530. To impress the emperor, Federico 
displayed his wealth and taste expressed through the arts. 

The Palazzo del Te 

As part of his display, Federico II Gonzaga commissioned Giulio 
Romano (ca. 1499-1546) to design a villa for him outside the city 


itself, called the Palazzo del Te, where he could house his mistress 
and receive the emperor. Giulio had been Raphael s chief assistant 
in Rome, but came to Mantua to follow in the footsteps of 
Mantegna and Alberti in 1524. 

He designed the Palazzo del Te as a low structure appropriate 
to the flat landscape. For the courtyard facade (fig. 17.24), Giulio 
used a vocabulary familiar to patrons of villas and palaces, such as 
the rusticated blocks and the smooth Tuscan order of engaged 
columns that support the projecting entablature. As Michelangelo 
did at the Faurentian Fibrary, Giulio subverts the conventions of 
traditional classical architecture. The massive keystones of the 
blank windows appear ready to burst the triangular lintels above 
them. The only true arch spans the central doorway, but a pedi¬ 
ment surmounts it—a violation of the classical canon. The 
triglyph midway between each pair of columns “slips” downward 
in defiance of all logic and accepted practice, thereby creating a 
sense that the frieze might collapse before our eyes. In a 
Mannerist display, Giulio broke the rules of accepted practice as 
if to say that the rules did not apply to him, or to his patron. 

What is merely a possibility on the exterior of the Palazzo 
del Te seems to be fully realized in the interior, where Giulio 
painted a series of rooms with illusionistic frescoes on themes 
drawn from antiquity. Unlike the frescoes of Raphael in Rome, 
these are not images of a distant and beautiful Golden Age, but 
vivid and dramatic expressions of power. In the Sala dei Giganti 
(Room of the Giants) (fig. 17.25), Giulio painted a fresco of the 
gods expelling the giants from Mount Olympus as a cataclysm of 
falling bodies and columns. A viewer seems to see an entire 
temple collapsing. Figures of the winds in the upper corners of 
the wall appear to topple architectural elements onto the huge 
figures of giants, crushing them. As if witnessing the power of 
the new Olympian gods, a viewer feels transported into the terror

of the event. Of course, the duke himself was imagined as Zeus 
(Jupiter) in this conceit, so the whole illusion speaks to the power 
of Duke Federico. 

This conceit was also applied to paintings for the same duke s 
palace in Mantua, which he commissioned from Antonio Allegri 
da Correggio (1489/94-1534), called Correggio, about the same 
time. This gifted northern Italian painter, who spent most of his 
brief career in Parma, absorbed the influences of Leonardo, the 
Venetians, Michelangelo, and Raphael into a distinctive and sen¬ 
sual style. Duke Federico commissioned a series of the Loves of 
Jupiter, among which is the Jupiter and Io (fig. 17.26). As Ovid 
recounts, Jupiter changed his shape numerous times to seduce his 
lovers; here, the nymph Io, swoons in the embrace of a cloudlike 
Jupiter. The use of Leonardesque sfumato, combined with a 
Venetian sense of color and texture, produces a frank sensuality 
that exceeds even Titians Bacchanal (see fig. 16.31). Correggio 
renders the vaporous form of the god with a remarkable degree of 
illusionism. The eroticism of the image reflects a taste shared by

many of the courts of Europe, visible in Bronzino s Allegory of 
Venus (see fig. 17.11) and Titians Rape of Euro pa (see fig. 17.36). 

PARMA AND CREMONA 

The larger political entities in Italy aimed to swallow up the 
smaller ones. The Papal States expanded to include cities like 
Bologna and Parma, while the Duchy of Milan gobbled up the 
city of Cremona. Forms of art and patronage established by 
courts in Rome, Florence, and Milan were emulated by the citi¬ 
zens of these cities. 


Correggio and Parmigianino in Parma 

Correggio spent much of his career in the city of Parma, which had 
recently been absorbed into the Papal States. This new affiliation 
brought the city new wealth and inspired local patrons of art and 
architecture; more than once Correggio was the artist chosen for 
their projects. He put his skills to work in the dome of Parma Cath¬ 
edral where he painted the fresco of The Assumption of the Virgin 
between 1522 and 1530 (fig. 17.27). The surfaces of the dome are 
painted away by Correggio s illusionistic perspective. A viewer 
standing below the dome is transported into the heavens, as the 
sky opens to receive the body of the Virgin rising into the light.

Correggio here initiates a new kind of visionary representa¬ 
tion in which Heaven and earth are joined visually and spiritually 
through the magic of perspective and the artist s skill. Not since 
Mantegnas Camera Picta in Mantua (see fig. 15.50) has a ceiling 
been so totally replaced by a painted illusion; the concept would 
reverberate in the works of other artists in the seventeenth cen¬ 
tury, when ceilings would disappear through illusionistic devices, 
as can be seen in the work of Pietro da Cortona (see fig. 19.11) and 
Giovanni Battista Gaulli (see fig. 19.12). Correggio also gave the 
figures themselves the ability to move with such exhilarating ease 
that the force of gravity seems not to exist for them, and they 
frankly delight in their weightless condition. Reflecting the influ¬ 
ence of Titian, these are healthy, energetic beings of flesh and blood, 
which makes the Assumption appear that much more miraculous. 

Parma was the birthplace of yet another gifted painter, 
Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola (1503-1540), known as 
Parmigianino. Precocious and intelligent, Parmigianino had made 
his reputation as a painter in Rome, Florence, and elsewhere 
before returning to Parma in 1530. His Self-Portrait (fig. 17.28), 
done as a demonstration piece, suggests his self-confidence. The 
artists appearance is bland and well groomed. The features, 
painted with Raphael s smooth perfection, are veiled by a delicate 
sfumato. The picture records what Parmigianino saw as he gazed 
at his reflection in a convex mirror, including the fishbowl distor¬ 
tions in his hand. Parmigianino substitutes his painting for the 
mirror itself, even using a specially prepared convex panel. The 
painting demonstrates his skill at recording what the eye sees, yet 
at the same time it shows off his learning by a subtle allusion to 
the myth of Narcissus, who, according to Greek legend, looked in 
a pool of water and fell in love with his own reflection. 


Parmigianino s skill is evident in his most famous work, The 
Madonna with the Long Neck (fig. 17.29), commissioned in 1535 
by a noblewoman of Parma for a family chapel in the church of 
Santa Maria dei Servi. Despite his deep study of Raphael and 
Correggio, Parmigianino has a different ideal of beauty, which he 
establishes with the large amphora offered by the figure at the left. 
In his painting, the perfect oval of Mary s head rests on a swanlike 
neck, while her body swells only to taper to her feet, which 
mimics the shape of the amphora. By contrast, Raphael s La Belle 
Jardiniere (see fig. 16.22) seems all circles and cubes, and her 
features are sweet rather than haughty. Nor does Parmigianino 
attempt to replicate Raphaels stable compositions. Here, the

sleeping Christ Child balances precariously on the Madonna s lap, 
as she lifts a boneless hand to her breast. The composition is as 
unbalanced as the postures: heavily weighted to the left, open and 
distant to the right. All the figures have elongated limbs and 
ivory-smooth features, and the space is compressed. In typical 
Mannerist fashion, these elements draw attention to the artist s 
skill and his inversion of Raphael s ideals. 

These choices may reflect the meaning of the image. The large 
Christ Child in his mother s lap recalls the theme of the Pieta, 
which implies that Jesus is already aware of his fate. Nor is the set¬ 
ting as arbitrary as it may seem. The gigantic column is a symbol 
often associated with the Madonna as the gateway to Heaven and 
eternal life, as well as the Immaculate Conception. At the same time 
it may also refer to the column on which Jesus endured the flagel¬ 
lation during the Passion, which the tiny figure of a prophet fore¬ 
tells on his scroll. The Madonna with the Long Neck , with its cold 
and memorable elegance, offers a vision of unearthly perfection. 

Cremona 

The Mannerist elegance that Correggio and Parmigianino 
achieved was but one stylistic option that artists and patrons of 
northern Italy could select. The work of Sofonisba Anguissola 



1 7.30 Sofonisba Anguissola, Self-Portrait, c. 1556. Oil on parchment,

Fund, 1960. 60.155 


(1532-1625) of Cremona represents a different approach. The 
daughter of a nobleman in that north Italian city, Sofonisba 
received her training in painting as a professional. This was a very 
unusual circumstance, as most women artists of the Renaissance 
learned their craft at home as the daughters of artists. Sofonisba 
became famous in Italy as a painter, communicating with artists 
all over the peninsula, including Michelangelo and Vasari. Her 
fame was such that Philip II of Spain hired her as his court artist. 
She moved to Spain in 1559 where she executed mostly portraits 
of imperial family members. She remained there until she married 
in 1573 and returned to Italy. 

The reasons for her fame become clear in examining her self- 
portrait of about 1556 (fig. 17.30). Executed as a miniature, the 
portrait was probably a gift. In the image, the 24-year-old artist 
represents herself staring out at the spectator wearing sober black 
costume and with respectably plaited hair. Sofonisba does not 
attempt the showy distortions that appear in Parmigianinos 
comparable self-portrait, done in 1524 (see fig. 17.28), preferring 
a straightforward naturalism to Mannerist display. She holds a 
medallion with a still mysterious monogram. (It may be an ana¬ 
gram of her father s name, although this is not certain.) Around 
the medallion she claims the image as a work “by her hand done 
with the aid of a mirror. ” In the miniature, Sofonisba has wittily 
placed her hands next to the words “by whose hand” (ipsius manu 
ex ), so stressing the skill of her hands. 

VENICE: THE SERENE REPUBLIC 

Despite the attacks it endured at the beginning of the sixteenth 
century, Venice regained much of its territory and wealth by 1529. 
Its aristocracy reasserted its political and cultural power through¬ 
out the century, contributing to a distinctive situation for artists 
and for patrons. Instead of a court, Venice remained a nominal 
republic, controlled by ancient families, such as the Loredan, the 
Vendramin, and the Barbaro. In addition to religious works of art, 
these families commissioned works for their homes in town and 
for their villas in the country, so artists had a wide variety of 
themes to depict. The city itself expressed its status through 
public works projects commissioned by the civic fathers and 
intended to beautify the Most Serene Republic ( Serenissima ). One 
example of this is the refashioning of the heart of the city—the 
piazzetta between the cathedral of San Marco and the Canal of 
San Marco—with a pair of buildings in the 1530s. 

Sansovino in Venice 

The Council of Ten, who controlled the city, held a competition 
in 1535 to design a new home for the state mint (fig. 17.31, left). 
They selected Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570), a Florentine sculp¬ 
tor who left Rome for Venice after the Sack of Rome in 1527 and 
established himself as the city’s chief architect. Not surprisingly, 
his buildings are sculptural in character. In the spirit of earlier 
Venetian structures such as the Ca’ d’Oro (see fig. 15.51) and the

17.31 Jacopo Sansovino. Mint (left) and Library of St. Marks, Venice. Begun ca. 1535-37 


Doges Palace (see fig. 13.32) nearby, Sansovino composed the 
facade to have numerous openings formed by arches and huge 
windows. The supporting arches and columns, however, are given 
greater stress by means of the rustication used throughout, which 
adds to the imposing effect of the building. (The top story was 
added around 1560.) 

The Procurators of San Marco then hired Sansovino to build 
the Library of San Marco (see fig. 17.31, right) as a public library 
and repository for a rich collection of Greek and Latin manu¬ 
scripts. Situated next to the mint, the library uses a much more 
elegant architectural vocabulary. It is a long, two-storied struc¬ 
ture, composed as a series of arcades supporting heavy cornices. 
The street-level arcade is enframed by a Roman Doric order 
inspired by the Colosseum, while the upper story shows an elab¬ 
orate treatment of the Ionic order (including triple engaged 
columns) surmounted by a garlanded entablature. A balustrade 
caps off the structure, with life-size statues over every column 
cluster and obelisks at each corner. The extravagant ornamenta¬ 
tion of both structures creates an effect of opulence that proclaims 
the Venetian republic as a new Rome. 


Andrea Palladio and Late Renaissance 
Architecture 

Venice built many churches as well as civic buildings. The com¬ 
mission for San Giorgio Maggiore was awarded to one of the 
most influential architects of the Renaissance, Andrea Palladio 
(1508-1580), in 1565. Although Palladio s career centered on his 
native Vicenza, a town near Venice, his buildings and theoretical 
writings brought him international renown. Palladio believed that 
architecture should be governed by reason and by rules exempli¬ 
fied by the buildings of the ancients. He shared Leon Battista 
Albertis faith in the significance of proportion. (See Primary 
Source , page 616.) The two architects differed in how they related 
theory to practice, however. With Alberti, the relationship had 
been flexible, whereas Palladio believed quite literally in practic¬ 
ing what he preached. This view stemmed in part from his earlier 
career as a stonemason and sculptor before entering the humanist 
circles of Count Giangiorgio Trissino of Vicenza, where he stud¬ 
ied Vitruvius and other ancient authors and was introduced to 
elite patrons of the Veneto. 


614 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 

















His first great project in Venice itself was the Benedictine 
church of San Giorgio Maggiore (fig. 17.32), begun in 1565. Like 
his predecessors, Palladio declared that round temples are ideal 
because the circle is a symbol of uniformity and eternity; yet he 
and his patrons chose a basilican plan as the only one appropriate 
for Christian worship. The plan for San Giorgio Maggiore (fig. 
17.33) reflects the churchs twofold purpose of serving a 
Benedictine monastery and a lay congregation. The main body of 
the church is strongly centralized—the transept is as long as the 
nave and a dome marks the crossing—but the longitudinal axis 
reasserts itself in the separate compartments for the main altar and 
the large choir beyond, where the monks worshiped. On the 
facade, Palladio wished to express the dignity of the church by 
using the architectural language of the ancients. He designed a 
flattened-out temple porch for the entrance on the grounds that 
“Temples ought to have ample porticos, and with larger columns 
than other buildings require; and it is proper that they should be 
great and magnificent...and built with large and beautiful propor¬ 
tions. They must be made of the most excellent and the most 
precious material, that the divinity may be honored as much as 
possible.” To achieve this end, Palladio superimposed a tall, 


narrow temple front on another low, wide one to reflect the 
different heights of nave and aisles in the basilica itself. The inter¬ 
locking design is held together by the four gigantic columns, 
which function as a variant of Alberti s colossal order. 

Much of Palladio s architecture consists of town houses and 
country villas. The Villa Rotonda (fig. 17.34), one of Palladio s 
finest buildings, exemplifies his interpretation of the ancients. 
This country residence, built near Vicenza, beginning in 1567, for 
the humanist cleric Paolo Almerico, consists of a square block 
surmounted by a dome, with identical porches in the shape of 
temple fronts on all four sides. Alberti had defined the ideal 
church as a symmetrical, centralized design of this sort; Palladio 
adapted the same principles for the ideal country house. He was 
convinced, on the basis of his reading of Vitruvius and Pliny, that 
Roman private houses had porticoes like these. (Excavations have 
since proved him mistaken.) Palladio s use of the temple front 
here is more than an expression of his regard for antiquity; he 
considered this feature both legitimate and essential for deco¬ 
rum—namely, appropriateness, beauty, harmony, and utility— 
befitting the houses of “great men. ” This concept was embedded 
in the social outlook of the later sixteenth century, which required

OURCE 


Andrea Palladio (1508-1580) 



From The Four Books on Architecture 

Published in 1570, Palladio's Four Books on Architecture made an 
enormous impression on his European contemporaries, providing the 
basis for much French and English architecture of the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. 



O ne must describe as suitable a house which will be appropriate 
to the status of the person who will have to live in it and of 
which the parts will correspond to the whole and to each other. But 
above all the architect must observe that (as Vitruvius says in Books 
I and VI), for great men and especially those in public office, houses 
with loggias and spacious, ornate halls will be required, so that those 
waiting to greet the master of the house or to ask him for some help 
or a favor can spend their time pleasantly in such spaces; similarly, 
smaller buildings of lesser expense and ornament will be appropriate 
for men of lower status. One must build in the same way for judges 
and lawyers ... Merchants’ houses should have places for storing their 


goods which face north and are so arranged that the owners have no 
fear of burglars. A building will also have decorum, if the parts 
correspond to the whole ... 

So we read that when building temples the ancients used every 
ingenuity to maintain decorum, which is one of the most beautiful 
aspects of architecture. Therefore, to maintain decorum in the shapes 
of our temples, we too, who have no false gods, should choose the 
most perfect and excellent one; and because the round form would be 
just that, as it alone amongst all the plans is simple, uniform, equal, 
strong, and capacious, let us build temples round; this form is far and 
away the most appropriate for them, because it is enclosed by only 
one boundary in which the beginning and the end ... cannot be found 
... and since at every point the outer edge is equidistant from the 
center, it is perfectly adapted to demonstrate the unity, the infinite 
existence, the consistency and the justice of God. ... recommended 
too are churches that are made in the shape of a cross ... because ... 
they represent, in the eyes of onlookers, that wood from which our 
Salvation was hung.

the display of great wealth and taste to assert status. Palladio s 
design also takes advantage of the pleasing views offered in every 
direction by the site. Beautifully correlated with the walls behind 


and the surrounding vistas, the porches of the Villa Rotonda give 
the structure an air of serene dignity and festive grace that is 
enhanced by the sculptures on the facades.

616 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 


























His buildings alone would make Palladio an important figure 
in the history of art, but his influence extended beyond Italy, 
indeed beyond Europe, through his publications. Palladio s most 
important work in this field was his 1570 work, The Four Books 
on Architecture (excerpted in the Primary Source , page 616). While 
several architects, including Alberti, had written treatises in the 
fifteenth century, sixteenth-century printed books on architecture 
by Sebastiano Serlio and Palladio became bestsellers. Palladio s 
treatise was more practical than Alberti s, which may account for 
its great popularity among architects, and his many buildings are 
linked more directly with his theories. Some have claimed that 
Palladio designed only what was, in his view, sanctioned by 
ancient precedent. Indeed, the usual term for both Palladio s work 
and theoretical attitude is classicizing. This term denotes a con¬ 
scious striving for qualities found in ancient art, although the 
results may not look like ancient works. Whenever later architects 
sought to express ideas through ancient forms, they consulted 
Palladios Four Books. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, once 
referred to it as “the bible” and based several of his designs for 
buildings on its examples (see fig. 24.33). Such treatises, with their 
rules for designing beautiful buildings, formulas for correct 
proportion, and extensive drawings, including ground plans and 
elevations in woodcut, were a treasure trove for architects else¬ 
where in Europe and later throughout the world. 


Titian 

Titian (1485-1576) dominated painting in Venice throughout the 
sixteenth century. Like Michelangelo, he lived a long life, and he 
had numerous pupils to spread his ideas and techniques. His fame 
was such that by the 1530s his work was sought by the most elite 
patrons of Europe. For example, in 1538, Titian was commis¬ 
sioned by the duke of Urbino, Guidobaldo II della Rovere, to 
execute the so-called Venus of Urbino (fig. 17.35). The painting, 
based on models by Giorgione, depicts a nude young woman 
lying on a bed in a well-furnished chamber. In the background, 
two women search in a cassone (or wedding chest) for something, 
perhaps for a garment. Details such as the presence of the cassone 
and the little dog have led some scholars to suggest that this may 
have been an image intended to celebrate a marriage (the dog 
representing faithfulness). However, the owner referred to the 
picture only as “the naked woman.” Titians use of color records 
the sensuous textures of the womans body, which has been placed 
on display for a viewer whose gaze she meets. It may have been 
intended as an erotic image, not a classical theme. 

Whether or not this is Venus, the sensuously depicted female 
nude became a staple product of Titian s workshop, which was 
supported by the patronage of other powerful men. For Phillip II 
of Spain (the son of Charles V), whom he met in 1548, Titian

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Oil on Canvas 

F or much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, painters worked 
either directly on walls or on solid wood supports. Wood panels 
were formed of planks that had to be attached together, so seams are 
sometimes visible. While durable, wood is also heavy and susceptible 
to warping. In the fifteenth century, some artists both in Italy and in 
northern Europe painted on cloth supports, usually canvas or linen, as 
a less expensive substitute for wood. Canvas is also lighter, and more 
easily portable. Painted canvases from Flanders, called panni dipinti, 
were imported in good numbers to Italy. 

In the humid climate of Venice, where neither fresco nor wood pan¬ 
els would easily survive, artists preferred to work on canvas supports, 
especially on large-scale projects. By the middle of the sixteenth cen¬ 
tury, canvas began to replace wood as the support of choice. By 1 600, 
most patrons, who were not commissioning frescoes, preferred oil on 
canvas. Once the canvas itself had been stretched on a wooden frame¬ 
work, the artist would cover it with a gluelike material to seal the 
fibers. Then several priming coats would be applied and allowed to dry 
before painting commenced. 

Working on a large scale also inspired Venetian painters to experi¬ 
ment with the oil medium itself. Instead of building up layers of tinted 
glazes over large surfaces, artists loaded the brush with more opaque

color and laid it on with broad strokes. Sometimes the thick paint 
looked pastelike, a technique called impasto. In such cases, the sur¬ 
face does not have a mirrorlike smoothness, but is rough and catches 
the light unevenly. Titian is one of the innovators of this technique. His 
example was the inspiration for the painterly artists of the Baroque, 
including Rubens, Rembrandt, and Velazquez.

made a series of images of the Loves of Jupiter based on the 
Roman poet Ovid’s Metamorphoses. There, Ovid recounted the 
story of the princess beguiled by Jupiter who had taken the shape 
of a white bull to avoid his wife’s jealous gaze; this tale inspired 
Titians Rape of Euro pa, finished by 1562 (fig. 17.36). The poet 
says that the young woman admired the bull, whom she encoun¬ 
tered on the seashore. When she climbed onto the beast, the god 
swam away with her, her veil fluttering behind her as she clung to 
his horn. Titian’s painting takes up the story at its climax, as the 
bull moves away from land, leaving Europa’s companions to wave 
ineffectually on the shore. 

In Titian’s painting, Europa can barely hold on to the ener¬ 
getic animal. Titian uses rich colors and swirling movement to 
heighten the sensuous forms and to create an atmospheric setting 
for the events. His brushwork is very free, to the point that the 


forms are barely defined. This effect is enhanced by his use of the 
impasto technique. (See Materials and Techniques , page 618.) The 
sharp disjunction between foreground and background empha¬ 
sizes the main figures’ distance from land and adds drama. Such 
images of sensuous interaction between gods and mortals offered 
artists like Titian an opportunity to compete with poets. 
Contemporaries called these images poesie , just as they did the 
works of Giorgione (see page 584). 

Titian experimented with many different forms, including 
prints, but his most enduring innovations were in the technique of 
painting on canvas. His late works demonstrate his freest brush- 
work. Titian intended the Pieta (fig. 17.37) for his own tomb in 
the Franciscan church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari; incom¬ 
plete at his death in 1576, it was finished by one of his students. 
Like Michelangelo’s late Pieta (see fig. 17.16), Titian depicts the

OURCE 


From a Session of the Inquisition Tribunal in Venice of 
Paolo Veronese 



Because of the liberal religious atmosphere of Venice , Veronese was 
never required to make the various changes to his painting of the Last 
Supper (see fig. 17.38) asked for by the tribunal of the Inquisition in this 
interrogation. All parties seem to have been satisfied with a mere change 
of title to The Feast in the House of Levi. 

T oday, Saturday, the 18th of the month of July, 1573, having been 
asked by the Holy Office to appear before the Holy Tribunal, 
Paolo Caliari of Verona questioned about his profession: 

a: I paint and compose figures. 

q: Do you know the reason why you have been summoned? 
a: No, sir. 

q: Can you imagine it? 

a: I can well imagine. 

q: Say what you think the reason is. 

a: According to what the Reverend Father, the Prior of the Convent 
of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, told me, he had been here and Your 
Lordships had ordered him to have painted [in the picture] a 
Magdalen in place of a dog. I answered him by saying I would 
gladly do everything necessary for my honor and for that of my 
painting, but that I did not understand how a figure of Magdalen 
would be suitable there. 

q: What picture is this of which you have spoken? 
a: This is a picture of the Last Supper that Jesus Christ took with His 
Apostles in the house of Simon. 
q: At this Supper of Our Lord have you painted other figures? 
a: Yes, milords. 

q: Tell us how many people and describe the gestures of each. 
a: There is the owner of the inn, Simon; besides this figure I have 
made a steward, who, I imagined, had come there for his own 
pleasure to see how things were going at the table. There are many 
figures there which I cannot recall, as I painted the picture some 
time ago. 

q: In this Supper which you made for SS. Giovanni e Paolo what is 
the significance of the man whose nose is bleeding? 
a: I intended to represent a servant whose nose was bleeding because 
of some accident. 

q: What is the significance of those armed men dressed as Germans, 
each with a halberd in his hand? 

a: We painters take the same license the poets and the jesters take and 
I have represented these two halberdiers, one drinking and the 
other eating nearby on the stairs. They are placed there so that 
they might be of service because it seemed to me fitting, according 
to what I have been told, that the master of the house, who was 
great and rich, should have such servants. 


q: And that man dressed as a buffoon with a parrot on his wrist, for 
what purpose did you paint him on that canvas? 
a: For ornament, as is customary. 
q: Who are at the table of Our Lord? 
a: The Twelve Apostles. 
q: What is St. Peter, the first one, doing? 

a: Carving the lamb in order to pass it to the other end of the 
table. 

q: What is the Apostle next to him doing? 

a: He is holding a dish in order to receive what St. Peter will give 
him. 

q: Tell us what the one next to this one is doing. 
a: He has a toothpick and cleans his teeth. 

q: Did anyone commission you to paint Germans, buffoons, and 
similar things in that picture? 

a: No, milords, but I received the commission to decorate the picture 
as I saw fit. It is large and, it seemed to me, it could hold many 
figures. 

q: Are not the decorations which you painters are accustomed to add 
to paintings or pictures supposed to be suitable and proper to the 
subject and the principal figures or are they for pleasure—simply 
what comes to your imagination without any discretion or 
judiciousness? 

a: I paint pictures as I see fit and as well as my talent permits. 
q: Does it seem fitting at the Last Supper of the Lord to paint buf¬ 
foons, drunkards, Germans, dwarfs, and similar vulgarities? 
a: No, milords. 

q: Do you not know that in Germany and in other places infected 
with heresy it is customary with various pictures full of 
scurrilousness and similar inventions to mock, vituperate, and 
scorn the things of the Holy Catholic Church in order to teach 
bad doctrines to foolish and ignorant people? 
a: Yes, that is wrong. 

After these things had been said, the judges announced that the above 
named Paolo would be obliged to improve and change his painting 
within a period of three months from the day of this admonition 
and that according to the opinion and decision of the Holy Tribunal 
all the corrections should be made at the expense of the painter and 
that if he did not correct the picture he would be liable to the penal¬ 
ties imposed by the Holy Tribunal. Thus they decreed in the best 
manner possible.

seem to consist wholly of light and color. The artist applies the 
color in thick masses of paint, yet despite this heavy impasto, the 
surfaces have lost every trace of material solidity. The gesture of 
Mary Magdalen and the sorrow in the features of the Virgin add 
poignancy to the scene. A kneeling figure, possibly St. Jerome, 
stands in for Titian himself and reaches over to touch the body of 
Christ in reverence. The quiet, almost resigned mood is enhanced 
by the painting s ethereal forms. 

Titian’s Legacy 

Titian s creative output and reputation drew many artists to work 
in his workshop, but he had a tremendous influence even on those 
who did not. From the island of Crete (then controlled by 
Venice), the young Domenikos Theotokopoulos, called El Greco, 
came to study in Titians shop before heading to Spain (see 
Chapter 18). The two leading painters in Venice after Titian, 
Veronese and Tintoretto, developed in different directions. Where 
Veronese made images that depended on early Titian works such 
as the Pesaro Madonna (see fig. 16.32) and aimed for naturalism, 
Tintoretto exploited the drama and fluid brushwork of Titian s 
later work, like the Piet a. 

PAOLO VERONESE The paintings of Paolo Cagliari 
(1528-1588), called Paolo Veronese, who was born and trained in 
Verona, start from the naturalism inherent in Titian s style, but 
add an interest in details of everyday reality, as seen in animals, 
textiles, and foodstuffs—and in grand architectural frameworks. 


In his huge canvas The Feast in the House of Levi (fig. 17.38), 
Veronese avoids any reference to the mystical. His symmetrical 
composition harks back to paintings by Leonardo and Raphael, 
while the festive mood of the scene reflects examples by Titian 
of the 1520s, so that at first glance the picture looks like a High 
Renaissance work born 50 years too late. Veronese, however, 
is less interested than Leonardo in conveying spiritual or 
psychological depth. Originally commissioned for the refectory 
of a Dominican monastery, the painting depicts a sumptuous 
banquet, a true feast for the eyes. As with his contemporaries 
elsewhere in Italy, Veronese was deliberately vague about which 
event from the life of Jesus he originally meant to depict. He gave 
the painting its present title only after he had been summoned 
by the religious tribunal of the Inquisition on the charge of filling 
his picture with “buffoons, drunkards, Germans, dwarfs, and 
similar vulgarities” unsuited to its theme. The account of the trial 
shows that the tribunal thought any such representation of 
the Last Supper irreverent. (See Primary Source , page 620.) In the 
face of their questions, Veronese therefore settled on a different 
title— T he Feast in the House of Levi —which permitted him to 
leave the offending incidents in place. He argued that they were 
no more objectionable than the nudity of Jesus and the Heavenly 
Host in Michelangelo s Last Judgment. Nevertheless, the tribunal 
failed to see the analogy, on the grounds that “in the Last 
Judgment it was not necessary to paint garments, and there is 
nothing in those figures that is not spiritual.” Like many of his 
contemporaries, Veronese claimed the privilege to “paint pictures 
as I see fit. ”

TINTORETTO Jacopo Robusti (1519-1594), called Tintoretto, 
took a less worldly attitude. He reportedly wanted “to paint like 
Titian and to design like Michelangelo.” He did not imitate the 
High Renaissance phases of those artists’ careers, however, but 
absorbed their later styles, which are more expressive and less 
realistic in their effects. In a number of large-scale paintings for 
Venetian confraternities, groups of laypeople organized for reli¬ 
gious activities, he assimilated the visionary effects of Titian’s late 
paintings and the energetic compositions of the late Michelangelo. 
Tintoretto’s final major work, The Last Supper , finished in 1594, 
is spectacular (fig. 17.39). It seems to deny in every possible way 
the balance and clarity of Leonardo’s version of the theme painted 
almost exactly a century before (see fig. 16.6), which nonetheless 
underlies Veronese’s picture. Jesus, to be sure, is at the center of 
the composition, but his small figure in the middle distance is dis¬ 
tinguished mainly by his brilliant halo. Tintoretto barely hints at 
the human drama of Judas’ betrayal, so important to Leonardo. 
Judas can be seen isolated on the near side of the table across from 
Jesus (as Castagno had arranged him in his fresco in Sant’Apollonia, 
see fig. 15.29), but his role is so insignificant that he could almost 
be mistaken for an attendant. The table is now placed at a sharp 
angle to the picture plane in exaggerated perspective. This 


arrangement had a purpose. Tintoretto designed it to relate the 
scene to the space of the chancel of San Giorgio Maggiore in 
Venice, designed by Palladio (see fig. 17.33), for which it was 
commissioned. When the Benedictine friars knelt at the altar rail 
to receive communion, they could see the scene at a less acute 
angle, as if the painted space continued their own. 

Tintoretto gives the event an everyday setting, cluttering 
the scene with attendants, containers of food and drink, and 
domestic animals. There are also celestial attendants who con¬ 
verge upon Jesus as he offers his body and blood, in the form 
of bread and wine, to the disciples. The smoke from the blazing 
oil lamp miraculously turns into clouds of angels, blurring the 
distinction between the natural and the supernatural and turning 
the scene into a magnificently orchestrated vision. The artist’s 
main concern is to make visible the miracle of the Eucharist—the 
Transubstantiation of earthly into divine food—in both real and 
symbolic terms. The central importance of this sacrament to 
Catholic doctrine was forcefully reasserted during the Catholic 
Counter-Reformation. The painting was especially appropriate 
for its location in San Giorgio Maggiore, which played a 
prominent role in the reform movement that would have broad 
repercussions for the arts in Europe in subsequent centuries.

Renaissance and Reformation 

in Sixteenth-Century 
Northern Europe 


00 


M any of the key events that occurred during the high 

Renaissance brought important changes throughout Europe, as well as 
in Italy In addition to the religious challenge of the Reformation 
fomented by Luther and the new cultural expressions of the Italian 
Renaissance, northern Europeans witnessed significant changes: the growing power 


of large centralized states in France, England, Spain, and the Holy 
Roman Empire; the expansion of Europe’s economic reach around 
the globe; and the rapid dissemination of new ideas and styles. As 
northern Europe experienced the birth pangs of the modern era, 
artists reconciled local traditions with these new conditions. 

The challenge of the Reformation to the Roman Catholic 
Church would fundamentally change the map of Europe (map 
18.1). Proponents of religious reform including Luther, Ulrich 
Zwingli, John Calvin, and others attracted many adherents, and 
whole communities, cities, and even states were converted, frac¬ 
turing the religious unity of Europe. Catholic Europe faced off 
against Protestant Europe, with great loss of life. While France and 
Spain remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, Germany, 
England, and the Netherlands were divided by religious sectarian¬ 
ism. The more radical reformed faiths deplored the Catholic 
tradition of religious images and relics, and encouraged the 
destruction of images in the areas that converted to their beliefs. 

Under such conditions, artists had to find new ways to pursue 
their craft and new markets for their products. Those markets 
would continue the trends established in the fifteenth century. A 
growing capitalist economy brought wealth and an increasing 
population to the cities. Manufacturing and trade grew, especially 

Detail of figure 18.23, Hans Holbein the Younger, Jean de Dinteville 
and Georges de Selve 


with the new Atlantic trade routes and colonial settlements in the 
Americas and Asia. Even as the cities developed in economic and 
social importance, increasingly authoritarian rulers asserted 
control over their domains. 

These pressures affected the character of the arts in northern 
Europe. In part because of the Protestant reformers’ suspicion of 
sculptural expression, the medium of painting increased in impor¬ 
tance in the sixteenth century. As religious patronage waned, 
artists turned to secular themes, which appealed to patrons in the 
cities and in the courts. To compete in the open market, artists 
began to specialize in particular subjects or themes. The achieve¬ 
ments of the Italian Renaissance also challenged northern artists, 
who absorbed Italian compositions, ideal figure types, and an 
admiration of antiquity. Patrons in the courts found Italian style 
particularly useful for expressing their power, as they built mon¬ 
umental palaces. Catholic rulers often used Italianate forms to 
affirm their faith. 

FRANCE: COURTLY TASTES 
FOR ITALIAN FORMS 

France was fertile ground for the importation of Italian ideas. 
French kings had been intervening in Italy for centuries, which 
brought them into contact with developments in Italian art and 
architecture. Charles VII of France had invaded Milan in 1499,

CHAPTER

and his successors continued to meddle in the Italian peninsula. 
Francis I (r. 1515-1547) showed his admiration for Italian art by 
inviting Leonardo da Vinci to work for him in the Loire Valley. 
Leonardo had provided designs for a never-constructed chateau 
for the king before dying in Amboise in 1519. Francis’s appre¬ 
ciation for Italian art and his propensity for spending money 
made his court a magnet for artists from Italy and elsewhere in 
Europe. Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, Benvenuto 
Cellini, and others found work there. French traditions were 
maintained, too, as local architects interpreted Italian ideas for 
royal structures. 

Chateaux and Palaces: 

Translating Italian Architecture 

During the Renaissance, French castles lost their fortified aspect 
and became palaces for enjoying country life. The influence of 
Italian architectural design came into play in the design of many 
of these structures, especially in the chateau that Francis I built 
south of Paris amid the forest of Fontainebleau (fig. 18.1). In 1528, 


he decided to expand the medieval hunting lodge that was once 
the haunt of King Louis IX. What began as a modest enlargement 
soon developed into a sprawling palace. The original design, 
much altered over the years, was largely the work of the stone¬ 
mason Gilles Le Breton (d. 1553), whose father, Jean (d. 1543/44), 
had helped design Chambord. Fontainebleau set a fashion for 
French translations of Italianate architecture that was followed 
for nearly all French chateaux for the next 250 years. 

The Cour du Cheval Blanc (Court of the White Horse) is typ¬ 
ical of the project as a whole. The design must have evolved in an 
organic fashion, with new generations of patrons and architects 
adding to it over time. (The Italianate staircase that now domi¬ 
nates the courtyard was built by Jean Androuet du Cerceau in 
1634.) Rectangular pavilions at regular intervals define the units of 
the facade. The facade employs a vocabulary from Italian archi¬ 
tecture: pilasters mark each story, entablatures tie the whole 
facade together horizontally, and the lowest level uses rusticated 
pilasters such as those used by Sansovino at the Mint in Venice 
(see fig. 17.31). These elements are blended with vertical propor¬ 
tions, especially in the windows and along the roofline. Such

vertical massing of forms reflects traditional castle design and the 
Gothic proportions that French patrons preferred to the more 
horizontal Italianate models. 

THE LOUVRE Despite a variety of wars and other entangle¬ 
ments, Francis I had a great appetite for commissioning 
large-scale projects. In 1546, he decided to replace the Gothic 
royal castle in Paris, the Louvre, with a new palace on the old site. 
The project had barely begun at the time of his death, but his 
architect, Pierre Lescot (ca. 1515-1578), continued and enlarged it 
under his successor, Henry II. This scheme was not completed for 
more than a century. Lescot built the southern half of the court s 
west side (fig. 18.2) in a more thoroughly Italianate style than was 
seen at Fontainebleau. 


The design represents a genuine synthesis of the traditional 
French chateau with the Italian palazzo. The superimposed clas¬ 
sical orders, the pedimented window frames, and the arcade on 
the ground floor stem from Italy Three projecting pavilions, 
however, have replaced the chateau turrets to interrupt the conti¬ 
nuity of the facade. The high-pitched roof is also French. The 
vertical accents, and the tall, narrow windows counteract and 
balance the horizontal elements. The whole effect is symmetrical 
and well organized; it is made sumptuous by the ornate carvings 
of the pilasters and their capitals and the relief sculpture that 
covers nearly all of the wall surface of the third story These 
reliefs, beautifully adapted to the architecture, are by Jean Goujon 
(ca. 1510-1565), a French sculptor of the mid-sixteenth century 
with whom Lescot often collaborated.

Art for Castle Interiors 

If the king showed a preference for Italian style, some members of 
the French court continued to commission works of art following 
the patterns established during the Middle Ages. Long after the 
invention of the printing press, French aristocrats continued to 
commission lavish books of hours and other illuminated books. 
French church architecture took the possibilities of the Gothic 
style to new heights (see fig. 12.44). Stained-glass windows 
remained an important medium for elite patrons, as did tapestry. 
The walls of their dwellings were lined with sets of these woven 
hangings, often depicting secular or allegorical themes. Tapestry 
weaving was an important industry in the Netherlands and in 
France. (See Materials and Techniques , page 629.) 

A famous survival of this art form is the set of the Unicorn 
Tapestries that depict the Hunt for the Unicorn, woven around 
1500 in the Southern Netherlands or northern France. The 
Unicorn in Captivity (fig. 18.3) is the culmination of a series of 
images describing the hunt for, death of, and resurrection of the 
unicorn, the mythical one-horned equine beast who could only be 
captured by a virgin. The theme depicts the courtly pastime of 
hunting, but the unicorn itself has been read as symbolizing 
Christ (details in the imagery suggest this) and as a secular bride¬ 
groom. This panel, which is just over 12 by 8 feet, shows the

628 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






















































































Making and Conserving Renaissance Tapestries 


T apestries—woven images hung on walls—were a major art form 
from the Middle Ages through the Baroque period. Elite patrons 
of Europe commissioned and purchased them to decorate the stone 
walls of their palaces and chateaux. In Flanders, the principal 
tapestry-making centers were in Arras, Tournai, and Brussels. In 
France, Louis XIV cemented the association of royalty with tapestry 
making by establishing the Royal Workshop of Gobelins in Paris, which 
dominated French tapestry production until the 
eighteenth century. 

The textiles were woven on looms, such as 
the one pictured in the Penelope tapestry in 
figure 1 4.1 9. Before the weaving could begin, 
the patron and the master of the workshop 
would choose a design, which was worked up 
into a cartoon, a full-scale drawing for the 
weaver to follow. 

To weave the textile, the weaver stretched 
supporting threads, called the warp, across the 
frame of a loom to the size desired. These warp 
threads are made of strong fibers, usually wool 
or linen. Colored threads of wool, silk, or spun 
metals are used to produce the design; these 
threads, called the weft, are then interwoven 
with the warp on the loom. 

Renaissance tapestries are designated “high warp” and “low warp” 
according to the arrangement of the loom: The high-warp technique 
stretches the warp threads vertically on the loom, while the low-warp 
technique stretches the threads horizontally. The figure of Penelope 
uses a small low-warp loom, as was common in Flanders. 



warp 


weft 


The weaver intertwines the horizontal 
threads (weft) with vertical threads (warp) 


Once the warp threads are stretched on the loom, the cartoon is 
placed below the loom. The weaver pushes the weft threads through 
the warp threads, alternating colors to create the design, and then 
tamps the weft threads into place to form a tight weave. Because 
the weaver works on the back side of the tapestry as he follows the 
cartoon, so that different colors may be joined and threads knotted, 
the front (or visible side) of the tapestry reproduces the cartoon design 
in reverse. 

Increasingly from the fifteenth century, the 
designs for tapestries came from painters, and 
as the pictorial ambitions of the painters grew, 
so did the techniques of the weavers to match 
them. The increasing illusionism in the cartoons 
inspired weavers to work with finer threads to 
make the tapestries more complex. Woven of 
wool, silk, and gilt threads, The Unicorn in 
Captivity (see fig. 1 8.3) displays tremendously 
detailed images of flowers, foliage, and animals. 
One scholar estimates that it took one hour per 
square inch to weave these dense designs; at 
this rate, a team of weavers would have been 
able to complete only one tapestry per year. 

Conservators worked on the Unicorn 
Tapestries recently, replacing their linen back¬ 
ings. This made it possible to see the back of the tapestry, revealing 
the incredibly rich colors with which it was woven, but which have 
faded with the passage of time on the front. The tapestries were then 
immersed in purified water to be cleaned, before being allowed to dry. 
A new backing was then sewn into place. 


unicorn fenced in below a pomegranate tree against a verdant 
background enlivened by numerous flowering plants. Specific 
elements such as the plants and flowers are wonderfully detailed 
and naturalistic, with the tapestry as a whole creating a sumptu¬ 
ous two-dimensional effect. The brilliant white body of the uni¬ 
corn itself is the focal point at the center of the field of flowers. 
Details like the pomegranates—a symbol of fertility and of eter¬ 
nity—combine with the numerous plants and animals to suggest 
the theme of Christian salvation, but may also refer to marriage 
and procreation. Some scholars have suggested that these tapes¬ 
tries were created to celebrate a marriage, perhaps of the individ¬ 
uals whose initials (A and a backward E) intertwine in the tree 
branches. Despite exhaustive research, their identification remains 
uncertain. Tapestries continued to be an important art form in 
France, given an important boost by the establishment of the 
royal factory of Gobelins in the seventeenth century. 

THE SCHOOL OF FONTAINEBLEAU Francis Fs preference 
for Italian art is apparent throughout the chateau at 
Fontainebleau. The king called upon Italian artists, most of them 


working in a Mannerist style, to work there, and these artists 
initiated the so-called School of Fontainebleau. To decorate the 
Gallery of Francis I, the king summoned Rosso Fiorentino from 
Italy (see page 593). Between 1531 and 1540, Rosso executed 
frescoes framed by stucco putti. The combination of painting 
and sculpted imagery inspired another Italian emigre, Francesco 
Primaticcio (1504-1570), who replaced Rosso as the chief 
designer at the royal chateau. The influence of Parmigianino is 
clear in Primaticcio’s most important surviving work, the 
decorations for the room of the king s mistress, the Duchesse 
d’Etampes (fig. 18.4). Primaticcio follows Rosso s general scheme 
of embedding paintings in a luxuriously sculptured stucco frame¬ 
work, which nearly swallows them. However, the figures are 
subtly elongated in the style of Parmigianino (see fig. 17.29). 
The four females in this detail have no specific allegorical signifi¬ 
cance, although their role recalls the nudes of the Sistine Chapel 
ceiling. These willowy figures (reminiscent of the caryatids in 
ancient Greek architecture) enframe paintings devoted to 
Alexander the Great that were executed by assistants from 
Primaticcio s designs.

The scene in figure 18.4 shows Apelles painting the abduction 
of Campaspe by Alexander the Great. According to the story, 
Alexander gave his favorite concubine to the artist when he fell in 
love with her. Roman texts of this subject characterized this gift 
as a mark of Alexander s great respect for his court artist. Such 
mixtures of violence and eroticism appealed greatly to the 
courtly audience for which Primaticcio worked. The picture 
draws a parallel between Alexander and Francis I, and between 
Campaspe and the duchess, the king s mistress, who had taken 
Primaticcio under her protection. The artist may have seen him¬ 
self in the role of Apelles. 

ROYAL TOMBS AT SAINT-DENIS The presence of so many 
Italian artists at Fontainebleau made the chateau a laboratory of 
Italian style, which many French artists absorbed. For example, 
Germain Pilon (ca. 1535-1590) created monumental sculpture 
that is informed not only by the elegance of the School of 
Fontainebleau, but also by elements taken from ancient sculpture, 
the Gothic tradition, and Michelangelo. His main works are tombs, 


such as the Tomb of Henry II and Catherine de’ Medici (fig. 18.5) 
commissioned by Catherine de’ Medici and executed for the 
French royal pantheon at Saint-Denis. Primaticcio designed the 
architectural framework, a free-standing chapel on a platform 
decorated with bronze and marble reliefs. Fie also designed the 
corner figures of virtues as elegant young women. Pilon executed 
the sculpture. On the top of the tomb are the bronze figures of the 
king and queen kneeling in prayer, while inside the chapel the 
couple reappear as marble gisants, or recumbent effigies of the 
deceased. Gisants expressed the transient nature of the flesh, 
usually by showing the body in an advanced stage of decay, some¬ 
times with vermin crawling through their open cavities. Pilon 
inverts this concept: Instead of portraying decaying flesh, his 
gisants are idealized nudes. While the likenesses of the royal couple 
kneeling atop the structure record their features in life, the gisants 
represent them as beautiful beings in death: The queen is in the 
pose of a classical Venus and the king is represented similarly to 
the dead Christ. They evoke neither horror nor pity Instead, they 
have the pathos of a beauty that continues even in death.

Henry II s death in 1559 left his young son—still a minor—to 
inherit the throne, so his widow, Catherine de’ Medici, acted as 
regent during a troubled period. Increasing conflicts between 
Catholic and Protestant groups, called Huguenots, erupted into 
massacres and warfare between 1562 and 1598, when a policy of 
official toleration was announced by Henry IV. 

SPAIN: GLOBAL POWER 
AND RELIGIOUS ORTHODOXY 

Several events came together in the early sixteenth century to 
increase the status and influence of Spain in Europe. In 1500, 
Charles V was born to the son of Maximilian of Habsburg and the 
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. With this parentage, he 
became heir to the thrones of Spain, Aragon, and the Burgundian 
territories, as well as the title of Holy Roman emperor. Charles 
also asserted a Spanish claim to rule the Kingdom of Naples in 


southern Italy. Spain was thus integrated more fully into 
European power struggles than it had been in previous centuries. 
At the same time, the colonization of the lands Columbus had 
claimed in the Americas brought massive wealth into Spanish 
hands. Charles V’s efforts to promote and rule his vast holdings so 
exhausted him that in 1556 he divided his territory in half and 
abdicated in favor of his son Philip and his brother Ferdinand. 
Ferdinand took control of the traditional Habsburg territories in 
Central Europe. Reigning as king of Spain, the Netherlands, and 
New Spain in the Americas from 1556 to 1598, Philip inherited 
the problems that had bedeviled his father. Having succeeded in 
preventing the Turkish advance into Europe in 1571, he turned his 
attention to the religious upheavals that the Reformation had 
brought to Christian Europe. Pious and ardent in his orthodoxy, 
he tried to quash the rebellion of the Calvinist Northern 
Netherlands, and unsuccessfully attempted to invade England in 
1588, when the Spanish Armada suffered a disastrous defeat in the 
English Channel.

1 8.6 Juan Bautista de Toledo and Juan de Herrera. Escorial. Begun 1563. Near Madrid 


The Escorial 

Philip also inherited a taste for collecting works of art from his 
forebears. He invited Sophonisba Anguissola to become one of 
his court artists; he commissioned works from Titian and other 
Italian artists; he not only hired Netherlandish artists to work for 
him, he sought out fifteenth-century Flemish works, especially 
paintings by Bosch. In this effort, he acquired The Garden of 
Earthly Delights (see fig. 14.22) and many other objects, which 
were brought to his new palace and monastery complex outside 
Madrid, called the Escorial. Built to commemorate Philip s vic¬ 
tory over the French in 1557, this massive complex (fig. 18.6) 
was begun in 1563 by Juan Bautista de Toledo (d. 1567), who 
had worked with Michelangelo in Rome. The symmetrical mass¬ 
ing of the buildings and the focus on the church of San Lorenzo 
at the center reflect Italian Renaissance models, but the scale and 
the simplicity of the facades were dictated by King Philip. In 
consultation with leading Italian architects, including Palladio 
and Vignola, Juan Bautista de Toledo s successor at the Escorial, 

Juan de Herrera, expanded the design and introduced classi¬ 
cizing details such as the temple fronts on the facades of the main 
portal and the Church of San Lorenzo (fig. 18.7). These, however,

El Greco and Religious Painting in Spain 

Philip s strong commitment to Catholic orthodoxy led him to 
support the work of many new orders and institutions that arose 
during the Catholic Reformation. The Spanish Inquisition, for 
example, fervently pursued the work of rooting out heresy. The 
Spanish-born Ignatius of Loyolas followers, the Jesuits, had a 
strong presence in Spain, as did the Carmelite order, whose most 
famous member was the nun and reformer Teresa of Avila. Both 
the Jesuits and the Carmelites encouraged meditation among the 
faithful. Loyola wrote a treatise, The Spiritual Exercises , to teach 
believers to meditate in steps so that they might achieve visions so 
real that they would seem to appear before their very eyes. The 


spiritual writings of Teresa of Avila, informed by her visions, urge 
prayer to achieve closer union with God (see fig. 19.31). 

In this atmosphere, the best-known painter of sixteenth- 
century Spain, Domenikos Theotokopoulos (1541-1614), called 
El Greco, found a home. Born on Crete, which was then under 
Venetian rule, he probably trained there to become an icon 
painter. At some point before 1568, he arrived in Venice and 
quickly absorbed the lessons of Titian and Tintoretto, but he also 
knew the art of Raphael, Michelangelo, and the Italian 
Mannerists. He went to Spain in 1576-77 and settled in Toledo for 
the rest of his life. El Greco joined the leading intellectual circles 
of the city, then a major center of learning, as well as the seat of 
Catholic reform in Spain. El Greco s painting exhibits an exalted 
emotionalism informed by his varied artistic sources. 

Among the most impressive of El Greco s commissions is The 
Burial ofCount Orgaz (fig. 18.8), executed in 1586 in the church

of Santo Tome in Toledo. The program, which was dictated in the 
commission, emphasizes the Roman Catholic position that good 
works are required to achieve salvation and that saints serve as 
intercessors with Heaven. This huge canvas honors a medieval 
benefactor so pious that St. Stephen and St. Augustine miracu¬ 
lously appeared at his funeral and lowered his body into its grave. 
Although the burial took place in 1323, El Greco presents it as a 
contemporary event; he even portrays many of the local nobility 
and clergy of his time among the attendants. The display of color 
and texture in the armor and vestments reflects El Grecos 
Venetian training. Above, the count s soul (a small, cloudlike fig¬ 
ure like the angels in Tintorettos Last Supper , see fig. 17.39) is 
carried to Heaven by an angel. The celestial assembly in the upper 
half of the picture is painted very differently from the group in the 
lower half: Every form—clouds, limbs, draperies—takes part in 
the sweeping, flamelike movement toward the figure of Christ. El 
Greco s compressed space, unearthly light, and weightless bodies 


share stylistic features with Italian Mannerist works such as 
Rossos The Descent from the Cross (see fig. 17.1). 

Only when the work is seen in its original setting (fig. 18.9) 
does its full meaning become clear. The painting fills one entire 
wall of its chapel, like a huge window. In the shallow space of the 
chapel a viewer must stand close and look sharply upward to see 
the upper half of the picture. The violent foreshortening is calcu¬ 
lated to achieve an illusion of boundless space in the upper 
portion of the painting, while the figures in the lower foreground 
appear as if on a stage. The large stone plaque set into the wall also 
belongs to the ensemble. It represents the front of the sarcopha¬ 
gus into which the two saints lower the body of the count, which 
explains the action in the picture. A viewer, then, perceives three 
levels of reality. The first is the grave itself, supposedly set into the 
wall at eye level and closed by an actual stone slab; the second is 
the reenactment of the miraculous burial; and the third is the 
vision of celestial glory witnessed by some of the participants. 
This step-by-step movement into the world of the picture may be 
linked to meditative practices of the era. Working in steps to 
achieve such a vision could only be achieved through the kind of 
strenuous devotion and commitment to mysticism encouraged by 
Loyola and Teresa of Avila. El Greco s work mirrors the intensity 
of such deep spiritual struggle. 

CENTRAL EUROPE: 

THE REFORMATION AND ART 

While Italy, France, and Spain adhered to the Catholic faith, else¬ 
where in Europe the religious and artistic situation became more 
volatile. In addition to Spain, Charles V had inherited the many 
different political units that comprised what is now Germany, 
Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Governing such 
disparate regions posed many challenges, which were passed 
along to Charles s brother Ferdinand when Charles stepped down 
as ruler in 1556. Though linked in many cases by language and 
cultural ties, as well as by trade, these were independent regions 
only nominally under control of the Holy Roman emperor. What 
unity they may have had suffered another blow after 1517, when 
religious unity was fractured by the Protestant Reformation. 

In October 1517, Martin Luther, a former Augustinian friar 
who had become professor of theology at the University of 
Wittenberg, issued a public challenge to both the theology and the 
institutional practices of the Catholic Church. In his famous 
Ninety-five Theses , which he posted on the church door at 
Wittenberg Castle, Luther complained about the Catholic prac¬ 
tice of selling indulgences—promises of redemption of sins; he 
argued, too, against the veneration of Mary and the saints. Most 
fundamental to his critique of Catholicism, Luther claimed that 
the Bible and natural reason were the sole bases of religious 
authority, and that the intervention of clerics and saints was 
unnecessary for salvation, which was freely given by God. It fol¬ 
lowed from this that religious authority was transferred from the 
pope to the individual conscience of each believer. The Catholic 


634 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 













Church responded by condemning Luther in 1521. But many 
Christians in Europe accepted his critique, which eventually 
fueled political instability, rebellions, and wars. Many areas of 
northern Germany converted to the reformed faith, while south¬ 
ern regions, such as Bavaria, remained Catholic. In rethinking 
these basic issues of faith, Luther was joined by other religious 
reformers (see map 18.1). 

Protestant thinkers following Luther aimed to eliminate the 
abuses they perceived in the Catholic Church. The Swiss pastor 
Ulrich Zwingli wanted to reduce religion to its essentials by 
stressing individual access to Scripture. As a result of his literal 
reading of the Bible, he denounced not only the sale of indul¬ 
gences, but the visual arts as well. Zwingli interpreted the 
Eucharist as a symbolic, rather than actual, communion of bread 
and wine; his theology led to a split with Luther that was never 
healed. What concerned the reformers above all were the twin 
issues of grace and free will in attaining faith and salvation. By the 
time of Zwingli s death at the hands of the Catholic forces in 1531, 
the main elements of Protestant theology had been defined. John 
Calvin of Geneva codified these tenets around midcentury; 
Calvins vision of a moral life based on a literal reading of 
Scripture was to prove very influential. The spread of the 
reformed faiths led to decades of violence, including a Peasants’ 
Revolt in 1525 and wars in regions that were converting to 
Protestantism. From 1546, German principalities fought with the 
emperor Charles V, until the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. By this 
compromise, the rulers of individual regions of Germany chose 
the faith for their own inhabitants. This furthered the spread 
of the reformed faiths, but also fostered the political divisions of 
the area. 

The repercussions for art were equally dramatic. Luther’s own 
attitudes toward the visual arts, expressed in his writings, veered 
between warning of the danger of idolatry and seeing the value of 
art as a tool for teaching. (See www.myartslab.com. ) Some of the 
more radical reformers saw the many forms of medieval and 
Renaissance religious art as nothing short of idolatry that needed 
to be cleansed. Inspired by reformers’ zeal, civic leaders, artisans, 
and workers attacked religious images in the cities. Several waves 
of image destruction, called iconoclasm, resulted in great losses of 
works of art from earlier periods. And as large areas of Central 
Europe converted to the new faiths, art forms that had been the 
bread and butter for artists disappeared, as churches were white¬ 
washed and religious commissions dried up. Artists in many 
mediums had to find new styles, new subjects, and new markets 
for their work. 

Humanism and the new technology of printing played a vital 
role in the Reformation. The humanist spirit of inquiry and 
respect for original texts inspired the writings of famous intellec¬ 
tuals and teachers, such as Desiderius Erasmus in Rotterdam, 
Philip Melancthon in Germany, and Thomas More in England. 
Published Latin texts spread new ideas all over Europe. As a 
result, the printing press became an important factor in both 
the development and the dispersion of Reformation thought. 
Individual access to Scripture was a fundamental tenet of the 


reformers, so they wanted to make available good texts of the 
Bible as well as translations of it into vernacular languages. Luther 
himself translated the Bible into German. Printed images 
contributed to the spread of Reformation ideas; inexpensive 
woodcuts satirized the Catholic hierarchy while making heroes 
of the reformers. Prints also illustrated the tenets of the 
new faiths. 

Catholic Contexts: The Isenheim Altarpiece 

Yet not all regions of German-speaking Europe converted to the 
reformed faiths, and it was not until the 1520s that the 
Reformation took wide hold. As such, some traditional objects 
were created in the sixteenth century to serve Catholic patrons. 
One such object is an altarpiece executed by the painter Matthias 
Gothart Nithart, who was known for centuries only as 
Griinewald (ca. 1475-1528). This nickname was given to him by a 
seventeenth-century author; when German artists in the modern 
period began searching for roots, they discovered the artist 
through his nickname and it has stuck. Griinewald was born in 
Wurzburg in central Germany and worked for the archbishop of 
nearby Mainz. His most famous work is a transforming triptych 
called the Isenheim Altarpiece , similar in structure to the St. 
Wolfgang Altarpiece by Pacher (see fig. 14.28). It was painted 
between 1509-10 and 1515 for the monastery church of the Order 
of St. Anthony at Isenheim, in Alsace, not far from the former 
abbey that now houses it in the city of Colmar. 

This church served the monks and the patients of the hospital 
attached to their monastery. The monks specialized in tending 
people who suffered from a disease called St. Anthony’s Fire, 
which was a disorder caused by eating spoiled rye. This disease 
produced painful symptoms, including intestinal disorders, 
gangrenous limbs, and hallucinations. Treatment consisted mostly 
of soothing baths and in some cases the amputation of limbs. 
Griinewald’s altarpiece stood on the high altar of the monastery 
church, where both the sick in the hospital and the monks who 
served them could see it. This extraordinary altarpiece encases a 
huge shrine carved in wood by Nicolas Hagenau around 1505. 
Enclosing the carved central section are nine panels organized in 
two sets of movable wings. These open in three stages or “views. ” 
The first of these views, when all the wings are closed, shows 
the Crucifixion in the center panel (fig. 18.10). This is the view 
that was visible during the week. The wings depict St. Sebastian 
(left), who was invoked against the plague (see fig. 15.48) and 
St. Anthony Abbot (right), who was revered as a healer. The cen¬ 
tral image of the Crucifixion draws on the late medieval tradition 
of the Andachtsbild (see fig. 12.60) to emphasize the suffering of 
Christ and the grief of his mother. The figure of Christ, with its 
twisted limbs, its many wounds, its streams of blood, matches the 
vision of the fourteenth-century mystic St. Bridget as described in 
her book of Revelations , which had been published in a German 
edition in 1501-02. 

Griinewald renders the body on the Cross on a heroic scale, so 
that it dominates the other figures and the landscape. The

Crucifixion, lifted from its familiar setting, becomes a lonely 
event silhouetted against a ghostly landscape and a blue-black sky. 
Despite the darkness of the landscape, an eerie light bathes the 
foreground figures to heighten awareness of them. On the left, 
Mary s white garment enfolds her as she swoons at the sight of her 
tortured son; the red of St. Johns robe accents her paleness. 
Below the Cross, Mary Magdalen, identified by her ointment jar, 
kneels in grief to lament. On the right, John the Baptist points to 
the Crucified Christ with the words, “He must increase, and I 
must decrease,” indicating the significance of Christs sacrifice. 
Behind him a body of water recalls the healing power of baptism. 
The lamb at John s feet bleeds into a chalice, as does the lamb in 
the central panel of the Ghent Altarpiece (see fig. 14.10). The 
bleeding lamb is a reminder of the sacrament of the Eucharist, 
celebrated before the altarpiece. In the predella below, a tomb 
awaits the tormented body while his mother and friends bid 
him farewell. The predella slides apart at Christ s knees: Victims 
of amputation may have seen their own suffering reflected in 
this image. 

On Sundays and feast days the outer wings were opened and 
the mood of the Isenheim Altarpiece changed dramatically (fig. 

18.11) . All three scenes in this second view— The Annunciation , 
the Madonna and Child with Angels , and The Resurrection (fig. 

18.12) —celebrate events that are as jubilant as the Crucifixion is 
somber. Depicting the cycle of salvation, from the Incarnation to 
the Resurrection, this view of the altarpiece offered the afflicted a 
form of spiritual medicine while reminding them of the promise 
of Heaven. Throughout these panels, Griinewald depicts forms of 
therapy recommended for sufferers at the hospital: music, herbs, 
baths, and light. The contrast of the body of the dead Jesus in the 
predella with the Resurrected Christ in the right panel offers 
consolation to the dying. 

Griinewald links the panels through color and composition. 
Reds and pinks in The Annunciation panel on the left are carried 
through the central panels to reach a climax with the brilliant col¬ 
ors surrounding the risen figure of Christ on the right. The figure 
of the dead Jesus held by his mother and friends in the predella 
adds poignancy to the figure of the child Jesus in his mother s 
arms in the central panel. The simple Gothic chapel in which the 
Annunciation takes place gives way in the next panel to a fanciful 
tabernacle housing choirs of angels who play stringed instruments 
and sing. Beneath that tabernacle appears a figure of the Virgin, 
crowned and glowing like a lit candle. The aureole surrounding 
this figure anticipates the brilliant figure of the Resurrected Christ 
in the right-hand panel, whose body seems to dissolve into 
light. The central image of the Madonna holding her child in a 
tender embrace gives way to a vision of Heaven, also made of 
pure light. 

These elements lead the eye to the right panel, where the body 
of Christ appears to float above his stone sarcophagus. The guards 
set to watch the tomb are knocked senseless by the miracle. Their 
figures, carefully arranged in a perspectival display, contrast to the 
weightless and transfigured body of Christ. As he holds his hands 
up, the shroud falls to reveal the wounds he suffered in death,

now as brilliant as the halo that engulfs his body. This figure 
differs dramatically from the figure on the Cross; his body bears 
no scars and the proportions are closer to the Italian ideal seen in 
Piero della Francesca s Resurrection (see fig. 15.43). 

Griinewald s strikingly individual approach to form is based 
on the traditions of the northern European Renaissance estab¬ 
lished in the fifteenth century. His oil technique, his brilliant use 
of color, and the detailed rendering of objects draw from that 
tradition, but he must have learned from the Italian Renaissance 
too. The low horizon lines suggest a deep space for his figures and 
the rendering of the tomb from which Christ rises is a study in 
perspective. Yet Griinewald does not try to convince the viewer 
of the weight and substance of his figures; his aim is to create an 
emotional response with the impact of a vision. 


CHAPTER 1 8 RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION IN SI XTEEN TH-CEN TU R Y NORTHERN EUROPE 637 








Albrecht Diirer and the Northern Renaissance 


The crucial figure for the Renaissance in Germany is Griinewald s 
contemporary Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528). Diirer s style was 
formed in the tradition of northern European naturalism (which 
we explored in Chapter 14), but he delved deeply into the inno¬ 
vations and possibilities of Italian art. After training as a painter 
and printmaker in his native Nuremberg, Diirer traveled in north¬ 
ern Europe and Venice in 1494-95 before returning home to start 
his career. His travels not only expanded his visual repertoire, but 
changed his view of the world and the artist s place in it. (He 
returned to Italy in 1505.) Diirer adopted the ideal of the artist as 
a gentleman and humanistic scholar, and took the Italian view that 
the fine arts belonged among the liberal arts, as artists like 
Mantegna and Alberti had argued (see Chapter 15). By cultivating 
his artistic and intellectual interests, Diirer incorporated into his 
work an unprecedented variety of subjects and techniques. His 
painting technique owes much to the Flemish masters, but mak¬ 
ing copies of Italian works taught him many of the lessons of the 
Italian Renaissance. He was able to synthesize these traditions in 
his paintings and prints. As the greatest printmaker of the time, he 
had a wide influence on sixteenth-century art through his wood- 
cuts and engravings, which circulated all over Europe. His prints 
made him famous and wealthy—so much so that he complained 
about the relatively poor reward he earned for his paintings. 

Diirer s debt to the legacy of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der 
Weyden is clear in the many drawings and watercolors he made in

preparation for his works. The watercolor of a hare he made in 
1502 (fig. 18.13) demonstrates the clarity of his vision and the 
sureness of his rendering. Diirer treated this small representative 
of the natural world with the dignity due to nature herself, much 
as Van Eyck had painted the small dog in the foreground of The 
“Arnolfini Portrait ” (see fig. 14.14). Diirer uses the watercolor 
technique to render each hair of the fur, the curve of the ears, the 
sheen on the eyes. His monogram at the base of the page identi¬ 
fies Diirer as the creator of this image; this monogram was the 
signature he used on his mature prints. 

Diirer s ability as a draftsman also informed his work as a 
printmaker. Having been trained in both woodcut and engraving, 
he pushed the limits of both mediums. As a mass medium, prints 
were not commissioned by individual patrons, but were made for 
the open market, so Diirer had to invest his own materials and 
unpaid time in these projects. This entrepreneurial spirit served 
him well, as his prints sold widely and quickly, in part because of 


638 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 
















































his astute choice of subject matter. Signs and portents, such as the 
threat of invasion by the Turks and the birth of malformed ani¬ 
mals, worried Europeans as they awaited the approach of the year 
1500. As this year drew near, many people believed that the 
Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and prepared for the 
Millennium. Thus, with an eye to the market for things pertaining 
to popular fears about the end of time, Diirer produced a wood- 
cut series illustrating the Apocalypse in 1498. This series was his 
most ambitious graphic work in the years following his return 
from Italy. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (fig. 18.14) offers 
the viewer a frightening visualization of the text of the book of 
Revelation. The image depicts War, Conquest, Famine, and Death 
overrunning the earth. During his trip to Italy in 1494, Diirer had 
encountered prints by Mantegna, which he carefully copied. He 
especially admired the sculptural quality Mantegna achieved in 
paintings such as the St. Sebastian (see fig. 15.48). The physical 
energy and full-bodied volume of the figures in the Apocalypse 
series is partly owed to Diirer s experience of Italian art, although 
he eliminates logical space in favor of an otherworldly flatness. 
Diirer has redefined his medium—the woodcut—by enriching it 
with the linear devices of engraving. Instead of the broad contours 



and occasional hatchings used to define form in earlier woodcuts, 
Diirer s wide range of hatching marks, varied width of lines, and 
strong contrasts of black and white produce ambitious pictorial 
effects. (Compare, for example, the Buxheim St. Christopher of 
1423 shown in fig. 14.29). He set a standard that soon transformed 
the technique of woodcuts all over Europe. 

Diirer s fusion of northern European and Italian traditions is 
apparent in his engraving entitled Adam and Eve of 1504 (fig. 
18.15), for which the watercolor Hare was a preliminary study. 
Here the biblical subject allows him to depict the first parents as 
two ideal nudes: Apollo and Venus stand in a densely wooded 
forest. Unlike the picturesque setting and the animals in it, Adam 
and Eve are not observed from life; they are constructed accord¬ 
ing to what Diirer believed to be the perfect proportions based on 
Vitruvius. (See www.myartslab.com. ) Once again, Diirer enlarged 
the vocabulary of descriptive marks an engraver could use: The 
lines taper and swell; they intersect at varying angles; marks start 
and stop and dissolve into dots, called stipples. The result is a 
monochrome image with a great tonal and textural range. The 
animals that populate the Garden of Eden are very deliberately 
chosen: Scholars have interpreted the cat, rabbit, ox, and elk as 
symbols of the medieval theory that bodily fluids, called humors, 
controlled personality. The cat represents the choleric humor, 
quick to anger; the ox the phlegmatic humor, lethargic and slow; 
the elk stands for the melancholic humor, sad and serious; and the 
rabbit for the sanguine, energetic and sensual. In this moment 
before the Fall, the humors coexist in balance and the humans 
retain an ideal beauty. The composition itself is balanced and 
unified by the tonal effects. Diirer s print, which he signed promi¬ 
nently on the plaque by Adam s head, was enormously influential. 
His ideal male and female figures became models in their own 
right for countless other artists. 

IMAGES ABOUT ARTISTRY Although best known for his 
prints, Diirer was also a gifted draftsman and skilled painter. One 
of his earliest works, a drawing made at 13, is a self-portrait that 
foreshadowed his fascination with his own image throughout his 
career. Most impressive, and very revealing, is the painted Self- 
Portrait of 1500 (fig. 18.16). In pictorial terms, it belongs to the 
Flemish tradition of Jan van Eyck s Man in a Red Turban (see fig. 
14.13), but the solemn pose and the idealization of the features 
have an authority not found in most portraits up to this time. 
Instead of a conventional three-quarter pose, Diirer places himself 
frontally in the composition, a pose usually reserved for images of 
the divine. The panel looks, in fact, like a secularized icon, for it 
is patterned after images of Christ. It reflects both Diirer s deep 
piety and the seriousness with which he viewed his mission as an 
artist and intellectual.

Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528) 

From the journal of his trip to the Netherlands, 
1521 

Diirer traveled to Aachen and the Netherlands in 1521 to witness the 
investiture of the new emperor , Charles V. He kept a diary during this 
journey>, which o ffers many insights into his finances, friends, and intel¬ 
lectual interests. While in Antwerp he heard a false rumor that Martin 
Luther had been taken prisoner. In response to this news, Diirer wrote 
the following lament which reveals his thinking about religious issues of 
the moment. 

O n Friday before Whitsunday in the year 1521 [May 17, 1521] 
the news came to me in Antwerp that Martin Luther had been 
so treacherously taken prisoner; ... there came 10 horsemen and they 
treacherously carried off the pious man, betrayed into their hands, a 
man enlightened by the Holy Ghost, a follower of Christ and the true 
Christian faith. And whether he is still alive, or whether they have 
murdered him, which I know not, he has suffered this for the sake of 
Christian truth and because he rebuked the unchristian Papacy. ... 


Ach, God of Heaven, pity us! O Lord Jesus Christ, pray for Thy 
people! ... 

And if we have lost this man, who has written more clearly than 
any that has lived for 140 years, and to whom Thou has given such a 
spirit of the Gospel, we pray Thee, O Heavenly Father, that Thou 
wouldst again give Thy Holy Spirit to another, that he may gather 
Thy church anew everywhere together, that we may again live united 
and in Christian manner, and so, by our good works, all unbelievers 
as Turks, Heathen and Calicuts, may of themselves turn to us and 
embrace the Christian faith. ... 

May every man who reads Dr. Martin Luther s books see how clear 
and transparent his teaching is when he sets forth the Holy Gospel. 
Wherefore his books are to be held in great honor and not to be 
burned. ... Ach, God, what might he not still have written for us in 
ten or twenty years? O all ye Christian men, help me to weep with¬ 
out ceasing for this man, inspired of God, and to pray him to send us 
another such enlightened man. O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where will 
you stand? ... O Erasmus, take your stand here, so that God himself 
may be your praise.

University Press, 1 990) 




The status of the artist may also be the theme of one of Diirer s 
most famous and puzzling prints. This is an engraving labeled 
Melencolia I (fig. 18.17), one of a trio of prints that Diirer sold or 
gave away together. Dated 1514, the image represents a winged 
female holding a compass, surrounded by the tools of the mathe¬ 
matician and the artist. She holds the tools of geometry, yet is 
surrounded by chaos. The figure is probably a personification, 
though her identity is controversial: She has been identified as 
Melancholy, as Geometry, and as Genius. Her face in shadow, 
she sits in a pose long associated with melancholy, which contem¬ 
poraries connected with intellectual activity and creative genius. 
Compare her pose to Raphaels depiction of Michelangelo as 
Heraclitus in The School of Athens (see fig. 16.24). Like Raphael, 
Diirer shrouds the figures face in shadow, as though she is 
lost in thought. Diirer s figure thinks but cannot act, while the 
infant scrawling on the slate, symbolizing practical knowledge, 
can act but not think. Diirer appears to be making a statement 
here about the artistic temperament and its relationship to the 
melancholic humor. 

Renaissance philosophers, like the Italian humanist Marsilio 
Ficino, viewed melancholia as the source of divine inspiration. 
The notion of the melancholic genius was widespread in 
Diirer s time. This print seems to claim for the visual artist (and 
perhaps for Diirer himself?) the status of divinely inspired, if 
melancholic, genius.

A REFORMATION ARTIST Diirer became an early and 
enthusiastic follower of Martin Luther, although, like Griinewald, 
he continued to work for Catholic patrons. His new faith can be 
sensed in the growing austerity of style and subject in his religious 
works after 1520, as well as in his admiration of Martin Luther, 
expressed in the journal he kept on a journey to the Netherlands 


in 1521. (See Primary Source , page 641.) The climax of this trend 
is represented by The Four Apostles (fig. 18.18). These paired 
panels have rightly been termed Diirer s artistic testament. He 
presented them in 1526 to the city of Nuremberg, which had 
joined the Lutheran camp the year before. These four men are 
fundamental to Protestant doctrine. John and Paul, Luthers

favorite authors of Scripture, face one another in the foreground, 
with Peter and Mark behind. Quotations from their writings, 
inscribed below in Luthers translation, warn the city not to 
mistake human error and pretense for the will of God. They 
plead against Catholics and Protestant radicals alike. But in 
another, more universal sense, the figures represent the Four 
Temperaments and, by implication, the other cosmic quartets— 
the seasons, the elements, the times of day, and the ages of life. 
The apostles have a sculptural solidity that brings to mind Nanni 
di Banco s Quattro Coronati (see fig. 15.10). The heavily draped 
figures have the weight and presence of Raphael s figures in the 
tapestry cartoon St. Paul Preaching at Athens (see fig. 16.26), 
which Diirer probably saw on his trip to the Netherlands in 1521. 
Through the power of his paintings, the portable medium of 
prints, and his workshop, Diirer was the most influential artist of 
sixteenth-century Germany 

Religious and Courtly Images 
in the Era of Reform 

The realignment of German culture and society produced by the 
Reformation required artists to adapt their styles and subject mat¬ 
ter for the reformed faiths. The mass medium of prints was an 


important tool for spreading the tenets of the Protestant confes¬ 
sions. For courtly patrons, artists made images on classicizing 
themes, for which they used local visual traditions that empha¬ 
sized detail, texture, and the natural world. 

In Reformation Germany, painters had to contend with the 
Protestant leaders’ ambivalence toward religious images. When a 
faith places the Word above the Image, image becomes subordi¬ 
nate to text; though Luther himself tolerated images (see 
www.myartslab.com ), the works that most deliberately address 
Lutheran themes are often literal illustrations of texts. 

LUCAS CRANACH! REFORMER AND COURT ARTIST 

Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472-1553), a close friend of Martin 
Luther, attempted to solve the problem of casting Luther s doc¬ 
trines into visual form. Cranach made numerous prints and paint¬ 
ings to express the tenets of the reformer. A woodcut of around 
1530 entitled An Allegory of Law and Grace (fig. 18.19) contrasts 
the difference between the fate of a Catholic and a Lutheran. The 
left side depicts the Catholic doctrine that the children of Adam 
and Eve, stained by Original Sin, must perform specific deeds 
according to the Law of Moses; yet when this is unsuccessful, the 
soul is consigned to Hell at the Last Judgment. The right side 
depicts Luther s position: the believer is washed in the blood of 


CHAPTER 1 8 RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION IN SI XTEEN TH-CEN TU R Y NORTHERN EUROPE 643 



















Christ’s Crucifixion, because faith in Christ alone assures salva¬ 
tion. Compared to Diirer’s woodcuts, this image is rather simple 
and straightforward, without complex tonalities, illusions of 
space, or an emphasis on textures. Cranach makes the image as 
legible and accessible as the text, subordinating artistic effects 
to clarity. 

In addition to images with Lutheran content, Cranach 
excelled in portraits and mythological scenes painted for aristo¬ 
cratic patrons, both Catholic and Protestant, in Saxony and 
elsewhere in Germany. In The Judgment of Paris (fig. 18.20) of 
about 1528, Cranach retells a story from Greek mythology in 
which the Trojan prince Paris selects the most beautiful goddess 
of Olympus. He depicts Paris as a German knight clad in the fash¬ 
ionable armor of the nobles at the court of Saxony. The sinewy 
figures of the goddesses are displayed for the judgment of the 
prince, who confides his choice to Mercury, also dressed in armor.

Like many of his Italian contemporaries working for aristocratic 
patrons, Cranach gives his classical subject an overtly erotic 
appeal, inviting a viewer to identify with Paris as the privileged 
observer of the female nudes. Yet the detailed, miniaturistic 
technique and the weightless bodies of the women are distinctive 
to Cranach. One of the most striking features here is the land¬ 
scape, whose lush vegetation recalls Diirer s Adam and Eve (see 
fig. 18.15); through the thick hedge of trees in the foreground a 
viewer sees a distant view, featuring a body of water and a city, 
perhaps Troy. 

ALTDORFER’S BATTLE OF ISSOS Both Cranach and 
Diirer played a critical role in the development of the Danube 
School of landscape painting, which appeared in southern 
Germany and Austria in the first half of the sixteenth century. 
The key figure in this school, however, was Albrecht Altdorfer 
(ca. 1480-1538), a slightly younger artist who spent most of his 
career in Bavaria. Altdorfer made prints and paintings on a vari¬ 
ety of themes, though his primary subject is landscape, which he 
uses to great expressive effect. His most famous work is The 
Battle ofIssos (fig. 18.21). The painting, made in 1529, is one of a 
series of images depicting the exploits of historic heroes, commis¬ 
sioned for the Munich palace of William IV, duke of Bavaria. In a 
sweeping landscape, Altdorfer depicts Alexander the Great’s vic¬ 
tory over Darius of Persia, which took place in 333 BCE at Issos. 
This victory was the subject of a composition attributed to the 
Greek painter Apelles, preserved in a mosaic at Pompeii (see fig. 
5.78). To make the subject clear, Altdorfer provided an explana¬ 
tory text on the tablet suspended in the sky, inscriptions on the 
banners (probably written by the Regensburg court humanist 
Aventinus), and a label on Darius’ fleeing chariot. The artist has 
tried to follow ancient descriptions of the actual number and kind 
of combatants in the battle and to record the geography of the 
Mediterranean accurately. 

Altdorfer adopts an omniscient point of view, as if looking 
down on the action from a great height, to fit everything into the 
picture. From this planetary perspective, a viewer must search to 
find the two leaders lost in the antlike mass of their own armies. 
The drama of nature is more carefully elaborated than that of the 
human actors: One can almost feel the rotation of the globe as the 
sun sets in the distance and the moon rises. The curve of the earth, 
the drama of the clouds, the craggy mountain peaks overwhelm 
the mass of humanity. Such details suggest that the events por¬ 
trayed have an earth-shaking importance, which was arguably the 
case with this historical event. However, the soldiers’ armor and 
the fortified town in the distance are unmistakably of the six¬ 
teenth century, which encourages us to look for contemporary 
significance. The work was executed at the moment the Ottoman 
Turks were trying to invade Vienna after gaining control over 
much of eastern Europe. (Though the imperial forces repelled the 
Turks this time, they were to threaten Europe repeatedly for 
another 250 years.) Altdorfer’s image suggests that the contempo¬ 
rary battle between Europeans and Turks has the same global 
significance as Alexander’s battle with Darius.

Painting in the Cities: Humanist Themes 
and Religious Turmoil 

Cities along the Rhine River, especially Strasbourg and Basel, 
were centers of commerce, publishing, and humanism. The 
ancient city of Strasbourg’s commercial success was due to its 
location and its industry Further down the Rhine, Basel had a 
university as well as an early printing press. It was in Basel that 
Sebastian Brants Ship of Fools was published in 1494 (see fig. 
14.32). As elsewhere, the spread of Reformation and humanist 
ideas to these cities profoundly affected the arts, as seen especially 
in the work of Hans Baldung Grien and Hans Holbein. 

THE DARK SIDE OF HUMANISM! HANS BALDUNG 
GRIEN’S BEWITCHED GROOM The impact of humanism on 
German artists may be seen in the work of the painter and print- 
maker Hans Baldung Grien (1484/85-1545). This former apprentice

of Diirer spent much of his career in Strasbourg. Although he 
made some religious works, Baldung Grien made numerous 
secular images that explore themes of witchcraft, magic, and 
death. A characteristic example is his woodcut usually called The 
Bewitched Groom (fig. 18.22) and dated 1544. The print depicts a 
man lying on the floor of a stable, a grooming tool near his hand, 
while a woman waving a torch leans into the space. Having spent 
time in Durer s workshop, Baldung has mastered the woodcut 
technique and the lessons of Italian art. He uses a variety of marks 
to define form and to suggest textures, but he also organizes the 
space using perspective and foreshortening of both man and beast. 
He puts these skills to use in an image of the occult; most schol¬ 
ars see the woman with the torch as a witch, who has either 
stunned the man or controlled the horse to do it for her. The 
pitchfork beneath the groom may be her goal, as witches were 
reputed to use such tools to ride across the sky. Her fearsome 
image reflects a fear of witchcraft that took hold in Europe in the 
turbulent sixteenth century, even in humanist circles. 

HANS HOLBEIN, FROM BASEL TO LONDON The son of 

a painter, Hans Holbein the Younger (1497-1543) was born and 
raised in Augsburg, but he initially sought to make his career in 
Basel. By 1520, Holbein was established there as a painter and a 
designer of woodcuts. He had also become a member of the 
humanist circle that included the writer Desiderius Erasmus 
(1466-1536). Yet the spread of the Reformation disrupted human¬ 
ist activities in Basel. By 1525, followers of Zwingli preached the 
sole authority of Scripture, while more radical reformers preached 
that images were idols. To escape this climate, Holbein sought 
employment elsewhere. He had traveled to France in 1523-24, 
perhaps intending to offer his services to Francis I. Hoping for 
commissions at the court of Henry VIII, Holbein went to 
England in 1527, in possession of a letter from Erasmus recom¬ 
mending him to the humanist and royal advisor, Thomas More. In 
that letter, Erasmus wrote: “Here [in Basel] the arts are out in the 
cold.” By 1528, when Holbein returned to Basel, violence had 
replaced rhetoric. He witnessed Protestant mobs destroying reli¬ 
gious images, a scene Erasmus described in a letter: “Not a statue 
has been left in the churches or in the monasteries; all the frescoes 
have been whitewashed over. Everything which would burn has 
been set on fire, everything else hacked into little pieces. Neither 
value nor artistry prevailed to save anything.” Holbein resolved 
to return to London, which he did in 1532. 

Back in England, Holbein found his first patrons among mer¬ 
chants and diplomats, who were often also humanists. One of his 
largest works (fig. 18.23) depicts two ambassadors from France, 
Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve. Painted in 1533, when the 
English court was in turmoil because of the king s impending break 
with Rome, the image reflects Holbein s artistic origins and his 
gifts as a portraitist. The two men were friends, and Holbein rep¬ 
resents them in full length standing in a draped room with a tall 
double-tiered table between them. Jean de Dinteville, on the left, 
wears an elaborate fur-lined tunic over his velvet garment, as well 
as a chain identifying him as a member of the Order of St. Michael,

a French chivalric order. Opposite him stands Bishop Georges de 
Selve, in his cleric s collar, and covered in a warm gown. He bears 
no weapon or baton of office, as his friend does, but rests his arm 
on the Bible placed on the upper tier of the table. Holbein distin¬ 
guishes each man’s features and social station in the portrait. His 
rendering of textures, surfaces, and details harks back to Jan van 
Eyck, as in fact the standing double portrait does (see fig. 14.14). 

Nonetheless, the setting is as important as the two figures 
here. On the table between them, Holbein places a series of 
objects reflecting the interests of the two men. The bishop was a 
great patron of music, an enthusiasm alluded to in the presence of 
a lute (see page 624). The objects seem to have been chosen with 
care to add to the meaning of the image. Below the lute is an open 
book featuring hymns written by Martin Luther. The lute itself 
has a broken string—it is an emblem of discord. Instruments that 
measure time (a sundial) or that track the constellations sit on the 
upper tier. Two globes—a celestial globe above and a terrestrial 
one below—appear closer to de Dinteville. (His own town is 


marked on the terrestrial globe.) These objects contrast the 
study of earthly and heavenly subjects, with the implication that 
discord and division rule the earthly sphere. Before all looms an 
anamorphic representation of a skull: It is set into a dramatically 
exaggerated perspective so that its form is only clearly readable 
from an acute angle. The skull serves as a vanitas, a reminder that 
the things of this world are fleeting. Holbein s success in record¬ 
ing the interests and concerns of these two men likely brought 
him to the notice of the rest of the court. 

ENGLAND: 

REFORMATION AND POWER 

Holbein s principal patron in England was the ambitious Henry 
VIII, who reigned from 1509 to 1547. Henry wanted England to 
be a powerbroker in the conflicts between Francis I of France 
and the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, although his personal

situation complicated these efforts. Married to Catherine of 
Aragon in 1509, 20 years later Henry was seeking to annul their 
union, for they had failed to produce a male heir to the throne. 
Thwarted in his desire by the Catholic Church, he established 
himself as the head of the breakaway Church of England in 1534. 
His desire for a male heir led Henry into a number of marriages, 
most of which ended either in divorce or in the execution of his 
wife. He had three children, who succeeded him as Edward VI, 
Mary I, and Elizabeth I. 

Holbein had come to the notice of the king by 1536, and by 
1537 was serving as the kings painter, his primary assignment 
being to make portraits of the king and his court. His Henry VIII 
(fig. 18.24) of 1540 captures the supreme self-confidence of the 
king. He uses the rigid frontality that Diirer had chosen for his 
self-portrait to convey the almost divine authority of this absolute 
ruler. The king’s physical bulk creates an overpowering sense of 
his ruthless, commanding personality. The portrait shares with 
Bronzino’s Eleanora of Toledo (see fig. 17.10) its immobile pose, 
air of unapproachability, and precisely rendered costume and 
jewels. Holbein fashioned for Henry VIII a memorable public 
image of strength and power. Holbein’s portraits of the king 
and his courtiers molded British taste in aristocratic portraiture 
for decades. 


Henry’s daughter Elizabeth came to the throne in 1558 at the 
age of 25, and through her shrewdness and luck ruled until 1603. 
She managed to unite a country that had been bitterly divided by 
religious differences, and increased the wealth and status of 
England through her diplomacy, her perspicacious choice of advi¬ 
sors and admirals, and her daring. Her most important victory 
was the defeat of the Spanish Armada, sent to invade England in 
1588; but the Elizabethan age is also rightly famous for its music 
and literary arts. 

The influence of Elizabethan poetry may be seen in a minia¬ 
ture portrait by the English painter Nicholas Hilliard 
(1547-1619), usually called A Young Man Among Roses (fig. 
18.25). Inspired by ancient cameos (small medallions in relief), 
these portable portraits on parchment were tiny keepsakes often 
worn as jewelry Hilliard’s style reveals the influence of Holbein 
in the even lighting and careful detail. However, the tall, slender 
proportions, elegant costume, and languorous grace may reflect 
the impact of Italian Mannerism, probably by way of 
Fontainebleau; compare the courtier’s stance to that of 
Primaticcio’s stucco figures from the French palace (see fig. 18.4). 
In tremendous detail on a very small scale (this miniature is just 
over 5 inches high), Hilliard records the costume and features of 
the young man and the tree and flowers that surround him. An 
inscription suggests that he is suffering for his love. Other 
details—the black and white costume, the type of rose—imply 
that Elizabeth herself is his beloved, inspiring speculation about 
the man’s identity. The image may represent Robert Devereaux,

Elizabethan Imagery 

The poets and playwrights of Elizabethan England produced some of 
the most memorable literature in the English language. The sonnet , 
given authority as a poetic form by Petrarch , was used by both Edmund 
Spenser and William Shakespeare for their own love poetry. Spenser (ca. 
1552-1599) is best known for his epic poem The Faerie Queen, an alle¬ 
gory in part about Elizabeth I. Though best known for his plays , 
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) wrote many sonnets whose imagery 
is as vivid as that in the paintings of Nicholas Hilliard. 

Edmund Spenser, Sonnet Sixty-four, from the Amoretti (1595) 

Coming to kiss her lips, such grace I found 
Me seemed I smelt a garden of sweet flowers 
That dainty odours from them threw around 
For damzels fit to deck their lovers’ bowers: 

Her lips did smell like unto gillyflowers; 

Her ruddy cheeks like unto roses red; 

Her snowy brows like budded bellamours 
Her lovely eyes like pinks but newly spread; 

Her goodly bosom like a strawberry bed; 


Her neck like to a bunch of columbines; 

Her breast like lilies, ere their leaves be shed; 

Her nipples like young blossomed jessamines: 

Such fragrant flowers do give most odorous smell, 

But her sweet odour did them all excel. 

William Shakespeare, Sonnet Eighteen , from The Sonnets (published 
in 1609, though often dated to the 1590s) 

Shall I compare thee to a summers day? 

Thou art more lovely and more temperate: 

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 

And summers lease hath all too short a date: 

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 

And often is his gold complexion dimmed; 

And every fair from fair sometime declines, 

By chance, or nature s changing course, untrimmed: 

But thy eternal summer shall not fade, 

Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst; 

Nor shall Death brag thou wand’rest in his shade, 

When in eternal lines to time thou grow st. 

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, 

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. 




earl of Essex, Elizabeth s one-time favorite. The floral imagery 
and the lovesick poet are frequent motifs in Elizabethan sonnets, 
such as those of Edmund Spenser or William Shakespeare. Many 
images from the Elizabethan era carry texts or symbols that have 
parallels in Elizabethan court rituals and literature. (See Primary 
Source , above.) 

Like her father, Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth had a gift for 
managing her image. She had no Holbein in her employ to dom¬ 
inate the artistic life of her court, but she still managed to dictate 
to the many artists around her how she should be represented. 
She even imprisoned people for making unsanctioned images of 
her. A portrait by the Flemish artist Marcus Gheeraerts the 
Younger (fig. 18.26) exemplifies her carefully controlled iconog¬ 
raphy. The portrait represents Elizabeth standing on a map of her 
realm, which she dominates by her size and frontality. Sir Henry 
Lee, one of Elizabeth s courtiers, probably commissioned this 
portrait, often called The Ditcheley Portrait ; Ditcheley was his 
estate near Oxford. Elizabeth wears one of the elaborate dresses 
that she favored, significantly in white, the color of virginity; 
Elizabeth steadfastly refused to marry, claiming that she was mar¬ 
ried to England. One side of the background is dark and gloomy: 
A storm has just passed and the sun shines again. A fragmentary 
sonnet expresses thanks for a grace given. The whole image is one 
of supreme and serene authority.

THE NETHERLANDS: 

WORLD MARKETPLACE 

Such displays of aristocratic power found less favor in the 
sixteenth-century Netherlands. This region, comprising present- 
day Holland and Belgium, had the most turbulent history of any 
country north of the Alps. United under Burgundian rulers in the 
fifteenth century, the Netherlands passed to Habsburg control 
through the marriage of Mary of Burgundy (see fig. 14.18) to 
Maximilian I. When the Reformation began, it was part of the 
empire under their grandson, Charles V, who also inherited the 
crown of Spain. Protestantism quickly gained adherents in the 
Northern Netherlands, and attempts to suppress the spread of 
reform led to a revolt there against Spanish rule that resulted in 
the provinces of the Northern Netherlands declaring their inde¬ 
pendence in 1579. After a bloody struggle, the Northern 
Provinces (present-day Holland) emerged at the end of the 
century as an independent state in all but name. 

The Southern Provinces (roughly corresponding to present- 
day Belgium) remained in Spanish hands and committed to 
Roman Catholicism. To govern the Netherlands, both Charles V 
and Philip II of Spain appointed regents who established courts in 
the southern cities. Economic changes accompanied the momentous 


changes in the political and religious situation. In the Southern 
Netherlands, the once-thriving port of Bruges silted up and was 
replaced as a commercial center by Antwerp, with its deep harbor 
and strategic location. Antwerp became the commercial and 
artistic capital of the Southern Netherlands. In the Northern 
Netherlands the city of Amsterdam became a center of inter¬ 
national trade. 

One byproduct of the religious strife was the destruction of 
works of art in waves of iconoclasm, inspired by the reformers’ 
suspicion of images. In both the Northern and Southern 
Netherlands, vast numbers of medieval and earlier Renaissance 
works of art were lost, especially religious works and sculptures, 
as zealous reformers confiscated or burned images they consid¬ 
ered idolatrous. The market for sculpture in the Netherlands was 
effectively destroyed for the rest of the early modern period, as 
painting and other two-dimensional art forms came to dominate 
artistic production. Although some reformers allowed painted or 
printed images that taught the faithful about doctrine, the 
Catholic practice of commissioning large-scale sculptures of 
saints or of the Virgin to install in churches was eliminated. 
Artists’ practices changed under these conditions; as religious 
commissions dried up, especially in the Northern Netherlands, 
artists no longer waited for patrons to hire them, but made works 
of art to sell in the open market instead. (See The Art Historian's

650 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 








The Economics of Art 


A s trade, specialization, and a money economy came to dominate 
northern Europe after the Middle Ages, the business of making 
and selling art changed. The patron-artist relationship, where a con¬ 
tract specified the work to be produced and the money to be paid, 
gave way to the modern market system, with artists beginning to make 
their goods for sale on the open market. In recent years, art historians 
have been researching and writing about this change in the econom¬ 
ics of art, focusing on centers such as Bruges, Antwerp, Delft, 
Haarlem, and Amsterdam. 

Scholars have used documents, such as chronicles, receipts, and 
contracts and the works themselves to explore the institutions that 
arose in response to these economic changes. The study of guilds and 
their regulation of the art trade illuminates one facet of the econom¬ 
ics of art: Since the Middle Ages, these organizations had regulated 
the training of artists and their commercial activity and had controlled 
competition in their locales. The new technology of prints allowed 
artists to mass-produce images that were not regulated by the guilds; 
prints were available for purchase at trade fairs along with other com¬ 
modities, sometimes by monks and nuns who sold them to support 


their monasteries. Durer financed his trip from Nuremberg to Antwerp 
in 1 521 by selling prints along the way. 

By tracking the fluctuations in prices of works of art in the early 
modern period, scholars have been able to compare them to other 
commodities and to examine the impact of economic changes in the 
art trade on the artists themselves. Researchers have also explored the 
records and the physical arrangements of the marketplaces and neigh¬ 
borhoods where the artists displayed their work for buyers to examine 
and purchase them. Along with economic changes in the art trade a 
new player entered the art market—the dealer, who served as the 
middleman between the artist and the purchaser. 

For art historians, an important issue is how these new economic 
changes and circumstances for making and selling art would affect the 
artworks themselves. Evidence indicates that artists and workshops 
standardized their production techniques, subcontracted specific 
elements of projects, and specialized in particular forms or subjects. 
The choices made for subject matter in works of art responded to 
economic changes, too; images such as Aertsen’s The Meat Stoll (see 
fig. 1 8.31) represent and comment on the market itself. 



\A

Lens , above.) One result was the development of new genres of 
art that would supplement, and eventually replace, traditional 
religious subjects. 

To these challenges concerning subject matter and patronage 
should be added the challenge represented by the new Italianate 
style, which quickly gained favor in the courts. Responses to 
Italian style varied. Some artists saw no reason to change the 
northern European visual tradition they had inherited; some 
grafted Italianate decorative forms to their traditional composi¬ 
tions and techniques; and others dove deeply into Italian style. 
The latter were inspired by the example of Durer, by works of 
Michelangelo and Raphael they had seen in the Netherlands, and 
by their own experience of Italy. 

The City and the Court: David and Gossaert 

The city of Bruges in the Catholic Southern Netherlands 
remained an important center for commerce into the sixteenth 
century, though much of its trade and prosperity transferred to 
Antwerp early in the period. Gerard David (ca. 1460-1523) car¬ 
ried on the distinguished tradition of Bruges painting established 
in the work of Van Eyck and Memling. David s workshop domi¬ 
nated the city to the middle of the sixteenth century. His style 
may be examined in a work he gave to the Carmelite nunnery in 
Bruges in 1509. This painting (fig. 18.27) depicts the Virgin and 
Child surrounded by virgin saints; two angels serenade this 
assembly of women, while portraits of David and his wife, 
Cornelia Cnoop, appear in the corners. In traditional Flemish 
fashion, the forms exhibit detailed renderings of textures, layers 
of colors that create brilliant effects, and symbolic forms to 


enhance the meaning, such as the grapes held by the Christ Child 
and the attributes of the saints. Yet David s cool colors and soft 
modeling endow these figures with a calm dignity that is 
enhanced by the balanced composition. These silent virgins gather 
around the mother and son as the nuns of the convent would 
gather for prayer. 

David worked for both individual patrons and the open mar¬ 
ket, but some of his contemporaries found employment in the 
aristocratic courts of the Netherlands, including Jan Gossaert 
(ca. 1478-1532), nicknamed “Mabuse,” for his hometown of 
Maubeuge. His early career was spent in Antwerp, but in 1508 he 
accompanied Admiral Philip of Burgundy to Italy, where the 
Italian Renaissance and antiquity made a deep impression on him. 
He also worked for the regent of the Netherlands, Margaret of 
Austria. His paintings fuse the lessons of Italian monumentality 
with the detailed technique of the Netherlandish tradition. 

For the castle of his patron Philip of Burgundy he made 
images of mythological subjects, including the Neptune and 
Amphitrite (fig. 18.28), signed and dated by Gossaert in 1516. The 
painting displays the painters fascination with antiquity and 
Italianate perspective, as well as his skill at rendering textures, 
details, and rich color, in the Netherlandish tradition. Gossaert 
here depicts the god and his consort as nudes, basing their 
postures on Durer s 1504 Adam and Eve (see fig. 18.15). Gossaert 
endows these figures with bulky proportions that derive from his 
study in Rome of Hellenistic statues like the Laocoon (see page 
183). The architecture, too, stems from ancient models, but it has 
a severity and a simplicity that are indebted to Bramante (see fig. 
16.8). Gossaert places his figures in a templelike structure, but he 
gives them an impossible scale: Neptune stands as tall as the

columns. Either they are ancient cult statues come to life, or a 
viewer witnesses an epiphany (sudden appearance) of the pagan 
divinities. This subject, the god of the sea, clearly reflects Admiral 
Philip s interests. Gossaert brings Italianate forms to the service of 
his Netherlandish audience in a hybrid of the two traditions. 

Antwerp: Merchants, Markets, and Morality 

Bruges’ decline as a center for commerce occurred as Antwerp 
rose to prominence, which brought it new wealth and the desire 
for a new form of expression of that wealth. As in earlier 
Netherlandish cities, the town hall was the most important civic 
structure, and in midcentury, the city held a competition for a 
new design. Cornelis Floris (1514-1575), a local sculptor and 
architect, won the commission and began work in 1561. Floris 


had traveled to Italy and had studied both ancient and contempo¬ 
rary Italian architecture. In the design for the Antwerp town hall, 
he combined the precepts of Italian Renaissance architecture with 
northern European traditions to create the large and imposing 
structure (fig. 18.29). The building uses Italian devices: The base 
is a rusticated arcade, like Ammanati s Palazzo Pitti (see fig. 17.8); 
the three stories above are articulated with Doric, Ionic, and 
Corinthian columns, like the Colosseum in Rome (see fig. 7.20); a 
central pavilion mixes sculpture and architecture, like a Roman 
triumphal arch (see fig. 7.70). Yet the proportions are vertical, the 
roofline more in keeping with Netherlandish practice, and rich 
carvings on the central pavilion add a focal point at the tall mass 
of this section of the facade. The building integrates Italian ideas 
differently from the way those ideas would be expressed in France 
or Spain (see figs. 18.2 and 18.6). Antwerp had become a global

marketplace by this point, trading a variety of goods, from textiles 
to foodstuffs, all over the world, including the Americas and Asia. 
The visual arts participated in this market in a variety of ways. 
Tapestries were exported through Antwerp; there was a thriving 
market in prints; and the Plantin-Moretus Press produced 
editions of books that were sent all over the world. Painters in 
particular developed new genres of art to tap into this expanding 
market. Still-life, landscape, and genre paintings (images of daily 
life) had been explored by Flemish artists since the rise of the 
International Gothic Style and had become even more important 
during the fifteenth century as backdrops for religious themes. 
Some Antwerp artists of the sixteenth century specialized in these 
themes as subjects in themselves, perhaps in response to the loss 
of religious patronage, or maybe as a way to gain market share. 
These images often carry multiple meanings, at once depicting the 
pleasures of the world, while warning about those same pleasures. 

PATINIR: THE WORLD LANDSCAPE Joachim Patinir (ca. 
1480-1524) was an early specialist in landscape, whose work 
Durer had seen and praised when he visited Antwerp in 1521. 
The Penitence of St. Jerome (fig. 18.30) of about 1518 demon¬ 
strates Patinir s connection to the traditions of Flemish art while 


updating that tradition. He has altered the triptych form to give it 
curved shapes along the top; this form became the fashion for 
triptychs in early sixteenth-century Antwerp. The three wings of 
the triptych depict three different saints, with Jerome in the 
wilderness at the center, and John the Baptist and St. Anthony 
Abbot in the wings; all three were venerated as hermit saints. 
Their figures appear in the foreground, while the continuous land¬ 
scape behind them unites all three panels. The landscape is the true 
subject of Patinir s work. Any narrative is completely subordinate 
to the deep vista of the earth, whose fields, forests, mountains, 
seas, and sky fill most of the panel. The human presence is very 
small in this landscape. Tiny figures wander through this world, 
while villages, cities, even ships can be distinguished in the distance. 

This kind of landscape, which became very popular among 
European collectors in the sixteenth century, has been called a 
“world landscape,” because of the focus on deep vistas into the 
distance. Like Altdorfer, Patinir uses a high viewpoint to allow for 
the distant view, yet he also provides a shelf of space in the fore¬ 
ground for the figures. Creating a smooth relationship between 
the foreground and the distance is of less interest to Patinir than 
describing the craggy blue mountains and the verdant forests. 
How viewers interpreted such landscapes in Patinir s time is not

entirely clear. On the one hand, the vista itself invites careful 
perusal, and viewers could study the picture and imagine the dis¬ 
tant lands then being explored instead of traveling there them¬ 
selves. At the same time, the painting has a religious subject that 
may have a moralizing message. Perhaps Patinir was commenting 
on the dangers of life in the world compared with the hermit 
saints’ rejection of worldly things. 

AERTSEN’S THE MEAT STALL Scholars have also ascribed 
a moralizing meaning to the still lifes painted by the North 
Netherlandish painter Pieter Aertsen (1507/08-1575). Fie spent 
his early career in Antwerp, then returned to Amsterdam in 1557, 
where he saw first hand the destruction of religious images by 
iconoclasts in 1566. The Meat Stall (fig. 18.31), done in 1551 while 
the artist was still in Antwerp, seems at first glance to be a purely 
secular picture. In the foreground, we see the products for sale in 
a butcher’s shop in overwhelming detail, with tiny human figures 


in the background almost blotted out by the food. A sign to the 
upper right also advertises a farm for sale, so the power of the 
market economy is reflected in the imagery. 

The still-life imagery so dominates the picture that it seems 
independent of the religious subject in the background. But in the 
distance to the left we see Mary and Jesus on the Flight into Egypt 
giving bread to the poor, who are ignored by the worshipers lined 
up for church. To the right is a tavern scene where the excesses of 
the senses are for sale. (Oysters were recognized as an aphro¬ 
disiac.) The eye meanders over the objects on display: some of 
them items of gluttony; some, like the pretzels, eaten during Lent. 
Some of the products may be read as Christian symbols, such as 
the two pairs of crossed fish signifying the Crucifixion. The two 
background scenes suggest different choices a viewer could make: 
a life of dissipation or a life of almsgiving. The foreground with its 
emphasis on items for sale may implicate Antwerp’s principal 
economic activity in these choices.

PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER Aertsens younger contem¬ 
porary and fellow Antwerp resident, Pieter Bruegel the Elder 
(1525/30-1569) used this same device of inverted perspective— 
putting the apparent subject of the picture in the background 
of many of his images. He explored landscape, peasant life, 
and moral allegory in his paintings. Although Bruegel spent his 
career in Antwerp and Brussels, he may have been born near 
s-Hertogenbosch, the home of Hieronymus Bosch. Certainly 
Boschs paintings impressed him deeply, and his work is similarly 
ambiguous in its messages. Bruegel s contemporaries admired his 
wit and his ability to mimic nature, though solid personal infor¬ 
mation about Bruegel is scarce. 

Working as a painter and a designer of prints, he made pictures 
that demonstrate his interest in folk customs and the daily life of 
humble people. Bruegel himself was highly educated and the 
friend of humanists, who, with wealthy merchants, were his main 


clients: Urban elites collected images of the country and the 
people who worked the land. He also made images that many 
scholars have seen as offering a political commentary on the 
Habsburg rule over the Southern Netherlands. Members of the 
Habsburg court also collected his work, but during the turbulent 
climate of the 1560s when Philip II of Spain attempted to quash 
the Protestant rebellion in the Netherlands, Bruegel became fear¬ 
ful that his politically barbed imagery might cause trouble for his 
family. (See Primary Source, page 656.) 

Like his contemporaries who followed Diirer’s example, 
Bruegel traveled to Italy in 1552-53, visiting Rome, Naples, and 
Sicily The famous monuments admired and sketched by other 
northern European artists, however, seem not to have interested 
him. He returned instead with a sheaf of magnificent landscape 
drawings, especially Alpine views. Out of this experience came 
the sweeping landscapes of Bruegel s mature style. The Return of

the Hunters (fig. 18.32) is one of a set of paintings depicting the 
months. (He often composed in series; those in this group were 
owned in 1565, a year after they were painted, by Niclaes 
Jonghelink, an Antwerp merchant.) Such scenes had their origin 
in medieval calendar illustrations, such as those in the Tres Riches 
Heures du Due de Berry (see fig. 14.4). In Bruegels work, how¬ 
ever, nature is more than a setting for human activities. It is the 
main subject of the picture. 

Like Patinir, in The Return of the Hunters Bruegel provides a 
shelf of space in the foreground that moves precipitously into the 
distance toward a far horizon. In the snow-covered landscape, 
human and canine members of a hunting party return to their 
village with their skimpy catch in the gray of a northern winter. 
They move down a hill toward a village, where the water has 
frozen and become a place of recreation and where people rush to 
get back indoors. Human activity is fully integrated into the 
natural landscape in Bruegel s image. 

The Peasant Wedding (fig. 18.33), dated around 1568, is one of 
Bruegel s most memorable scenes of peasant life. His biographer, 
Karel van Mander, reported that Bruegel and his patron Hans 


Franckert often disguised themselves as peasants and joined in 
their revelries so Bruegel could observe and sketch them. (See 
Primary Source , page 656.) In this painting Bruegel depicts a 
gathering of rustic people in a barn that has been decorated for 
a wedding. He has totally mastered Italian perspective, so the 
viewer enters a capacious room dominated by the table at which 
the wedding guests are gathered. The bride sits before a green 
curtain to distinguish her, though it is more difficult to identify 
the groom. Food is being distributed in the foreground, while the 
many empty jugs in the lower left suggest that much liquid has 
already been consumed. A far cry from the varieties of meats and 
fish depicted in Aertsens The Meat Stall , the only food here is 
simple porridge. Bagpipers stand ready to play, but the noise level 
already seems high with so many figures talking amid the clatter¬ 
ing of pottery. Bruegel s technique is as precise and detailed as that 
of many of his Flemish predecessors, and his figures have a weight 
and solidity that adds to the impression of reality. 

Bruegel s images of peasants have presented challenges to art 
historians. Some scholars have seen Bruegel s peasant pictures as 
brutal caricatures of rural folk for the consumption of town

dwellers; by this reading, urbane townsfolk could use them to 
chuckle at the foibles of their country cousins. Still, Bruegel treats 
this country wedding as a serious event, and if he records the peas¬ 
ants’ rough manners, he also records their fellowship. He treats the 
least of the least, like the child licking a bowl in the foreground, as 
worthy of observation and remembrance. For Bruegel, the com¬ 
mon man occupies an important place in the scheme of things. 

Many of Bruegel s pictures offer ambivalent lessons, some 
of them based on the proverbial wisdom that permeates 
Netherlandish literature. One of his last pictures, The Blind 
Leading the Blind (fig. 18.34), presents just such a visual interpre¬ 
tation of verbal wisdom. Its source is the Gospels (Matthew 
15:12-19). Jesus, speaking of the Pharisees, says, “And if the blind 
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. ” This parable recurs 
in humanistic as well as popular literature, and it appears in at 
least one earlier work by Bruegel. However, the tragic depth of 
Bruegel s image gives urgency to the theme. He uses the detailed 
rendering of the Netherlandish tradition to record the infirmities 


and the poverty of the blind beggars who march across this village 
landscape. The pose of each figure as a viewers eye proceeds 
along the downward diagonal is less stable than the last one, leav¬ 
ing little doubt that everyone will end up in the ditch with the 
leader. Above the gap between the two groups, Bruegel places a 
village church, suggesting to some critics that the blindness is 
linked to the ecclesiastical establishment. But other readings are 
possible. For example, the church could be seen as the antidote to 
the mens spiritual blindness. Perhaps Bruegel found the meaning 
of the parable especially appropriate to his time, which was 
marked by religious and political fanaticism. The ambiguity of 
Bruegel s pictures has inspired critics and artists for centuries. 

Bruegel s images offer criticism of the events of his day in a 
style derived from the Netherlandish past. In his time, traditional 
certainties about the world and mans place in it gave way to new 
faiths, new ideas, new political and social orders, and an expand¬ 
ing globe. These changes would have an important impact on 
subsequent centuries.

The Baroque 
in Italy and Spain 


UD 


B aroque art is the exuberant, expressive style most closely 

associated with the seventeenth century. The term itself may come from the 
Portuguese word barroco, referring to an irregular pearl; it means 
contorted, even grotesque, and was intended as a disparaging description of 
the grand, turbulent, dynamic, overwhelming style of seventeenth-century art. Art 


historians remain divided over its application. Should the term 
Baroque only be used for the dominant style of the seventeenth 
century, or should it include other tendencies, such as classicism, 
to which it bears a complex relationship? Should the time frame 
also include the period 1700 to 1750, known as the Rococo? More 
important, is the Baroque distinct from both the Renaissance and 
the modern eras? Although a good case can be made for viewing 
the Baroque as the final phase of the Renaissance, we shall treat it 
as a distinct era. It is the beginning of the early modern period, as 
so many of the concerns that characterize the latter era—issues of 
gender, class, and sexuality—are first explored in it. The desire to 
evoke emotional states by appealing to the senses and to persuade, 
often in dramatic ways, underlies Baroque art. Some of the quali¬ 
ties that characterize the Baroque are grandeur, sensual richness, 
emotional exuberance, tension, movement, and the successful uni¬ 
fication of the various arts. 

The expansive, expressive quality of the Baroque paralleled 
the true expansion of European influence—geographical, political 
and religious—throughout the seventeenth century. The explo¬ 
ration of the New World that began in the sixteenth century, 
mobilized primarily by Spain, Portugal, and England (map 19.1), 
developed in the seventeenth century into colonization, first of 


Detail of figure 19.31, Gianlorenzo Bernini, The Ecstasy of St. Teresa 


the eastern coasts of North and South America, and then of 
Polynesia and Asia. The Dutch East India Company developed 
trade with the East and was headquartered in Indonesia. Jesuit 
missionaries traveled to Japan, China, and India, and settled in 
areas of North and South America. In style and spirit, the reach 
of the Baroque was global. 

The Baroque has been called a style of persuasion, as the 
Catholic Church attempted to use art to speak to the faithful and 
to express the spirit of the Counter-Reformation. In the sixteenth 
century, the Church tried to halt the spread of Protestantism in 
Europe; by the seventeenth century, it had declared this effort a 
success and was celebrating its triumph. Private influential fami¬ 
lies, some of whom would later claim a pope as a member, other 
private patrons, and ecclesiastical orders (Jesuits, Theatines, 
Carmelites, and Oratorians), each built new and often large 
churches in Rome in the seventeenth century. And the largest 
building program of the Renaissance—the rebuilding of St. 
Peter s—would finally come to an end, its elaborate decoration 
profoundly reflecting the new glory of the Roman Church. 

This reinvigoration of the Catholic Church began a wave of 
canonizations that lasted through the mid-eighteenth century. 
The religious heroes of the Counter-Reformation—Ignatius of 
Loyola, Francis Xavier (both Jesuits), Teresa of Avila, and Filippo 
Neri—were named saints. (Carlo Borromeo had already been 
made one in 1610.) In contrast to the piety and good deeds of 
these reformers, the new princes of the Church were vigorous

patrons of the arts, both seeking glory for the Church and 
posthumous fame for their own families. 

During the first half of the seventeenth century, Europe was 
torn by almost continuous warfare, which involved almost every 
European nation in a complex web of shifting alliances. The 
Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) was fueled by the ambitions of the 
kings of France, who sought to dominate Europe, and the 
Habsburgs, who ruled not only Austria and Spain but also the 
Southern Netherlands, Bohemia, and Hungary. Although fought 
largely in Germany, the war eventually engulfed nearly all of 
Europe. After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 ended the war and 
formally granted their freedom, the United Provinces—or the 
Dutch Republic as the independent Netherlands were now 
known—entered into a series of battles with England and France 
that lasted until 1679. Yet, other than in Germany, which was 
fragmented into over 300 little states, many in financial ruin, there 


is little correlation between these rivalries and the art of the 
period. In fact, the seventeenth century has been called the 
Golden Age of Painting in France, Spain, and both the Dutch 
Republic and the Southern Netherlands. 

The Baroque has also been identified as “the style of abso¬ 
lutism,” reflecting the centralized state ruled by an autocrat of 
unlimited powers. In the latter half of the seventeenth century, 
Baroque palaces were built on an increasingly monumental scale 
to display the power and grandeur of their owners. Architecture 
emphasized massiveness, dramatic spaces and lighting, rich inte¬ 
rior decoration from floor to ceiling, and luxurious materials; and 
it was meant as a reflection of political and economic power. 
Absolutism reached its climax during the reign of the French 
king Louis XIV in the late seventeenth century, and is seen in his 
palace at Versailles, with its grandiose combination of architec¬ 
ture, painting, decoration, and extensive gardens. But we can also 


662 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 












associate absolutism with the Vatican, the power of the pope and 
his claim of authority won and reestablished through the 
Counter-Reformation. The power of absolutism suggests a style 
that will overwhelm and inspire awe in the spectator. The new 
style was not specifically Italian, even though it was born in Rome 
during the final years of the sixteenth century. Nor was it con¬ 
fined to religious art. Baroque elements of dramatic lighting and 
sweeping gestures entered the vocabulary of northern European 
art. The introduction of new subject matter was a vital addition. 
Still life, the genre scene, and the landscape quickly entered the art 
world of the Protestant north through etchings and paintings. 
Still-life paintings and landscapes were informed by the scientific 
observation of nature. 

A recognition of the subtle relationship between Baroque art 
and science is essential to an understanding of the age. The com¬ 
plex metaphysics of the humanists, which gave everything reli¬ 
gious meaning, was replaced by a new physics. The change began 
with Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei, 
and culminated in Rene Descartes and Isaac Newton. Their cos¬ 
mology brought scientific understanding to sensory perception. 
By placing the sun, not the earth (and humanity), at the center of 
the universe, it contradicted what our eyes (and common sense) 
tell us: that the sun revolves around the earth. Not only was the 
seventeenth century’s worldview fundamentally different from 
the Renaissance’s, but its understanding of visual reality was for¬ 
ever changed by the new science, thanks to advances in optical 
physics and physiology. These scientists knew or corresponded 
with each other and with the artists of their time, and their views 
and discoveries were known to the larger intellectual and artistic 
community. Newtons mathematics were known to Sir 
Christopher Wren and were possibly used in his rebuilding both 
of London and St. Pauls cathedral (see Chapter 21). Vermeer, 
who experimented with optical effects (see Chapter 20), would 
have known the developer of the microscope, Antonie van 
Leeuwenhoek, and the philosopher and scientist Descartes had 
his portrait painted by Lrans Hals. Descartes postponed the 
publication of his own controversial work The World until after 
his death, as he had learned of Galileo s imprisonment and was 
also concerned for his own eternal soul, for he, too, was a 
Catholic and feared excommunication. Galileos scientific and 
religious adversaries, the Jesuits, considered his views to be the 
antithesis of the Church’s teachings; also opposing Galileo was 
Pope Urban VIII (Barberini), the same pope who envisioned a 
new Rome, and who was the most significant patron of Bernini. 
Seventeenth-century ceiling paintings, filled with astronomical 
and astrological figures so prominent in the Baroque, were exe¬ 
cuted to convey the all-encompassing power of the patron, who 
by implication controlled the very heavens above. 

The rise of science also had the effect of displacing natural 
magic, a precursor of modern science that included both astrology 
and alchemy. Unlike the new science, natural magic tried to 
control the world through prediction and manipulation; it did so 
by uncovering nature’s “secrets” instead of its physical laws. 
Yet, because it was linked to religion and morality, natural magic 


lived on in popular literature and folklore well beyond the seven¬ 
teenth century. 

Lolklore, literature, and contemporary theater became 
subjects for the visual arts in the Baroque, usually depicted in 
genre scenes—scenes from everyday life—which became popular 
in the seventeenth century. These genre paintings include scenes 
of men and women in domestic situations, eating, drinking, 
smoking, and playing board games and musical instruments. 
Sometimes they illustrate proverbs and the senses. But they 
should not be confused with “reality” as they are artistic inven¬ 
tions. The paintings are often moralizing; that is, they often warn 
against the very things they are depicting! Such paintings were 
already being executed in the sixteenth century (see fig. 18.34), 
but in the seventeenth century they develop into a major force, 
along with landscape and still-life painting, in nearly every 
European country—in Italy, Spain, Elanders, the Dutch Republic, 
and France. Paintings of foodstuffs—plain and exotic—and 
landscapes of rural, urban, or far-off places were popular. Turkish 
carpets, African elephants and lions, Brazilian parrots, Chinese 
Ming vases, and peoples from Africa, India, and South America 
can be found in seventeenth-century art. If this sounds like a list 
of “exotica”—that is because the exotic was a major part of the 
seventeenth-century experience, as people, many of them artists, 
began to travel to faraway places. Paintings provide us with a 
gateway into the Baroque world. 

In the end, Baroque art was not simply the result of religious, 
political, intellectual, or social developments: The strengthened 
Catholic faith, the absolutist state, the new science, and the begin¬ 
nings of the modern world combined in a volatile mixture that 
gave the Baroque era its fascinating variety. What ultimately 
unites this complex era is a reevaluation of humanity and its rela¬ 
tion to the universe. Philosophers gave greater prominence to the 
human passions, which encompassed a wider range of emotions 
and social levels than before. The scientific revolution leading up 
to Newton’s unified mechanics in physics responded to this same 
new view of humanity, which presumes a more active role for 
people through their ability to understand and affect the world 
around them. Remarkably, the early modern period remained an 
age of great religious faith, however divided people may have 
been in their loyalties. The interplay of passions, intellect, and 
spirituality may be seen as forming a dialogue that has never been 
truly resolved. 

PAINTING IN ITALY 

Around 1600, Rome became the fountainhead of the Baroque, as 
it had of the High Renaissance a century before, by attracting 
artists from other regions. The papacy and many of the new 
Church orders (Jesuits, Theatines, and Oratorians), as well as 
numerous private patrons from wealthy and influential families 
(Farnese, Barberini, and Pamphili), commissioned art on a large 
scale, with the aim of promoting themselves and making Rome 
the most beautiful city in the Christian world “for the greater 


CHAPTER 1 9 THE BAROQUE IN ITALY AND SPAIN 663 



glory of God and the Church. ” This campaign had begun as early 
as 1585 (indeed, we may even date this revitalization to the reign 
of Julius II); by the opening of the seventeenth century, Rome had 
attracted hosts of ambitious young artists, especially from north¬ 
ern Italy. It was they who created the new style. 

Caravaggio and the New Style 

Foremost among the young artists was the revolutionary painter 
Michelangelo Merisi (1571-1610), called Caravaggio after his 
family’s hometown near Milan. After his training, begun at age 
13, under a minor Milanese painter, he came to Rome in 1592 or 
1593 and worked as an assistant to various artists before setting 
out on his own. His style of painting, his new subjects, his use of 
lighting, and his concept of naturalism were to change the world 
of painting. 

According to contemporary accounts, Caravaggio painted 
directly on the canvas, and he worked from live models. He 
depicted the world he knew, so that his canvases are filled 
with ordinary people. They are not idealized as High Renais¬ 
sance figures, nor given classical bodies, clean clothes, and 
perfect features. But neither are they distorted, elongated, or 
overtly elegant as in Mannerism. This was an entirely new 



1 9.1 Contarelli Chapel, San Luigi dei Francesi, Rome 


conception that was raw, immediate, and palpable. Caravaggio s 
style initiated the Baroque and caused a stir in the art world. (See 
www.myartslab.com. ) He had numerous followers and imitators, 
and critics, both Italian and northern European, wrote of his 
work, so Caravaggio and his paintings became internationally 
known almost immediately. 

Caravaggio s first important public commission was a series of 
three monumental canvases devoted to St. Matthew that he 
painted for the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei 
Francesi between 1599 and 1602 (fig. 19.1). This church for the 
French (“dei Francesi”) in Rome, founded in 1518 by Cardinal 
Giulio de’ Medici (later Pope Clement VII) and designed by 
Giacomo della Porta, was finished in 1589. The Chapel of St. 
Louis (Luigi) was endowed by the French cardinal Mathieu 
Contrel (Contarelli) in 1565, but the decoration was not com¬ 
pleted at the time. More than 30 years later, Caravaggio received 
the commission to finish the work through the intervention of his 
patron, Cardinal del Monte. 

As decorations, the three Contarelli paintings perform the 
same function that fresco cycles had in the Renaissance—each 
complements the others to fill out the narrative. In the chapel 
view, we see St. Matthew and the Angel , in which the tax collector 
Matthew turns dramatically for inspiration to the angel who dic¬ 
tates the gospel. The main image on the left in the chapel is The 
Calling of St. Matthew (fig. 19.2) which depicts the moment 
Matthew is chosen by Christ. The third canvas (on the right, but 
not seen here) is devoted to the saint s martyrdom. 

The Calling of St. Matthew displays a naturalism that is both 
new and radical. Naturalism was not an end in itself for Cara¬ 
vaggio, but a means of conveying profoundly spiritual content. 
Never before have we seen a sacred subject depicted so entirely in 
terms of contemporary lowlife. Matthew, the well-dressed tax 
collector, sits with some armed men, who must be his agents, in a 
common, sparse room. The setting and costumes must have been 
very familiar to Caravaggio. Two figures approach from the right. 
The arrival s bare feet and simple biblical garb contrast strongly 
with the colorful costumes of Matthew and his companions. 

Why do we sense a religious quality in this scene and not mis¬ 
take it for an everyday event? What identifies one of the figures 
on the right as Christ, who has come to Matthew and says 
“Follow me”? It is surely not his halo, the only supernatural 
feature in the picture, which is a thin gold band that we might 
easily overlook. Our eyes fasten instead on his commanding 
gesture, borrowed from Michelangelo s Adam in The Creation of 
Adam (see fig. 16.21), which bridges the gap between the two 
groups of people and is echoed by Matthew, who points question- 
ingly at himself. 

The men on our left at the table seem not to be engaged in the 
unfolding drama, as they concentrate on the money being 
counted. In shadow, they are blind to the entrance of Christ—one 
even wears eyeglasses. Caravaggio uses the piercing light in this 
scene to announce Christ s presence, as Christ himself brought 
light: “I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not 
walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12.)

The beam of sunlight in the darkness above Jesus is most deci¬ 
sive in determining the work s meaning and style. This strong 
beam of light against the dark background is known as a tenebris- 
tic effect, or tenebrism, a style that uses strong contrasts of light 
and dark. Caravaggio illuminates Christ s face and hand in the 
gloomy interior so that we see the precise moment of his calling 
to Matthew and witness a critical piece of religious history and 
personal conversion. Without this light, so natural yet so charged 
with meaning, the picture would lose its power to make us aware 
of the divine presence. Caravaggio gives direct expression to an 


attitude shared by certain saints of the Counter-Reformation: that 
the mysteries of faith are revealed not by speculation but through 
an inner experience that is open to all people. 

Caravaggio s paintings have a quality of “lay Christianity” 
that spoke powerfully to both Catholics and Protestants. Without 
the painting s religious context, the men seated at the table might 
seem like figures in a genre scene. Indeed, Caravaggio s painting 
became a source for secular scenes: Fanciful costumes, with 
slashed sleeves and feathered berets, will appear in the works of 
Caravaggio s followers. Figures seen in half-length (showing only 


CHAPTER 1 9 THE BAROQUE IN ITALY AND SPAIN 665 




the upper half of their bodies) will also be a common element in 
other works by Caravaggio and his followers (see fig. 20.15). 

This intense, vivid tenebrism, the cornerstone of Caravaggio s 
style, can be seen again in his The Conversion of St. Paul (fig. 19.3). 
He employed it to heighten the drama and to suggest divine 
light at the same time. The painting is one of a pair (the other is 
The Crucifixion of St. Peter) in Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome, 
placed to the left and right of the rich, colorful altarpiece of The 
Assumption ofthe Virgin by Annibale Carracci, which Caravaggio 
would have seen before he executed his own work. In contrast to 


that altarpiece, Caravaggio employs muted tones and a nearly 
black background. He uses neither color nor line (indeed, there 
are no known drawings by him) to better indicate the narrative. 
Rather, he uses light to focus, even shock a viewer. A fallen Saul 
(to become St. Paul at his conversion) lies on his back; we 
view him foreshortened, and helpless, as he is struck by the light 
of God. The light also reveals the flank and mane of his huge 
horse, which takes up most of the space. The intense raking light 
from an unseen source at the left is used to model forms and 
create textures. The figures are nearly too big for the space.

They overwhelm us as we imagine them larger and only partly 
revealed by the light. The selective highlighting endows the life- 
size figures with a startling presence and theatricality typical of 
the Baroque. 

Another aspect of Caravaggio’s work is his focus on the sen¬ 
sual and erotic nature of both music and young men, who are 
depicted as seducing and soliciting. We see these elements in The 
Musicians (fig. 19.4), with its four androgynous, seminude youths. 
Actually, it has been suggested that the painting shows two 
youths seen from two points of view. The musicians are half- 
length, but life-size; their blushed cheeks and full lips suggest 
erotic, sensual pleasures, enjoyed with each other and offered to a 
particular viewer. That viewer (the patron) was Cardinal del 
Monte, the influential, cultured patron and art collector, who 
arranged the St. Matthew commission for Caravaggio and who 
commissioned other homoerotic paintings from him. The lute, 
violin, horn (at back right), and the music sheets surrounding or 
being used by these half-draped men, and even the grapes being 
plucked at the left, suggest a contemporary bacchanal. The erotic 
undertones are part of the sensuality and passion that will be 
explored in the Baroque and frequently imitated in later works of 
art by other artists. 

Highly argumentative, Caravaggio carried a sword and was 
often in trouble with the law for fighting. When he killed a friend 
in a duel over a game, Caravaggio fled Rome and spent the rest of 
his short life on the run. He first went to Naples, then Malta, then 
returned briefly to Naples. These trips account for both his work 
in these cities and his lasting influence there. He died traveling 
back to Rome, where he hoped to gain a pardon. In Italy, 
Caravaggio s work was praised by artists and connoisseurs—and 


also criticized. Conservatives regarded Caravaggio and his work 
as lacking decorum: the propriety and reverence that religious 
subjects demanded. But many who did not like Caravaggio as 
a man were nevertheless influenced by his work and had to con¬ 
cede that his style was pervasive. The power of his style and 
imagery lasted into the 1630s, when it was absorbed into other 
Baroque tendencies. 

Artemisia Gentileschi 

Born in Rome, Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-ca. 1653) was the 
daughter of Caravaggios friend, follower, and rival Orazio 
Gentileschi, and grew up in this artistic milieu. She became one of 
the major painters of her day and was the first woman to be 
admitted to the Accademia del Disegno in Florence. Nonetheless, 
it was difficult for a woman artist to make her way professionally. 
In a letter of 1649 (see Primary Source , page 669), she wrote that 
“people have cheated me” after she had submitted a drawing to a 
patron only to have him commission “another painter to do the 
painting using my work. If I were a man, I can’t imagine it would 
have turned out this way” Her best-known subjects are biblical 
heroines: Bathsheba, the tragic object of King David’s passion, 
and Judith, who saved her people by beheading Holofernes. Both 
themes (see fig. 20.25) were popular during the Baroque era, 
which delighted in erotic and violent scenes. Artemisia’s frequent 
depictions of these women (she often portrayed herself in the 
lead role) suggest an ambivalence toward men that was rooted in 
her turbulent life. (Artemisia was raped by her teacher, Agostino 
Tassi [see fig. 19.10], who was tried and sentenced to banishment 
from Rome.)

Artemisia’s Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of 
Holo femes (fig. 19.5) is a fully mature, independent, dramatic, and 
large work, no less powerful for its restraint. The theme is the 
apocryphal story of the Jewish widow Judith, who saved her peo¬ 
ple by traveling with her maid to the tent of the Assyrian general 
Holofernes (who was about to lead an attack on the Jews), got 
him drunk, and then cut off his head with his own sword. It yields 
parallels to the story of David and Goliath—might conquered by 
virtue and innocence. However, in the case of Judith slaying 


Holofernes, the victor was not always seen positively, but with 
some suspicion since her triumph was one of deceit: Having 
entered his tent and offered him drink, Judith then killed her foe. 
The unspoken promise of sexual activity was never realized. 
Here, rather than the beheading itself, the artist shows the instant 
after. Momentarily distracted, Judith gestures theatrically as her 
servant stuffs Holofernes s head into a sack. The object of their 
attention remains hidden from view, heightening the air of sus¬ 
pense and intrigue. The hushed, candlelit atmosphere—tenebrism

Artemisia Gentileschi 
(1593-ca. 1653) 

From a letter to Don Antonio Ruffo 

Artemisia Gentileschi’s letter of November 13, 1649 reveals the 
relationship of the painter to her patron and casts light on issues of orig¬ 
inality, of price, and of working with models. Throughout, the letter 
discloses Artemisia's acute awareness and even contempt for those who 
treated her less fairly because she was a woman. 

I have received a letter of October 26th, which I deeply appreciated, 
particularly noting how my master always concerns himself with 
favoring me, contrary to my merit. In it, you tell me about that gentle¬ 
man who wishes to have some paintings by me, that he would like a 
Galatea and a Judgment of Paris, and that the Galatea should be dif¬ 
ferent from the one that Your Most Illustrious Lordship owns. There 
was no need for you to urge me to do this, since by the grace of God 
and the Most Holy Virgin, they [clients] come to a woman with this 
kind of talent, that is, to vary the subjects in my painting; never has 
anyone found in my pictures any repetition of invention, not even of 
one hand. 

As for the fact that this gentleman wishes to know the price before 
the work is done ... I do it most unwillingly ... I never quote a price 


for my works until they are done. However, since Your Most 
Illustrious Lordship wants me to do this, I will do what you com¬ 
mand. Tell this gentleman that I want five hundred ducats for both; 
he can show them to the whole world and, should he find anyone 
who does not think the paintings are worth two hundred scudi more, 
I won’t ask him to pay me the agreed price. I assure Your Most 
Illustrious Lordship that these are paintings with nude figures requir¬ 
ing very expensive female models, which is a big headache. When I 
find good ones they fleece me, and at other times, one must suffer 
[their] pettiness with the patience of Job. 

As for my doing a drawing and sending it, I have made a solemn 
vow never to send my drawings because people have cheated me. 
In particular, just today I found ... that, having done a drawing of 
souls in Purgatory for the Bishop of St. Gata, he, in order to spend 
less, commissioned another painter to do the painting using my 
work. If I were a man, I can’t imagine it would have turned out 
this way. ... 

I must caution Your Most Illustrious Lordship that when I ask a 
price, I don’t follow the custom in Naples, where they ask thirty and 
then give it for four. I am Roman, and therefore I shall act always in 
the Roman manner.

made intimate—creates a mood of mystery that conveys Judith’s 
complex emotions with unsurpassed understanding. Gentileschi’s 
rich palette, seen here, was to have a strong influence on painting 
in Naples, where she settled in 1630. 

We know that, possibly for a few years (ca. 1638-40), 
Artemisia also worked in London where her father had been 
court painter to Charles I of England from 1626 to 1639. Indeed, 
several of her paintings were recorded in the king’s inventory after 
his execution, and father and daughter may have worked together 
on a project in Greenwich. Among her most daring and creative 
works is Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (fig. 19.6), one of 
the most innovative self-portraits of the Baroque period. 

Artemisia was able to do here what no male artist could: She 
depicted herself as the allegorical female figure of Painting, La 
Pittura. The dress and activity of the subject conforms to Cesare 
Ripa’s description of La Pittura in his popular Iconologia (1593), 
a book of allegories and symbolic emblems for artists. There, the 
allegorical figure of Painting is described, in part, as a beautiful 
woman, with disheveled black hair, wearing a gold chain which 
hangs from her neck, and holding a brush in one hand and a 
palette in the other. Thus, the painting asserts Artemisia’s unique 
role as a woman painter—representing not just herself, but all of 
Painting and reflecting the new, elevated status of artists.

Ceiling Painting and Annibale Carracci 

The conservative tastes of many Italian patrons were met by 
artists who were less radical than Caravaggio, and who continued 
a more classical tradition steeped in High Renaissance ideals. 
They took their lead from Annibale Carracci (1560-1609), who 
arrived in Rome in 1595. Annibale came from Bologna where, in 
the 1580s, he and two other members of his family formed an 
“Academy” (also see Vasari, page 601, and Goltzius, page 713) and 


evolved an anti-Mannerist style based on northern Italian realism 
and Venetian art. He was a reformer rather than a revolutionary. 
Although we do not know completely what this “Academy” 
entailed, it seems to have incorporated drawing live models and 
ancient sculpture. As with Caravaggio, his experience of Roman 
classicism transformed his art. He, too, felt that painting must 
return to nature, but his approach emphasized a revival of the 
classics, which to him meant the art of antiquity Annibale also 


670 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






sought to emulate Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, and Correggio. 
In his best work, he was able to fuse these diverse elements. 

Between 1597 and 1601 Annibale produced a ceiling fresco, 
Loves of the Gods , in the gallery of the Farnese Palace (fig. 19.7), 
his most ambitious work, which soon became so famous that it 
ranked behind only the murals of Michelangelo and Raphael. 
Although we have seen ceiling painting in the Renaissance—from 
the fifteenth through the sixteenth centuries, with works by 
Mantegna, Correggio, and of course Michelangelo, whose paint¬ 
ing of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel would become the work 
against which all others would be judged—it is the Baroque 
period which is most associated with this form of painting. 

Executed in chapels, churches, and private residences—in 
entranceways, hallways, and dining rooms—ceiling painting was 
meant to convey the power, domination, or even extravagance of 
the patron. One could not enter such a painted room without 
feeling a little awe. The styles of such works becomes increasingly 
extravagant from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the 
end and rivals even the majesty of Michelangelo. The Farnese 
Palace ceiling, commissioned to celebrate a family wedding, dis¬ 
plays a humanist subject, the loves of the classical gods. As on the 
Sistine Chapel ceiling, the narrative scenes are surrounded by 
painted architecture, simulated sculpture, and nude youths, care¬ 
fully foreshortened and lit from below so that they appear real. 
But the fresco does not rely solely on Michelangelo s masterpiece 
for inspiration. The main panels are presented as easel pictures, a 
solution adopted from Raphael. Although the ceiling is painted in 
fresco, these paintings are given “frames” to appear as easel paint¬ 
ings transported to the ceiling. This device is known as quadri 


riportati (singular is quadro riportato). The ceiling “easel paint¬ 
ings,” “medallions” and “sculpture” are painted as trompe-Poeil. 
There is no regard for the spectator s point of view here. (When 
the viewpoint of the spectator is considered, then the artist is 
using “di sotto in su” —literally, “from below to above”; see figs. 
15.50 and 17.27.) This imagery on the ceiling reflects the collec¬ 
tion of the Farnese—paintings, medallions, sculpture—on display 
in the room and elsewhere. The figure of Polyphemus, hurling the 
stone in the “easel painting” on the short wall, is based on the 
Farnese Hercules , a Hellenistic sculpture owned by the family and 
displayed in the courtyard. (This same sculpture is the subject of 
fig. 20.14.) The ceiling is held together by an illusionistic scheme 
that reflects Annibales knowledge of Correggio (see fig. 17.27) 
and Veronese (see fig. 17.38). Each level of reality is handled with 
consummate skill, and the entire ceiling has an exuberance that 
sets it apart from both Mannerism and High Renaissance art. 

The sculptured precision of the Farnese ceiling shows us only 
one side of Annibale Carracci s style. Another important aspect is 
seen in his landscapes, such as the Landscape with the Flight into 
Egypt (fig. 19.8). Its pastoral mood and soft light and atmosphere 
hark back to Giorgione and Titian (see figs. 16.29 and 16.30). The 
figures play a minor role here: They are as small and incidental in 
the manner of a northern European landscape (see fig. 18.30). The 
painting only hints at the biblical theme of the Flight into Egypt 
(there are some camels on the hillside). Indeed, the landscape 
would be equally suitable as a backdrop for almost any story. 
The old castle, the roads and fields, the flock of sheep, the ferry¬ 
man with his boat—all show that this “civilized,” hospitable 
countryside has been inhabited for a long time. Hence the figures,

however tiny, do not appear lost or dwarfed. This firmly con¬ 
structed “ideal landscape” evokes a vision of nature that is gentle 
yet austere, grand but not awesome. 

GUIDO RENI AND GUERCINO Baroque ceilings, which began 
with Annibale Carraccis illusionistic ceiling for the Farnese 
Palace, continued in Rome with Annibale s Bolognese followers 
Guido Reni (1575-1642) and Giovanni Francesco Barbieri 
(1591-1666), called Guercino. Guercino was the leader of the 
Bolognese School of painting, but both he and Reni worked in 
Rome and executed ceilings in the second and third decades of the 
seventeenth century. 

Annibale s Farnese Gallery seemed to offer two alternatives to 
them and others inspired by it. Adopting the Raphaelesque style 
of the mythological panels, they could arrive at a deliberate, offi¬ 
cial classicism of quadro riportato ; or they could take their cue 
instead from the illusionism of the framework. Approaches varied 
according to personal style and the specific site. Among the earli¬ 
est examples of the first alternative is Reni s quadro riportato ceil¬ 
ing fresco Aurora (fig. 19.9), which shows Apollo in his chariot 
(the sun) led by Aurora (the dawn). Here, elegantly drawn grace 
becomes the pursuit of perfect beauty. The relieflike design 
with its glowing colors and dramatic light gives the painting an 
emotional force that the figures alone could never achieve. This 
style is called Baroque classicism to distinguish it from earlier 
forms of classicism. 

Another Aurora ceiling (fig. 19.10), painted less than ten years 
later by Guercino, is the very opposite of Reni s. Here (in the 
1622 painting), architectural illusionistic framework (painted by 
Agostino Tassi), known as quadratura , combined with the picto¬ 
rial illusionism of Correggio (see fig. 17.27) and the intense light 


and color of Titian, converts the entire surface into one limitless 
space, in which the figures sweep past as if driven by the winds. 
Rather than viewing Aurora in profile as in Reni s ceiling, we are 
clearly positioned below, looking up, seeing the underbelly of the 
horses as they gallop over our heads. With this work, Guercino 
continued and expanded the ceiling painting tradition descended 
from Correggio and started what became a flood of similar visions 
by other artists. The dynamic fulfillment of this style became 
known as the High Baroque, after 1630. 

PIETRO DA CORTONA AND THE BARBERINI CEILING 

The most overpowering of these illusionistic ceilings is the fresco 
by Pietro da Cortona (1596-1669) in the great hall of the 
Barberini Palace in Rome (fig. 19.11). This enormous painting 
combines all three illusionistic systems— quadratura in its painted 
architectural framework, quadri riportati in the scenes on the 
sides, and di sotto in su in setting our point of view (as in our 
image here) to fully understand the ceiling. This work, a complex 
allegory, glorifies the reign of the Barberini pope Urban VIII. 

The allegorical female figure of Divine Providence, its central 
theme, dominates the ceiling, proclaiming that the pope was 
chosen by her and not by political favor. Indeed, a swarm of bees 
(part of the Barberini coat of arms featured prominently in the 
ceiling) was said to have descended on the Vatican just prior to his 
election by the new secret ballot system in the College of 
Cardinals. Allegorical figures in the ceiling emphasize the pope s 
divine position: The Barberini bees are surrounded by the 
Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, while the papal 
tiara is carried by Rome and the keys of St. Peter by Religion. As 
in the Farnese Gallery, the ceiling area is subdivided by a painted 
framework that simulates architecture and sculpture, but beyond

it we now see the limitless sky, as in Guercino’s Aurora. Clusters

as below this framework. They create a dual illusion: Some figures 
appear to hover inside the hall, close to us, while others recede

Cortonas frescoes were the focal point for the rift between the 
High Baroque, the exaggerated, triumphal style of the age, and the 
Baroque classicism that grew out of the Farnese Gallery ceiling. 
The classicists insisted that art served a moral purpose and should 
observe the principles of clarity, unity, and decorum. And, sup¬ 
ported by a tradition based on Horace s adage ut pictura poesis 
(“as is painting, so is poetry”), they maintained that painting 
should follow the example of tragic poetry in conveying meaning 
through a minimum of figures whose movements, gestures, and 
expressions can be easily read. Cortona, while not anti-Classical, 
presented the case instead for art as epic poetry, with many actors 
and episodes that expand on the central theme and create a mag¬ 
nificent effect. He was also the first to argue that art has a sensu¬ 
ous appeal which exists as an end in itself. Although it took place 
largely on a theoretical level, the debate over illusionistic ceiling 
painting was about more than opposing approaches to telling a 
story and expressing ideas in art. The core issue here lies at the 
very heart of the Baroque. Illusionism allowed artists to fuse sep¬ 
arate levels of reality into a pictorial unity of such overwhelming 
grandeur as to sweep aside any differences between them. Despite 
the intensity of the controversy, in practice the two sides rarely 
came into conflict over easel paintings, where the differences 
between Cortona’s and Annibale’s followers were not always so 
clear-cut. Surprisingly, Cortona found inspiration in classical art 
and Raphael throughout his career. The leader of the reaction 
against the “excesses” of the High Baroque was neither a fresco 
painter nor an Italian, but a French artist living in Rome: Nicolas 
Poussin, who moved early on in the same antiquarian circle as 
Cortona but drew very different lessons from it. 

GIOVANNI BATTISTA GAULLI AND IL GESU It is a strange 
fact that few ceiling frescoes were painted after Cortona finished 
his Allegory of Divine Providence. Ironically, the new style of 
architecture fostered by Francesco Borromini and Guarino 
Guarini (see pages 679-83) provided few opportunities for deco¬ 
ration. But, after 1670, such frescoes enjoyed a revival in older 
buildings which reached its peak in the interior of II Gesu (fig. 
19.12), the mother church for the Jesuit order. At the suggestion 
of Gianlorenzo Bernini, the greatest sculptor-architect of the cen¬ 
tury, the commission for the ceiling frescoes went to his young 
protege Giovanni Battista Gaulli (1639-1709). A talented assis¬ 
tant, Antonio Raggi (1624-1686), made the stucco sculpture. The 
program, which proved extraordinarily influential, shows Bernini 
and Gaulli’s imaginative daring. As in the Cornaro Chapel (see 
fig. 19.31), the ceiling is treated as a single unit that evokes a mys¬ 
tical vision. The nave fresco, with its contrasts of light and dark 
and sharply foreshortened figures, spills dramatically over its 
frame, then turns into sculptured figures, combining painting, 
sculpture, and architecture. Here, Baroque illusionism achieves its 


ultimate expression. The subject of the ceiling painting is the 
illuminated name of Jesus—the IHS derived from the first three 
letters of the Greek name of Jesus—in the center of the golden 
light. It is a stirring reference both to the Jesuit order, dedicated to 
the Name of Jesus and to the concept that Christ is the Light of 
the World. The impact of his light and holiness then creates the 
overflowing turbulence that tumbles out of the sky at the end of 
days and spreads the word of the Jesuit missionaries: “That at the 
name of Jesus, every knee should bow...” (Epistle of St. Paul to 
the Philippians 2:10). 

ARCHITECTURE IN ITALY 

The Baroque style in architecture, like that of painting, began in 
Rome, which was a vast construction site from the end of the six¬ 
teenth through the middle of the seventeenth century. The goals 
of the Counter-Reformation caused the Church to embark on a 
major building campaign. New churches were constructed and 
the new St. Peter’s was finally completed. Although many of these 
building projects began during Renaissance, they developed dis¬ 
tinctly different characteristics as they were completed during the 
Baroque. Some architects continued to use a classical vocabulary 
but expanded or stretched it. For instance, the idea of perfection 
was no longer represented by a circle, but an oval or ellipse (a new 
concept that was frequently the object of astronomical discussions). 
They incorporated domes based on Michelangelo’s (see fig. 17.19) 
but which had a steeper profile to suggest greater drama in punc¬ 
tuating the sky; others designed buildings based on amorphous 
shapes that used classical ornamentations but not its principles. 

The Completion of St. Peter’s 
and Carlo Maderno 

Carlo Maderno (ca. 1556-1629) was the most talented young 
architect to emerge in the midst of the vast ecclesiastical building 
program that commenced in Rome toward the end of the six¬ 
teenth century. In 1603, he was given the task of completing, at 
long last, the church of St. Peter’s (fig. 19.13). Pope Clement VIII 
had decided to add a nave and narthex to the west end of 
Michelangelo’s building, thereby converting it into a basilica plan. 
This change, which had already been proposed by Raphael in 
1514, made it possible to link St. Peter’s with the Vatican Palace to 
the right of the church (fig. 19.14). 

Maderno s design for the facade follows the pattern estab¬ 
lished by Michelangelo for the exterior of the church. It consists 
of a colossal order supporting an attic, but with a dramatic 
emphasis on the portals. The effect can only be described as a 
crescendo that builds from the corners toward the center. The 
spacing of the supports becomes closer, the pilasters turn into 
columns, and the facade wall projects step by step. This quickened 
rhythm had been hinted at a generation earlier in Giacomo della 
Porta’s facade for II Gesu (see fig. 17.23). Maderno made it the 
dominant principle of his facade designs, not only for St. Peter’s

Maderno, 1607-12; colonnade by Gianlorenzo Bernini, designed 1657 


but for smaller churches as well. In the process, he replaced the 
traditional concept of the church facade as one continuous wall 
surface, with the “fa^ade-in-depth” becoming dynamically related 
to the open space before it. The possibilities of this new treatment, 
which derives from Michelangelo s Palazzo dei Conservatori (see 
fig. 17.18), were not to be exhausted until 150 years later. Recent 
cleaning of the facade of St. Peter s revealed it to be of a warm 
cream color, which emphasized its sculptural qualities. 

Bernini and St. Peter’s 

After Maderno s death in 1629, his assistant Gianlorenzo Bernini 
(1598-1680) assumed the title “architect of St. Peters.” 
Considering himself Michelangelo s successor as both architect 
and sculptor, Bernini directed the building campaign and coordi¬ 
nated the decoration and sculpture within the church as well. 
Given these tasks, the enormous size of St. Peter s posed equal 
challenges for anyone seeking to integrate architecture and sculp¬ 
ture. How could its vastness be related to the human scale and 
given a measure of emotional warmth? Once the nave was 
extended following Maderno s design, Bernini realized that the 
vast interior needed an internal focal point. His response was to 
create the monumental sculptural/architectural composite form, 
known as the Baldacchino (fig. 19.15), the “canopy” for the main 
altar of St. Peter s, at the very crossing of the transept and the

nave, directly under Michelangelo s dome (see fig. 17.19) and just 
above the actual crypt of St. Peter where the pope would cele¬ 
brate Mass. This nearly 100-foot piece created mostly in bronze 
stripped from the ancient Pantheon (see fig. 7.23) stands on four 
twisted columns, reminiscent of those from the original St. Peter s 
(and thought, too, to replicate those of Solomons Temple). 
Rather than an architectural entablature mounted between the 
columns, Bernini inventively suggests fabric hanging between 
them. He used actual leaves, vines, fruits, and even lizards and cast 
them in bronze for the decoration. The Baldacchino is a splendid 
fusion of sculpture and architecture. At its corners are statues of 
angels and vigorously curved scrolls, which raise a cross above a 
golden orb, the symbol of the triumph of Christianity throughout 
the world. The entire structure is so alive with expressive energy 
that it may be considered as the epitome of Baroque style. In a 
related tribute, we see through the columns of the Baldacchino to 
the sculptural reliquary of the throne of St. Peter, the Cathedra 
Petri in the apse of the church, also designed by Bernini. 

The papal insignia—the triple crown and crossed keys of St. 
Peter—and the coat of arms of the pope under whose patronage 
this structure was created—the Barberini bees of Urban VIII—are 
significant elements of decoration in the Baldacchino. These same 
identifiers can also be seen in Cortonas Barberini ceiling (see fig. 
19.11). Berninis Baldacchino honors not just the power and 
majesty of God, but that of his emissary on earth, the pope. 
Bernini s relationship with the pope was one of the most success¬ 
ful in the history of patronage. Indeed, upon his elevation to the 
papacy, Urban VIII was said to have told the artist: “It is your 
great good luck, Cavaliere, to see Maffeo Barberini pope; but We 
are even luckier in that Cavaliere Bernini lives at the time of our 
pontificate. ” (However, the artistic aims of this pope drained the 
papal treasury and both the pope and, by association, Bernini 
were blamed for the excesses after Urbans death.) As Bernini 
directed our attention within the church, he also (later, under the 
patronage of Pope Alexander VII [r. 1655-1667] orchestrated our 
entrance into St. Peter s. Thus, he molded the open space in front 
of the facade into a magnificent oval piazza that is amazingly 
sculptural (see fig. 19.14). This “forecourt”—an immense key- 
hole-shaped colossal colonnade—imposed a degree of unity on 
the sprawling Vatican complex, while screening off the surround¬ 
ing slums. This device, which Bernini himself likened to the 
motherly, all-embracing arms of the Church, was not new. What 
was novel was the idea of placing it at the main entrance to a 
building. Also unusual was the huge scale. For sheer impressive¬ 
ness, this integration of architecture and grandiose setting can be 
compared only with the ancient Roman sanctuary at Palestrina 
(see fig. 7.5). Bernini s one major failure visually of St. Peter s was 
his inability to execute the bell towers that were initially planned 
by Bramante (see fig. 16.10). He began construction, but, much to 
Bernini s humiliation, cracks appeared, and although these could 
have been the result of normal foundation settling, an inquest was 
convened, and the towers were dismantled. This failure would 
haunt him, but would provide a competitive resource for his 
rivals: Borromini in Italy and later Wren in England. 


Architectural Components in Decoration 

The huge scale, the dynamic sculptural vitality, and the ornamen¬ 
tation of Baroque architecture were expressed in the decorative 
arts as well. The 5-foot-high clock seen in figure 19.16 is made of 
colorful marble, lapis lazuli, black ebony, and gilt bronze, and 
features an oil-on-copper painting. 

Clocks in the seventeenth century were not yet accurate, 
certainly not silent, and rarely readable at night. The novel exam¬ 
ple shown here, however, was known as an orologio della notte 
(nocturnal clock)—a clock that would be useful even at night, 
thanks to an innovative design by Pier Tommaso Campani (active 
ca. 1650- 1700). Bernini had seen a nocturnal clock on his trip to 
France in 1665; it was considered a true marvel. This one was 
made for Pope Alexander VII, a known insomniac, who 
requested a clock that could display the time even in darkness 
and run without sound. The time here is expressed in Roman

numerals, pierced so that light from a hidden oil lamp could pass 
through them; a drum was used to quash the ticktocking sound of 
a pendulum. 

The clock was encased in an elaborate architectural structure 
with paired columns and scrolled feet that resembles a tabernacle. 
It shows the influence of both Bernini and Borromini. The 
painting at its center, by Francesco Trevisani (1656-1746), is the 
Flight into Egypt. This theme is a pun on time—as time also 
flies. Trevisani was a well-known Roman painter, and this was 
no small commission. Indeed, we know that Gaulli, the painter of 
the ceiling of II Gesu (see fig. 19.12), also executed paintings for 
such clocks. 


A Baroque Alternative: Francesco Borromini 

Berninis greatest rival in architecture, Francesco Borromini 
(1599-1667), was a secretive and emotionally unstable artist who 
committed suicide. The contrast in temperament between these 
two architects would be evident from their works alone, even if 
we did not have the accounts written by their contemporaries. 
Berninis church designs are dramatically simple and unified, 
while Borrominis structures are extravagantly complex. But 
where the surfaces of Berninis interiors are extremely rich, 
Borromini s are surprisingly plain: They rely on the architect s 
phenomenal grasp of spatial geometry to achieve their spiritual 
effects. Bernini himself agreed with those who denounced 
Borromini for flagrantly disregarding the classical tradition, 
enshrined in Renaissance theory and practice, that architecture 
must reflect the proportions of the human body. Certainly, 
Bernini, even at the height of the Baroque, was more tied to a clas¬ 
sical vocabulary. But perhaps his criticisms of Borromini were 
only an expression of all-too-human rivalries. 

SAN CARLO ALLE QUATTRO FONTANE Borrominis first 
major project was the church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane 
(fig. 19.17), a small structure on a difficult-to-fit corner. It is the 
syntax, not the vocabulary, that is new and disquieting here. The 
ceaseless play of concave and convex surfaces makes the entire 
structure seem elastic, as if pulled out of shape by pressures that 
no previous building could have withstood. The plan (fig. 19.18) 
is a pinched oval that suggests a distended and half-melted Greek 
cross, yet it is a basically central-planned church. The inside of the 
coffered dome (fig. 19.19), like the plan, looks “stretched”: If the 
tension were relaxed, it would snap back to normal. Light coming 
from the windows, partially hidden at the base of the dome, and 
a honeycomb of fanciful coffers of decreasing size to create the 
illusion of greater height make the dome appear weightless. The 
symbol of the Trinity appears in the vault of the lantern in this 
church, built for the Trinitarians, an order dedicated to the 
mysteries of the Holy Trinity. 

On the facade (see fig. 19.17), designed almost 30 years 
later, the pressures and counterpressures reach their maximum 
intensity. Borromini merges architecture and sculpture in a way 
that must have shocked Bernini. No such union had been

attempted since Gothic art. A study of the two entablatures of 
fluid concave and convex turns over the bays in a mix and match 
fashion provides an insight into his design methods. The statues 
above the entrance emerge like actors entering a stage from 
behind a thin screen. The sculptures, interestingly enough, are 
by Bernini s assistant Antonio Raggi, who also worked on the 
ceiling of II Gesu (see fig. 19.12). San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane 
established Borromini s fame. “Nothing similar,” wrote the head 
of the religious order for which the church was built, “can be 
found anywhere in the world. This is attested by the foreigners 
who...try to procure copies of the plan. We have been asked 
for them by Germans, Flemings, Frenchmen, Italians, Spaniards, 
and even Indians. ” Yet the design was also described by a contem¬ 
porary, no doubt because of its seeming disregard of regular 
geometry, as “the corruption of architecture. ” 


SANT’IVO Borrominis church of Sant’Ivo alia Sapienza (figs. 
19.20 and 19.21) was built at the end of an existing cloister for a 
university, which soon became the University of Rome. It is more 
compact than San Carlo, but equally daring. Sant’Ivo is a small, 
central-plan church based on a hexagonal star. The six-pointed 
plan represents Sapienza (wisdom), although as the church was 
first built under Pope Urban VIII (Barberini) it was suggested by 
contemporaries that the plan represented the Barberini bee, also 
seen in Berninis Baldacchino and Cortonas ceiling (see figs. 19.15 
and 19.11). In designing this unique church, Borromini may have 
been thinking of octagonal structures, such as San Vitale in

Ravenna (fig. 8.21), but the result is completely novel. Inside (fig. 
19.22), it offers a single, unified, organic experience, as the walls 
extend the ground plan into the vault, culminating in Borromini s 
unique spiral lantern. The hexagonal star pattern is continued up 
to the circular base of the lantern. The stars on the wall refer to 
the Chigi family of Pope Alexander VII, who was in power when 
the building was completed. 

SANT’ACNESE A third project by Borromini, the church of 
Sant’Agnese, is set on the Piazza Navona (fig. 19.23), a grand 
ancient stadium space in which three sculptural Baroque fountains 
celebrate the new age. The central monument, topped by an 
Egyptian obelisk, is the Four Rivers Fountain by Bernini, and 
its location in front of Sant’Agnese demonstrates the rivalry 
between Borromini and Bernini: The latter fought for the church 
commission, but lost. 


Sant’Agnese is of special interest as a critique of St. Peter s 
and each of its architects. There were two problems that Maderno 
had been unable to solve at St. Peters. Although his facade 
forms an impressive unit with Michelangelo s dome when seen 
from a distance, the dome is gradually hidden by the new facade 
as we approach the church. It appears to “sink.” Furthermore, 
the towers he planned for each end posed formidable structural 
difficulties. After Berninis first attempt to overcome these 
problems failed, he proposed making the towers free-standing, 
but he was forced to abandon the plan when it was severely 
criticized. The facade of Sant’Agnese offers a brilliant solution 
to both of these difficulties. Borromini took over the project, 
which had been begun by another architect, Carlo Rainaldi 
(1611-1691), the year before, and completely recast it without, 
however, entirely abandoning the Greek-cross plan. The 
design is essentially a central-plan (fig. 19.24), and the dome is

not set back at all. The facade s lower part is adapted from the 
facade of St. Peter s, but it curves inward, so that the dome (a tall, 
slender version of Michelangelo s) functions as the upper part of 
the facade. As the dome is nearly at the entranceway, the problem 
of its apparent “sinking” is solved. The dramatic juxtaposition of 
concave and convex, so characteristic of Borromini, is emphasized 
by the two towers, which form a monumental group with the 
dome. Once again, Borromini joins Gothic and Renaissance 
features—the two-tower facade and the dome—into a remarkably 
elastic compound to tower over the ancient site. 


fig. 19.17), using a highly individualized vocabulary. Incredibly, 
the exterior of the building, in the local tradition, is made almost 
entirely of brick, but was probably meant to be stuccoed in imi¬ 
tation marble. 

Even more extraordinary is Guarini s dome for the Chapel of 
the Holy Shroud, a round structure attached to Turin cathedral 
(fig. 19.27). The dome and the tall drum, with its alternating win¬ 
dows and niches, consists of familiar Borrominian motifs. Yet it 
ushers us into a realm of pure illusion completely unlike anything 
by the earlier architect. Here, the surface has disappeared in a 


The Baroque in Turin: Guarino Guarini 

The new ideas introduced by Borromini were developed further 
not in Rome but in Turin, the capital of Piedmont, which became 
the creative center of Baroque architecture in Italy toward the end 
of the seventeenth century In 1666, Guarino Guarini (1624- 
1683), Borromini s most brilliant successor, was called to Turin to 
work as an engineer and mathematician by Duke Carlo Emanuele 
II. Guarini was a Theatine priest whose genius was grounded in 
philosophy and mathematics. His design for the facade of the 
Palazzo Carignano (figs. 19.25 and 19.26) repeats on a larger scale 
the undulating movement of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (see 



1 9.25 Plan of Palazzo Carignano

maze of ribs that is both unusual and exotic, created through the 
manipulation of repeated geometric forms. As a result, we find 
ourselves staring into a huge kaleidoscope. Above this seemingly 
infinite funnel of space hovers the dove of the Holy Spirit within 
a 12-point star inside the chapel, which holds one of the most 
precious relics of Christendom, the Shroud of Christ. 

Guarini s dome retains the symbolic meaning of the dome of 
Heaven, and repeats architecturally what Correggio achieved in 
painting in his Assumption of the Virgin (see fig. 17.27). A concen¬ 
tric structure of alternating rings of light and shadow enhances the 
illusion of great depth and features brilliant light at its center; it 
also recalls the Passion of Christ. The objective harmony of the 
Renaissance has here become subjective, a compelling experience 
of the infinite, close to the Gothic mysticism of Abbot Suger s 
infinite (see page 391). If Borrominis style at times suggests a 
fusion of Gothic and Renaissance, Guarini takes the next step. In 
his writings, he contrasts the “muscular” architecture of the 
ancients with the effect of Gothic churches, which appear to stand 
only by means of some kind of miracle, and he expresses equal 
admiration for both. This attitude corresponds exactly to his own 
practice. Guarini and Borromini were obsessed with originality 
and were willing to break architectural rules to achieve it. By 
using the most advanced mathematical techniques of his day, 
Guarini accomplished wonders even greater than the seeming 
weightlessness of Gothic structures. The dome itself, for example, 
is on three pendentives instead of the usual four—a completely 
fresh approach to a traditional form.

The Baroque in Venice: 

Baldassare Longhena 

The Republic of Venice commissioned a church at the head of the 
Grand Canal to show its gratitude to the Virgin for ending the 
plague of 1630—Santa Maria della Salute (fig. 19.28; salute means 
“good health”). It was designed by Baldassare Longhena 
(1598-1682) in 1631 and as such may well be the first Baroque 
church, but it was not consecrated until 1687, after Longhena s 
death. It took the heart of the century to complete and rivals the 
masterpieces of Rome. The Salute s commission required that it 
be in “harmony with the site”; the structure dominates the Grand 
Canal and has become a focal point on the Venice skyline— 
unique, graceful, classical, yet ornate. 

The most important aspect of the building is that its plan is 
that of a regular octagon whose distinctive form can be seen on its 
multiple facades, with a dome rising from its center. It is in the

shape of a crown, referring to its dedication to the Virgin, Queen 
of Heaven. Each face is a double-columned triumphal arch whose 
columns stand on high pedestals. The entablature is joined to the 
drum in a series of large sculptural volutes that are both elegant 
and distinctive. The details—drum, double columns, and octago¬ 
nal shape—all have their sources in the early Church, and in 
works by Bramante and Palladio, but they became the hallmark of 
the Baroque in Venice. 

SCULPTURE IN ITALY 

Baroque sculpture, like Baroque painting, was vital, energized, 
and dynamic, suggesting action and deep emotion. The subject 
matter was intended to evoke an emotional response in the viewer. 
Sculpture was usually life-size, but with a sense of grandeur that 
suggested larger-than-life figures; and many figures were indeed 
monumental. Deeply cut, the facial expressions and clothing caught 
the light and cast shadows to create not just depth but drama. 

Early Baroque Sculpture: 

Stefano Maderno 

Baroque sculpture began with the delicate naturalism of the Santa 
Cecilia (fig. 19.29) by Stefano Maderno (ca. 1576-1636). Rather 
than showing his subject standing as in life, as with almost all 
depictions of saints, Maderno depicted her as a recumbent dead 
body. This fifth-century saint s body had been found, uncor¬ 
rupted, just a year before, in 1599, in the church of Santa Cecilia 
in Trastevere. The recovery of her body prompted numerous 
depictions during the Baroque period of Santa Cecilia, the patron 
saint of music, but always showing her young, alive, engaged, and 
often playing a musical instrument. Here, however, she lies on her 
right side, on a slab of marble, her dress pulled between her knees 
and down to her toes as if lying on a bed rather than a morgue 
slab. The cut in her neck and the twisting away of her head indi¬ 
cate that she is dead. (Indeed, she was martyred by decapitation, 
but her head did not actually separate from her body.) She lies 
vulnerable even in her death, evoking pathos. The poignancy of 
Maderno s depiction of his subject is one of the characteristics of 
the Baroque. 

The Evolution of the Baroque: 

Gianlorenzo Bernini 

Bernini was a sculptor as well as an architect, and sculpture and 
architecture are never far apart in his work as we have seen in 
the Baldacchino (see fig. 19.15). He was trained by his father, 
Pietro Bernini (1562-1629), a sculptor who worked in Florence, 
Naples, and Rome, but who was also influenced by Giovanni 
Bologna (see fig. 17.13). Berninis style was thus a direct out¬ 
growth of Mannerist sculpture in many ways, but this debt alone 
does not explain its revolutionary qualities, which emerged early 
in his career.

DAVID As in the colonnade for St. Peter s (see fig. 19.14), we can 
often see a strong relationship between Bernini s sculpture and 
examples from antiquity. If we compare Berninis David (fig. 
19.30) with Michelangelo s (see fig. 16.13) and ask which is closer 
to the Pergamon frieze or the Laocoon (see fig. 5.73 and page 183), 
our vote must go to Bernini, whose sculpture shares with 
Hellenistic works that union of body and spirit, of motion and 
emotion, which Michelangelo so consciously tempers. This does 
not mean that Michelangelo is more classical than Bernini. It 
shows, rather, that the Baroque and the High Renaissance drew 
different lessons from ancient art. 

Bernini s David has the fierceness of expression, movement, 
and dynamism of the Laocoon. In part, what makes it Baroque in 
character is the implied presence of Goliath. Unlike earlier statues 
of David, including Donatello s (see fig. 15.33), Berninis is con¬ 
ceived not as a self-contained figure but as half of a pair, with his 
entire being focused on his (invisible) adversary Bernini s David 
tells us clearly enough where he sees the enemy. Consequently, 
the space between David and his invisible opponent is charged 
with energy—it “belongs” to the statue. The intensity of his 
expression suggests his focused determination. It has come down 
to us that the David's face is modeled on Bernini s own; he made 
this self-portrait by looking in a mirror held by his patron, 
Cardinal Barberini, who would become Pope Urban VIII. (See 
Materials and Techniques , page 688.) 

Berninis David shows us a distinctive feature of Baroque 
sculpture: its new, active relationship with the surrounding space. 
But it is meant to be seen, as is most other Baroque sculpture, 
from one primary point of view. Bernini presents us with “the 
moment” of action, not just the contemplation of the killing—as 
in Michelangelo s work—or the aftermath of it—as in Donatello s. 
Baroque sculpture often suggests a heightened vitality and energy 
Because they so often present an “invisible complement” (like the

Goliath of Bernini s David), Baroque statues attempt pictorial 
effects that were traditionally outside the realm of monumental 
sculpture. Such a charging of space with energy is, in fact, a key 
feature of Baroque art. Caravaggio had achieved it in his The 
Calling of St. Matthew with the aid of a sharply focused beam 
of light (see fig. 19.2). And as we have seen in Gaulli s ceiling for 
II Gesu (see fig. 19.12), both painting and sculpture may be com¬ 
bined with architecture to form a compound dramatic illusion— 
one that Bernini would explore in other works. 

THE CORNARO CHAPEL! THE ECSTASY OF ST- TERESA 

Bernini had a passionate interest in the theater and was an inno¬ 
vative scene designer. A contemporary wrote that he “gave a pub¬ 
lic opera wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues, invented 
the engines, composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the 
theatre. ” Thus he was at his best when he could merge architec¬ 
ture, sculpture, and painting. (See www.myartslab.com. ) His mas¬ 
terpiece in this vein is the Cornaro Chapel in the church of Santa 
Maria della Vittoria, which contains The Ecstasy of St. Teresa (fig. 
19.31 and see page 660). Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), one of the 
great saints of the Counter-Reformation, and director of the 
Reformed Order of the Discalced (“shoeless,” as shown here) 
Carmelites was canonized in 1622. Known for her mystical 
visions, she had described how an angel pierced her heart with a 
flaming golden arrow: “The pain was so great that I screamed 
aloud; but at the same time I felt such infinite sweetness that I 
wished the pain to last forever. It was not physical but psychic 
pain, although it affected the body as well to some degree. It was 
the sweetest caressing of the soul by God.” 

Bernini has made Teresa s visionary experience as sensuously 
real as Correggio s Jupiter and Io (see fig. 17.26); her arm and leg 
are limp and the saint s rapture is obvious. (In a different context 
the angel could be Cupid.) The two figures on their floating 
cloud, which is hollow (so Bernini could hang this group rather 
than fasten it to the wall), are lit from a hidden window above, so 
that they seem almost dematerialized. A viewer thus experiences 
them as a vision. The “invisible complement” here, less specific 
than David's but equally important, is the force that carries the 
figures—they levitate—toward Heaven and causes the turbulence 
of their drapery. Its divine nature is suggested by the golden rays 
(gilt wood) which come from a source high above the altar. In an 
illusionistic fresco by Guidobaldo Abbatini (ca.l 600/05-1656) on 
the vault of the chapel, the glory of Heaven is revealed as a daz¬ 
zling burst of light from which tumble clouds of jubilant angels. 
This celestial explosion gives force to the thrusts of the angel s 
arrow and makes the ecstasy of the saint fully believable. 

To complete the illusion, Bernini even provides a built-in 
audience for his “stage. ” On the sides of the chapel are balconies 
resembling theater boxes that contain marble relief figures depict¬ 
ing members of the Cornaro family, who also witness the vision. 
Their space and ours are the same, and thus they are part of our 
reality, while the saint s ecstasy, which is framed in a niche, occu¬ 
pies a space that is real but beyond our reach, for it is intended as 
a divine realm. 


Finally, the ceiling fresco represents the infinite space of 
Heaven. We may recall that The Burial ofCount Orgaz and its set¬ 
ting also form a whole that includes three levels of reality (see figs. 
18.8 and 18.9). Yet there is a fundamental difference between the 
two chapels. El Greco s Mannerism evokes an ethereal vision in 
which only the stone slab of the sarcophagus is “real,” in contrast 
to Bernini s Baroque staging, where there are several levels of real¬ 
ity and the distinctions between them break down. It would be 
easy to dismiss The Ecstasy of St. Teresa as a theatrical display, but 
Bernini was also a devout Catholic who believed that he was 
inspired directly by God. Like the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius 
of Loyola, which Bernini practiced, his religious sculpture is 
intended to help a viewer identify with miraculous events through 
a vivid appeal to the senses. Theatricality in the service of faith 
was basic to the Counter-Reformation, which often referred to 
the Church as the theater of human life: It took the Baroque to 
bring this ideal to life. 

Bernini was steeped in Renaissance humanism. Central to his 
sculpture is the role of gesture and expression in arousing emo¬ 
tion. While these devices were also important to the Renaissance, 
Bernini uses them with a freedom that seems anti-Classical. 
However, he essentially followed the concept of decorum (which 
also explains why his David is not completely nude), and he 
planned his effects carefully by varying them in accordance with 
his subject. Unlike the Frenchman Nicolas Poussin, whom he 
respected, Bernini did this for the sake of expressive impact rather 
than conceptual clarity. The approaches of the two artists were 
diametrically opposed. For Bernini, antiquity served as no more 
than a point of departure for his own inventiveness, whereas for 
Poussin it was a standard of comparison (see Chapter 21). It is 
nevertheless characteristic of the Baroque that Bernini s theories 
were far more orthodox than his art. Thus, he often sided with the 
classicists against his fellow High Baroque artists, especially 
Pietro da Cortona, who, like Raphael before him, also made an 
important contribution to architecture and was a rival to Bernini 
in that sphere. 

A Classical Alternative: Alessandro Algardi 

It is no less ironic that Cortona was the closest friend of the 
sculptor Alessandro Algardi (1598-1654), who is regarded as 
the leading classical sculptor of the Italian Baroque. His main 
contribution is the great marble relief The Meeting of Pope Leo I 
and Attila (fig. 19.32), done when he took over Berninis role as 
principal sculptor at St. Peter s during the papacy of Innocent X. 
It introduces a new kind of high relief that soon became widely 
popular. Bernini avoided doing reliefs (when such projects were 
required, his studio executed them), but Algardi liked working in 
this more pictorial sculptural form. 

The scene depicts the Huns under Attila being driven away 
after threatening an attack on Rome in 452, a fateful event in 
the early history of Christianity, when its very survival was at 
stake. (The actual event was very different: Leo persuaded the 
Huns not to attack, just as he did with the Vandals three years 


CHAPTER 1 9 THE BAROQUE IN ITALY AND SPAIN 687 



MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Bernini's Sculptural Sketches 

S mall sketches in sculpture—for large-scale works of sculpture or 
architecture—serve as models, practice pieces, or presentation 
pieces for the artist to show a patron. These sculptural models are 
called bozzetti or modelli. Bozzetto (singular) means “sketch,” and 
bozzetti are generally smaller and less finished than modelli, which 
may be closer to the final product, or in some other way “finished” so 
that a patron can see them before the completion of the project. 

Artists may do several drawings as well as several bozzetti for a 
completed piece. And, indeed, Bernini did both drawings in pen and 
ink, in red or black chalk, or even in combinations of chalk and pen in 
preparation for a project, as well as making bozzetti. Bernini’s bozzetti 
and modelli are made in clay (terra cotta), although the completed 
sculptures were executed in marble. This is not just a difference in 
medium, but in technique. Marble sculpture is created through a 
subtractive process—marble is chiseled away. But clay can be worked 
using both additive and subtractive methods, and we know that 
Bernini’s work in clay was primarily additive. 

We can see multiple methods and evidence of a variety of tools used 
by Bernini in his clay bozzetto of the life-size Head of St. Jerome, 
created for a full-length marble sculpture of the saint. Analysis of the 
clay sculpture has shown that this piece, like many others, was made 
from wedged clay—that is, fresh clay that is rolled, smashed, and 
rolled repeatedly to expel air, and then subsequently “worked.” The 
clay is worked on by hand, using fingers (most probably the thumbs, 
index fingers, and middle fingers), with fingernails creating tracks, 
and tools that often have teeth. 

The idea that the clay is worked on by the artist with his own 
hands—his own fingers—is a tantalizing one. Large-scale sculpture 
and complex sculptural and architectural projects may employ several 
assistants chiseling marble. But here in a bozzetto we may be looking 
at the handiwork—the very fingerprints—of the artist. Several of 
Bernini’s bozzetti have been examined for fingerprints in the clay, and 
indeed many have been found. Of the fifteen Bernini bozzetti at the 
Fogg Art Museum (the largest single collection of his bozzetti), 
thirteen have fingerprints. Thirty-four fingerprints in total have been 
found and some of the same prints have been found in works 
executed years apart. Therefore, it is most likely that these prints are 
Bernini’s own. He smoothed surfaces, added clay, created lines and 
edges with his nails, wiped and depressed the clay with his own fingers.

The Head of St. Jerome reveals Bernini’s fingerprints, evidence of nail 
edging, and texturing from tined (fork-like) tools as he added more clay 
to represent the hair and nose. We know that the clay was hollowed out 
from the back, after being scooped out with fingers. As clay would be 
added to the face and hair, chances of cracking and breaking off 
increased. And we see much evidence of cracking in this bozzetto. It is 
apparent that areas were specifically smoothed over to prevent this. 
There is further evidence that a cloth was placed over the Head to keep 
the clay moist for continued work and to prevent further cracking. 

The Head of St. Jerome is enormously expressive, looking tortured, 
with his deep-set eyes and hollow cheeks, but it is the textures in clay 
that make this gaunt face most memorable. 


later. Both protagonists were on horseback, not on foot as seen 
here.) The subject revives a theme that is familiar to us from 
antiquity: the victory over barbarian forces. Now, however, it 
is the Church that triumphs; and the victory is spiritual rather 
than military. 

A sculpture was commissioned since water condensation 
caused by its location in an old doorway of St. Peters (and 
through most of the church) made paintings impossible to 
maintain in pristine condition. Never before had an Italian sculp¬ 
tor attempted such a large relief—it stands nearly 28 feet high 
(nearly twice the height of Ghiberti s bronze doors, see fig. 15.16). 


The problems posed by translating a pictorial conception into a 
relief on this gigantic scale were formidable. If Algardi has not 
succeeded in resolving every detail, his achievement is stupendous 
nonetheless. By varying the depth of the carving, he nearly 
convinces us that the scene takes place in the same space as our 
own. The foreground figures are in such high relief that they 
seem detached from the background. They are modeled almost 
fully in the round. To emphasize the effect, the stage on which 
they are standing projects several feet beyond its surrounding 
niche. Thus, Attila seems to rush out toward us in fear and aston¬ 
ishment as he flees the vision of the two apostles defending the

faith. The result is surprisingly persuasive in both visual and 
expressive terms. 

Such illusionism is quintessentially Baroque. So is the intense 
drama, which is heightened by the twisting poses and theatrical 
gestures of the figures. Algardi was obviously touched by 
Bernini s genius. Strangely enough, the relief is partly a throw¬ 
back to an Assumption of the Virgin of 1606-10 in Santa Maria 
Maggiore by Bernini s father, Pietro. Only in his observance of 
the three traditional levels of relief carving (low, middle, and high, 


instead of continuously variable depth), his preference for frontal 
poses, and his restraint in dealing with the violent action can 
Algardi be called a classicist, and then purely in a relative sense. 
Clearly we must not draw the distinction between the High 
Baroque and Baroque classicism too sharply in sculpture, any 
more so than in painting. 

PAINTING IN SPAIN 

Spain may have been the most powerful political entity at the turn 
of the seventeenth century It ruled the kingdoms of Portugal, 
Sicily, Naples, Milan, the North and South Netherlands, territo¬ 
ries in North America (Florida) and South America (Chile and 
Argentina), the Philippines, the Canary Islands, and parts of 
Africa. This expansion during the sixteenth century brought it to 
the height of its political and economic power. Spain also 
produced great writers and influential saints. Indeed, the newly 
canonized saints of the early seventeenth century (1622)— 
Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order, Francis Xavier, 
an early and influential Jesuit missionary, and Teresa of Avila (see 
fig. 19.31)—were all Spanish. 

Ironically, the Spanish court and most of the aristocracy held 
native artists in low esteem, and so preferred to employ foreign 
painters whenever possible. Thus, the main influences came from 
the Italian kingdoms and the Netherlands. Jan van Eyck visited 
Spain and inspired followers there, Titian worked for Charles V 
of Spain, and El Greco worked in Toledo from the late sixteenth 
into the seventeenth century; we also know that Rubens visited 
Spain at least twice and his work was much admired there. The 
patronage of the court in Madrid and its aggressive collecting, 
mostly by Philip IV, led to a deep appreciation of contemporary 
and Old Master foreign artists. The collection included works 
by Bosch, Raphael, Titian, Annibale, Carracci, Reni, Van Dyck, 
and Rubens. 

Politics, art, and a common bond of loyalty to the Catholic 
Church connected Italy and Spain in the seventeenth century. 
Spain, still in the throes of the Inquisition (a medieval institution 
that was established separately in Spain in 1478 to enforce 
religious orthodoxy and revived in Italy in 1542), was staunchly 
conservative and unflinching; their king was titled “The Most 
Catholic Majesty” Spain restricted membership of the Church to 
only those subjects who professed their unaltering loyalty, and 
imprisoned, executed, or expelled those who did not, while the 
Vatican used its resources to bring Protestant reformers and the 
disaffected back to the Church. The Counter-Reformation, or 
Catholic Reform, began in Rome with a style—Baroque— 
intended to convince viewers of the dynamism and power of the 
Catholic Church, its patrons, and defenders. And, at the beginning 
of the seventeenth century, the largest city on the Italian mainland, 
Naples, was under the rulership of Spain, so the impact of Baroque 
Roman art on Neapolitan and Spanish art was profound. Spanish 
Baroque art was heavily influenced by the style and subject mat¬ 
ter of Caravaggio—directly and via Naples—but had a greater 


CHAPTER 1 9 THE BAROQUE IN ITALY AND SPAIN 689 







starkness. Spanish naturalism may throw a harsher, stronger light 
on its subjects, but it is ultimately at least as sympathetic. 

Spanish Still Life: Juan Sanchez Cot an 

Still-life painting was unknown as a separate form until the 1590s. 
Spanish artists, inspired by the example of Pieter Aertsen (see fig. 
18.31) and other Netherlandish painters, were the first to explore 
this new theme, and Spanish connoisseurs acquired vast collec¬ 
tions of the resulting works. We see the distinctive character that 
Spanish artists brought to this new subject in this example (fig. 
19.33) by Juan Sanchez Cotan (1561-1627). This minor religious 
artist, who became a Carthusian monk, is remembered today as 
one of the first and most remarkable members of the Toledo 
school of still-life painters. Sanchez Cotan s painting has a clear 
order and stark simplicity, qualities that are completely controlled 
by the artist, who hung the vegetables with a fine string at differ¬ 
ent levels to coordinate the design—although whether the thin 
string would hold that full head of cabbage is a tantalizing ques¬ 
tion. Other vegetables sit on a ledge or sill. A window frames the 
still life: This orchestration of subject matter in direct sunlight 
against impenetrable darkness is the hallmark of early Spanish 
still-life painting. The painstaking realism in this stark setting 
creates a memorable image of the humble fruits and vegetables. 

Although he probably used northern Italian paintings as his 
point of departure, Sanchez Cotan s still lifes make one think of 
Caravaggio, whose full impact on Spanish art, however, is not felt 
until considerably later. We do not know exactly how Caravaggism 
was transmitted. The likeliest route was through Naples, where 
Caravaggio had fled to safety and which was under Spanish rule.

Naples and the Impact of Caravaggio: 

Jusepe de Ribera 

Caravaggio s main disciple in Naples was the Spaniard Jusepe de 
Ribera (1591-1652). Ribera settled there after having seen 
Caravaggio s paintings in Rome. Especially popular were Ribera s 
paintings of saints, prophets, and ancient beggar-philosophers. 
Their asceticism appealed strongly to the otherworldliness of 
Spanish Catholicism. Such pictures also reflected the learned 
humanism of the Spanish nobility, who were the artist s main 
patrons. Most of Ribera s figures possess a unique blend of inner 
strength and intensity. 

His The Club-Footed Boy (fig. 19.34) smiles openly and 
endearingly out at us, with a dimpled cheek, although we may be 
somewhat discomforted by his peasant dress, his begging, and his

handicap. The words on the paper he holds state (in translation): 
"Give me alms for the love of God.” This plea for charity alludes 
to the idea in Counter-Reformation theory that only through 
good works may the rich hope to attain salvation. The painting, 
indeed, was made for the viceroy of Naples, a wealthy collector 
who would have seen it as a testament to the importance of 
Christian charity and mercy to the poor. The boy seems almost 
monumental here as he stands against the broad sky with a low 
horizon line, like a musketeer; but instead of a weapon he holds a 
crutch across his shoulder. His deformed foot appears in shadow 
and one doesn’t quite see it at first; but as the leg is lit, Ribera 
clearly directs our attention to it. The deformity may in fact not 
be a club foot but an indication of cerebral palsy. In either case, in 
the seventeenth century, such a deformity would have committed 
one to a life of begging. 

Ribera executed other large paintings of beggars, of the poor, 
and of the blind. These were also the subjects of Pieter Bruegel 
the Elder (see fig. 18.34), who made prints and drawings of 
beggars using various crutches. As with Bruegels works, The 
Club-Footed Boy is made with a moral purpose. The boy himself 
seems an embodiment of joy as he smiles, even laughs. This was 
considered a way for the subject to withstand misfortune, for he 
has the ability to dispense grace: He provides an opportunity for 
others to do good. Ribera’s use of naturalism is a hallmark of 
Spanish and Neapolitan painting and etching, and it extends 
Caravaggio’s impact. Caravaggism was felt especially in Seville, 
the home of the most influential Spanish Baroque painters before 
1640: Diego Velazquez. 

Diego Velazquez: From Seville to Court Painter 

Diego Velazquez (1599-1660) painted in a Caravaggesque vein 
during his early years in Seville. His interests at that time centered 
on scenes of people eating and drinking rather than religious 
themes. Known as bodegones , these grew out of the paintings of 
table-top displays brought to Spain by Flemish artists in the early 
seventeenth century. The Water Carrier of Seville (fig. 19.35), 
which Velazquez painted at age 20 under the apparent influence of 
Ribera, already shows his genius. His powerful grasp of individ¬ 
ual character and dignity gives this everyday scene the solemn 
spirit of a ritual. The scene is related to Giving Drink to the 
Thirsty, one of the Seven Acts of Mercy, a popular theme among 
Caravaggesque painters of the day. Velazquez’s use of focused 
light and the revelation of shapes, textures, surfaces—from the 
glass of water to the sweat of water on the pottery jug—is extraor¬ 
dinary. He must have thought so, too, as he gave this painting to 
his sponsor, a royal chaplain from Seville, no doubt in hopes of 
gaining royal attention. 

In the late 1620s, Velazquez was appointed court painter to 
Philip IV, whose reign from 1621 to 1665 was the great age of 
painting in Spain. Much of the credit for this must go to the duke 
of Olivares, who largely restored Spain’s fortunes and supported 
an ambitious program of artistic patronage to proclaim the 
monarchy’s greatness. Upon moving to Madrid, Velazquez

quickly displaced the Florentines who had enjoyed the favor of 
Philip III and his chief minister, the duke of Lerma. A skilled 
courtier, the artist soon became a favorite of the king, whom he 
served as chamberlain. Velazquez spent most of the rest of his 
life in Madrid painting mainly portraits of the royal family. The 
earlier of these still have the strong division of light and dark and 
the clear outlines of his Seville period, but his work soon acquired 
a new fluency and richness. 

SURRENDER AT BREDA During his visit to the Spanish court 
on a diplomatic mission in 1628, the Flemish painter Peter Paul 
Rubens helped Velazquez discover the beauty of the many Titians 
in the king’s collection. We see this most immediately in 
Velazquez’s Surrender at Breda (fig. 19.36), a dramatic and lush 
painting with color as rich as Titian’s. It, too, would have been in 
the royal collection, intended as part of a series for the king’s Buen 
Retiro Palace. The subject is an interpretation of an event in the 
war between the United Provinces (the Northern Netherlands) 
and Spain which took place in 1625, just a few years before the 


CHAPTER 1 9 THE BAROQUE IN ITALY AND SPAIN 691 




1 9.36 Diego Velazquez, Surrender at Breda. 1634-35. 10 x 12' (3.07 x 3.7 m). Museo del Prado, Madrid 


painting s execution. Although the surrender did indeed occur, it 
certainly did not transpire in this elegant fashion. Here, the Dutch 
general, Justin of Nassau, on the left, bows to give the keys of the 
city to Spanish general, Ambrogio de Spinola, who has just gotten 
off his horse to meet his Dutch counterpart, even to comfort him: 
Note how he places his hand on the shoulder of the vanquished 
officer. Smoke comes from the left over the heads of the Dutch 
soldiers, who seem a bit dazed and forlorn, signaling the defeat of 
Breda. On the right are the Spanish troops who, by positioning 
themselves in front of the raised lances, seem to be standing more 
erect. Additional lances can be seen in the middle distance; one 
expects that the Spanish outnumbered the Dutch. 

In truth, the Netherlands 5 revolt against Spain had ended by 
about 1585, with a truce in 1609, but conflicts (such as the one at 
Breda) continued to flare up. There were no keys to the city, and 


the general probably did not get off his horse. By having the two 
generals confront each other not with hate but with acquiescence, 
Velazquez transforms a military drama into a human one. The 
scene Velazquez painted may in fact be derived from a contempo¬ 
rary play in which Spinola states: “Justin, I accept them [the keys] 
in full awareness of your valor; for the valor of the defeated 
confers fame upon the victor. 55 

THE PORTRAIT OF JUAN DE PAREJA At court, Velazquez 
was famed as a portrait painter. As such, when Philip IV dis¬ 
patched him to Rome in 1648 to purchase paintings and antique 
sculpture, he also gave permission for the artist to paint Pope 
Innocent X. But Velazquez’s reputation seems not to have pre¬ 
ceded him when he arrived in 1649, and he was left waiting for an 
interview with the pope. It was during this interlude that he

painted the portrait of his Sevillian assistant and servant of 
Moorish descent, Juan de Pareja (ca. 1610-1670), who accompa¬ 
nied him to Rome and was an artist himself (fig. 19.37). The 
portrait, stunningly lifelike, was acclaimed when it was exhibited 
at an annual art show in the Pantheon in Rome in March 1650. It 
was said that, of all the paintings, this one was “truth.” Juan de 
Pareja is shown half-length, turned at a three-quarter view, but 
facing us—a triangular format developed by Raphael and Titian 
in the High Renaissance, simplifying the Mona Lisa (fig. 16.7), 
but still using it as their point of departure. As used here, the 
format rivets our attention to his face. The feathery lace collar, 
brilliantly painted, picks up the white highlights of the subject’s 
face, creating a formidably sculptural visage. A white patch, a tear 
in his clothing at the elbow, reminds a viewer of his class, a device 
Velazquez had used earlier in The Water Carrier of Seville. The 
success of this portrait and Velazquez’s sudden fame in Rome may 
have prompted the pope to sit for him, which he did, soon after. 

THE MAIDS OF HONOR Velazquez’s mature style is seen at 
its fullest in The Maids of Honor (fig. 19.38). Both a group portrait 


and a genre scene, it might be subtitled “the artist in his studio,” 
for Velazquez depicts himself at work on a huge canvas. In the 
center is Princess Margarita, who has just posed for him, among 
her playmates and maids of honor. The faces of her parents, King 
Philip IV and Queen Maria Anna, appear in the mirror on the 
back wall. Their position also suggests a slightly different vantage 
point than ours, and indeed there are several viewpoints through¬ 
out the picture. In this way, the artist perhaps intended to include 
a viewer in the scene by implication, even though it was clearly 
painted for the king and hung in his summer quarters at the 
Alcazar Palace. Antonio Palomino, the first to discuss The Maids 
of Honor, wrote: “the name of Velazquez will live from century to 
century, as long as that of the most excellent and beautiful 
Margarita, in whose shadow his image is immortalized.” Thanks 
to Palomino (see Primary Source , page 695), we know the identity 
of every person in the painting. Through the presence of the 
princess, king, and queen, the canvas commemorates Velazquez’s 
position as royal painter and his aspiration to the Order of 
Santiago—a papal military order to which he gained admission 
only with great difficulty three years after the painting was

Velazquez had struggled to establish his status at court. Even 
though the usual family investigations (almost 150 friends and 
relatives were interviewed) assisted his claim to nobility, the very 
nature of his profession worked against him. “Working with his 
hands” conveyed on Velazquez the very antithesis of noble status. 
Only by special papal dispensation was he eventually accepted into 


the Order of Santiago. The Maids of Honor, then, is an expression 
of personal ambition; it is a claim for both the nobility of the act 
of painting and that of the artist himself. The presence of the king 
and queen affirm his status. The Spanish court had already hon¬ 
ored Titian and Rubens (although not in the same way); as these 
artists were both held in high regard, they served as models for 
Velazquez and continued to have a significant impact on him. The 
painting reveals Velazquez’s fascination with light as fundamental

Antonio Palomino (1655-1726) 

From El Museo Pictorica y Escala Optica: 

On Velazquez 

In 1724 , Palomino wrote a biography of Spanish artists with a special 
focus on Velazquez , whom he revered above others. The following is a 
description ofVelazquez’s The Maids of Honor, identifying the figures 
and recording comments on its reception. 

A mong the marvelous pictures done by Velazquez was a large 
canvas with the portrait of the Empress (then the Infanta of 
Spain), Margarita Marfa of Austria, as a young child. ... Kneeling at 
her feet is Marfa Agustina, maid of honor of the Queen, giving her 
water in a small vessel. On the other side is Isabel de Velasco, also a 
maid of honor, who seems to be speaking. In the foreground is a dog 
lying down and next to it Nicolas Pertusato, a dwarf, who is stepping 
on it to show that it is a gentle animal in spite of its ferocious appear¬ 
ance. These two figures are in shadow and impart great harmony to 
the composition. Behind is Mari-Barbola, a formidable-looking 
dwarf, and slightly farther back and in darker colors are Marcela de 
Ulloa, attendant to the ladies-in-waiting, and a bodyguard. On the 
other side is Diego Velazquez painting; he holds the palette in his left 
hand and a brush in his right. Around his waist he wears the key to 
the King’s Chamber and on his breast, the Cross of the Order of 
Santiago that was added at His Majesty’s orders after Velazquez died, 


because Velazquez was not a member of this Order when the picture 
was painted. ... 

The canvas on which he is painting is large, and nothing of what he 
paints can be seen because only the back part is visible. 

Velazquez proved his great genius because of the clever way in 
which he reveals the subject of what he is painting. He makes use of 
the mirror at the rear of the gallery to show us the reflection of our 
Catholic kings, Philip and Mariana. In this gallery, which is called the 
Room of the Prince, where he used to paint, several pictures can be 
seen indistinctly on the walls. These are known to be by Rubens and 
represent stories from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. This gallery has several 
windows that are shown in perspective to make the room seem large. 
The light comes from the [picture’s] left but enters only through the 
front and rear windows. ... To the left of the mirror is an open door 
where stands Joseph Nieto, the Queen’s Marshal. He can be clearly 
seen in spite of the distance and poor light. Between the figures there 
is atmosphere. The figure painting is superior, the conception new, 
and in short it is impossible to overrate this painting because it is 
truth, not painting. Velazquez finished it in 1656. ... 

The painting was highly esteemed by His Majesty and he fre¬ 
quently went to look at it. It was placed in the King’s lower suite, in 
the office, along with other excellent works. In our own day, Luca 
Giordano was asked by Charles the Second what he thought of it and 
he answered, “Sir, this is the theology of Painting. ”

to vision. The artist challenges us to match the mirror image 
against the paintings on the same wall, and against the “picture” 
of the man in the open doorway. Although the side lighting and 
strong contrasts of light and dark still suggest the influence of 
Caravaggio, Velazquez’s technique is far subtler. The glowing col¬ 
ors have a Venetian richness, but the brushwork is even freer and 
sketchier than Titian’s. Velazquez explored the optical qualities of 
light more fully than any other painter of his time. His aim is to 
represent the movement of light itself and the infinite range of its 
effects on form and color. For Velazquez, as for Jan Vermeer in 
Delft (see pages 732-33), light creates the visible world. 

Monastic Orders and Zurbaran 

Francisco de Zurbaran (1598-1664) began his professional life as 
a painter, as did Velazquez, in Seville, and he stands out among his 
contemporaries for his quiet intensity. His most important works, 
done for monastic orders, are filled with an ascetic piety that is 
uniquely Spanish. St. Serapion (fig. 19.39) shows an early member 
of the Mercedarians (Order of Mercy) who was brutally mur¬ 
dered by pirates in 1240 but canonized only 100 years after this

picture was painted. The canvas was placed as a devotional image 
in the funerary chapel of the order, which was originally dedi¬ 
cated to self-sacrifice. 

Zurbaran s painting reminds us of Caravaggio. Shown as a life- 
size, three-quarter-length figure, St. Serapion fills the picture 
plane: He is both a hero and a martyr. The contrast between the 
white habit and the dark background gives the figure a heightened 
visual and expressive presence, so that a viewer contemplates the 
slain monk with a mixture of compassion and awe. Here, pictorial 
purity and spiritual purity become one, and the stillness creates a 
reverential mood that complements the stark realism of the image. 
As a result, we identify with the strength of St. Serapion s faith 
rather than with his physical suffering. The absence of rhetorical 
pathos is what makes this image deeply moving. 

Culmination in Devotion: 

Bartolome Esteban Murillo 

The work of Bartolome Esteban Murillo (1617-1682), Zurbaran s 
(and, before him, Velazquez’s) successor as the leading painter in 
Seville, is the most cosmopolitan, as well as the most accessible, of 
any of the Spanish Baroque artists. For that reason, he had count¬ 
less followers, whose pale imitations obscure his real achieve¬ 
ment. His many religious images, especially his depictions of the 
Virgin (fig. 19.40), typified Spanish arts desire to promote the 
Virgin in the visual vocabulary of the seventeenth century, and 
they were much copied. The insistence on Virgin imagery defied 
the Protestant influence in much of Europe. The Immaculate 
Conception was controversial even among Catholics; the doc¬ 
trine, promoted by Franciscans (Murillo was a lay member), says 
that the Virgin was conceived without Original Sin. Its detractors, 
led by the Dominicans, thought that she had been cleansed of sin 
in the womb after conception, but before birth. Paintings on this 
theme were used as propaganda to promote the Virgin s status so 
that the concept would, through art, become church dogma 
(accepted as true on the basis of faith); it was finally decreed as 
dogma in 1854. However, already in the seventeenth century there 
were spectacles of the “Immaculata” (processions carrying the 
image of the Immaculate Virgin) in Seville and papal declarations 
(notably by Alexander VII in 1661) that urged this change. 
Murillo was one of the major painters of this theme. 

The haunting expressiveness of the Virgin s face and of the 
cherubs or angels has a gentle pathos that is more emotionally 
appealing than Zurbaran s austerity. This human warmth reflects 
a basic change in religious outlook. The Virgin s piety is shown 


by her hands folded in prayer and upward glance to Heaven; 
she stands on a crescent moon, an attribute of the Immaculate 
Conception (“And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven: a 
woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet”— 
Revelation 12:1). The extraordinary sophistication of Murillos 
brushwork and the subtlety of his color show the influence of 
Velazquez. Murillo succeeded so well that the vast majority of 
religious paintings in Spain and its South American colonies for 
the next 150 years were derived from his work. Although genre 
and still-life painting were also popular, the promotion of the 
Virgin in Spanish art defined Spain s Catholic and conservative art 
and its role in defying the Reformation of northern Europe.

The Baroque in 
the Netherlands 


i\j 

o 


T he seventeenth century brought a division of the 

Netherlands into two parts: the Northern Netherlands (the present-day 
Netherlands) and the Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium and 
part of France). Each is often known by the name of its most important 
province: Holland (North) and Flanders (South). The Catholic Spanish Habsburgs 


had ruled the Netherlands in the sixteenth century, but Philip II s 
repressive measures against the Protestants and his attempts to 
curtail their autonomy led to a rebellion that lasted 15 years. In 
1581, the northern provinces of the Netherlands, led by William 
the Silent of Nassau of the House of Orange, declared their 
independence from Spain. Spain soon recovered the Southern 
Netherlands in 1585, and Catholicism remained the official 
religion. After a long struggle, the seven major provinces of the 
North, whose inhabitants were predominantly of the Reformed 
Church, became the United Provinces and gained their autonomy, 
which was recognized by the truce declared in 1609. Although 
hostilities broke out once more in 1621, the freedom of the 
Dutch (i.e., the people of the North) was never again seriously in 
doubt. Their independence was finally ratified by the Treaty of 
Munster, which ended the Thirty Years’ War in 1648. The Dutch 
Republic was formally recognized by the rest of Europe as an 
independent state. 

The division of the Netherlands had very different conse¬ 
quences for the respective economies, social structures, cultures, 
and religions of the North and the South. At the same time, 
throughout the seventeenth century, people crossed back and 
forth between the two regions, so providing some social and

cultural fluidity. After being sacked by Spanish troops in 1576, 
Antwerp, the leading port of the Southern Netherlands, lost 
half its population: Many migrated to the Northern Netherlands. 
The city gradually regained its position as Flanders’s commercial 
and artistic capital, although Brussels was the seat of government. 
As part of the Treaty of Munster, however, the Scheldt River 
leading to Antwerp’s harbor was closed to shipping, thus 
crippling trade for the next two centuries. Because Flanders 
continued to be ruled by Spanish regents, the Habsburgs, who 
viewed themselves as the defenders of the “true” (i.e., Catholic) 
faith, its artists relied primarily on commissions from Church and 
State, but the aristocracy and wealthy merchants were also 
important patrons. 

Holland, in contrast, was proud of its hard-won freedom. 
Although the predominant religion was the Reformed Church, 
the Dutch were notable for their religious tolerance. Even 
Catholicism continued to flourish there, and included many 
artists among its ranks, while Jews found a haven from persecu¬ 
tion. While the cultural links with Flanders remained strong, 
several factors encouraged the quick development of specifically 
Dutch artistic traditions. Unlike Flanders, where most artistic 
activity radiated from Antwerp, Holland had a number of local 
schools of painting. Besides Amsterdam, the commercial capital, 
there were important artists in Haarlem, Utrecht, Feiden, Delft, 
and other towns who established local styles. Thus, Holland 
produced an almost bewildering variety of masters and styles. 


CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 


699 


CHAPTER 



The new nation was one of merchants, farmers, and seafarers, 
who may formerly have earned their living from local commerce 
such as the fishing trade, but who now had the opportunity to 
have more distant adventures with the development of the famous 
Dutch East India Company (known as the VOC from its Dutch 
initials), established in 1602, and its counterpart, established in 
1621, the Dutch West India Company These companies devel¬ 
oped trade in East Asia (China, Japan, and Indonesia) and in the 
Americas, bringing home exotic wares (map 20.1, page 702), 
strange creatures, and fabulous flora and fauna, as well as engag¬ 
ing in exploration, map making, and the creation of colonial 
settlements. These adventures rippled though the economy: The 
sailors experienced them directly, but they also had a major 
impact on the directors and governors of the companies, who 
made their fortunes from these ventures. Even the townspeople 
who stayed home were able to purchase or at least see some of the 
wonders brought back from faraway places. From this time for¬ 
ward, the Dutch could never again be thought provincial; even 
those who did not travel could be considered, and would consider 
themselves, worldly. 


As the Reformed Church was iconoclastic, Dutch artists 
rarely received the large-scale altarpiece commissions that were 
available throughout the Catholic world. While the House of 
Orange in The Hague and city governments and civic bodies such 
as militias provided a certain amount of artistic patronage, their 
demands were limited. As a result, private collectors became the 
painters’ chief source of support. This was true before 1600, but 
the full effect of such patronage can be seen only after that date. 
There was no shrinkage of output. On the contrary, the public 
developed such an appetite for pictures that the whole country 
became gripped by a kind of collector’s mania. During a visit to 
Holland in 1641, the English traveler John Evelyn noted in his 
diary that “tis an ordinary thing to find, a common Farmor lay 
out two, or 3000 pounds in this Commodity, their houses are full 
of them, and they vend them at their kermas’es [fairs] to very 
greate gaines.” Although it was unlikely farmers’ houses were 
filled with paintings, or that Evelyn even visited them, there is no 
doubt paintings were not made only for the Church and the 
court. In the Northern Netherlands (as well as the Southern 
Netherlands), a new class of patron arose—the wealthy merchant.

FLANDERS 

Art in seventeenth-century Flanders was defined by the art of 
Peter Paul Rubens. Rubens brought Flanders, really Antwerp, to 
international notice and the art of the Western world to Flanders. 
He did this through his own travels (bringing ideas back to 
Antwerp), his commissions, and his own extensive workshop. 

Baroque art in Flanders was based on commissions. Its many 
churches could now, with the Truce of 1609 and hope of a sus¬ 
tained peace, be rebuilt and redecorated. The Habsburg archduke 
and archduchess, their family, and private patrons provided these 
commissions. Rubens’s own interests were largely within the 
realm of painting, but his role in sculpture and sculptural decora¬ 
tion, architecture, costumes, and illustrated books (published by 
the famous Plantin Press in Antwerp) was still significant. All 
these art forms were directly affected by Rubens and his art. 

The subjects of Flemish art, and of Rubens’s paintings, were 
primarily religious—they were frequently large altarpieces with 
life-size figures, but portraits also accounted for many works. 
Although Rubens also executed landscapes, other artists, includ¬ 
ing Frans Snyders, Clara Peeters, Jan Davidsz. de Heem, and Jan 
Brueghel the Elder, frequently painted still lifes or “game pieces,” 
sometimes in collaboration with Rubens. Rubens’s one-time 
assistant Anthony van Dyck excelled in portraits and religious and 
mythological paintings, as did Jacob Jordaens, who also painted 
genre scenes. But all artistic efforts were influenced by Rubens. 

Peter Paul Rubens and Defining the Baroque 

Although the Baroque style was born in Rome, it soon became 
international. The great Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens 
(1577-1640) played a role of unique importance in this process. 
He epitomized the Baroque ideal of the virtuoso artist, acting as 
diplomat and advisor, with an entree to the courts of Europe. He 
was widely read and widely traveled, with a knowledge of classi¬ 
cal literature and several languages. He was acclaimed for his 
intellect, and for a vitality that enabled him to unite the natural 
and supernatural and to attain a Baroque theatricality and drama 
that we have also seen in Bernini (see Chapter 19). He finished 
what Durer had started 100 years earlier and Jan Gossaert had 
continued (see Chapter 18): the breakdown of the artistic barriers 
between Northern and Southern Europe. Rubens’s father was a 
prominent Antwerp Protestant who had fled to Germany to 
escape Spanish persecution during the war of independence. The 
family had returned to Antwerp after his death, when Peter Paul 
was ten years old, and the boy had grown up a devout Catholic. 
Trained by local painters, Rubens became a master in Antwerp’s 
Guild of St. Luke in 1598, but he only really developed a personal 
style when he went to Italy two years later. 

During his eight years in Italy, in the art and patronage centers 
of Mantua, Genoa, Florence, and Rome, he absorbed the Italian 
tradition far more completely than had any northern European 
before him. He eagerly studied ancient sculpture, the master¬ 
pieces of the High Renaissance, and the work of Caravaggio and 


Annibale Carracci. In fact, Rubens competed on even terms with 
the best Italians of his day and could well have made his career in 
Italy: He received major commissions there for both portraits 
and altarpieces. 

RUBENS AND THE ALTARPIECE The Raising of the Cross 
(fig. 20.1 and see page 698) was painted for the high altar of the 
church of St. Walburga (now destroyed). It was the first major 
altarpiece Rubens painted after his return to Antwerp in 1609. Its 
very subject (the raising) speaks to the dynamism of the Baroque 
and it shows how much he was indebted to his Italian experience. 
The muscular figures, modeled to show their physical power and 
passionate feeling, recall the antique Hellenistic sculpture that 
Rubens saw, drew, and collected (see Primary Source , page 704), 
and the figures from the Sistine Chapel ceiling that he also copied 
(fig. 20.2). These works of art served as models for his heroic 
figures throughout his life. He also gathered inspiration from 
the Farnese Gallery, while the lighting suggests Caravaggio’s 
work (see figs. 19.1-19.4 and 19.7). The composition of the altar- 
piece recalls that of Rosso’s The Descent from the Cross (see fig.

17.1), yet the painting is more heroic in scale and conception. Its 
rich color and luminosity, especially in the sky and background 
of the right wing, is ultimately indebted to the influence of Titian 
(see fig. 16.31). Thus, the altarpiece owes much of its success to 
Rubenss ability to combine Italian influences with Netherlandish 
ideas, thereby creating something entirely new. Rubens is also a 
Flemish realist in such details as the foliage, the armor of the soldier, 
and the curly-haired dog in the foreground. These varied elements 
are integrated into a composition of tremendous force. The unsta¬ 
ble pyramid of bodies, swaying precariously under the strain of 
the dramatic action, bursts the limits of the frame in a typically 
Baroque way, making a viewer feel like a participant in the action. 

Christ is shown parallel to the plane, so that we fully see him 
being raised to the crucifixion. The “raising” implies movement 
and action that is happening at that moment. Rubens extended 
the figure groups into both wings with an implied continuous 
landscape background. On the left are the Virgin and St. John, 
with horrified women; on the right are Roman soldiers; on the 
back of the wings (not shown here) are saints. 

The altarpiece would have been 35 feet high in its final form— 
the main triptych was beneath a now-lost painting of God the 
Father, which explains Christ’s heavenward imploring glance. He 
was surrounded by angels and a sculpted pelican (a symbol of 


Gods sacrifice) topped the work. The painting was placed on the 
high altar at the top of 19 steps, so the entire altarpiece ensemble 
—dramatic, powerful, and monumental—would have towered 
above all else. 

Rubens’s epic canvases define the scope and style of High 
Baroque painting. They possess a seemingly boundless energy 
and inventiveness, which, like his heroic nudes, express life at its 
fullest. And his portraits were equally inventive and dramatic. 

RUBENS AS PORTRAITIST Rubens was one of the greatest 
and most influential portraitists of the seventeenth century, 
recording the vast wealth and stature of his often noble patrons. 
He painted several portraits while in Italy and maintained contacts 
with his Genoese patrons for years after he left. His resplendent 
portrait of Marchesa Brigida Spinola Doria (fig. 20.3), a member 
of the ruling class of Genoese banking families, who invested in 
trade with Africa and the East, was painted in 1606, probably in 
celebration of her wedding at age 22. 

Although still a large painting, it was even more monumental 
in the seventeenth century—perhaps 9 feet high—before being 
cut down on all four sides. A nineteenth-century lithograph of 
the painting shows that the Marchesa was originally full-length, 
and was shown striding from the terrace of her palazzo. She is

Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) 



From a Letter to Sir Dudley Carleton 

In 1618, Rubens began a correspondence with Sir Dudley Carleton 
(1573-1632), the English ambassador to The Hague, in order to arrange 
an exchange of the Englishman’s antique sculptures for his own paint¬ 
ings. Well-traveled and with diplomatic appointments to Paris and 
Venice (he was later made secretary of state), Carleton had acquired a 
notable collection of antique sculpture during his time in Italy 
(1610-15). Rubens, too, had a collection that he began to amass during 
his own stay in Italy (1600-1608). In his first letter, Rubens proposed an 
exchange for “pictures by my hand, ” and explains that the paintings he 
proposes to o ffer are the “flower of his stock ,” implying that many paint¬ 
ings by Rubens were not in fact executed for sped fie commissions hut 
were kept by him (he lists 12 paintings in his house). The deal went 
through, and Rubens then had the greatest collection of antique sculp¬ 
ture in northern Europe, until he in turn sold part of it a few years later. 
In the end, 123 marbles from Carleton were exchanged for nine paint¬ 
ings by Rubens and three by Tintoretto, as well as a set of tapestries from 
Rubens's collection. 

Most Excellent Sir: 

By the advice of my agent, I have learned that Your Excellency is very 
much inclined to make some bargain with me concerning your antiq¬ 
uities; and it has made me hope well of this business, to see that you 
go about it seriously, having told him the exact price that they cost 
you. In regard to this, I wish to place my complete trust in your 
knightly word. ... Your Excellency may be assured that I shall put 


prices on my pictures, just as if I were negotiating to sell them for 
cash; and in this I beg you to rely upon the word of an honest man. 
I find that at present I have in the house the flower of my stock, 
particularly some pictures which I have kept for my own enjoyment; 
some I have even repurchased for more than I had sold them to 
others. But the whole shall be at the service of Your Excellency, 
because I like brief negotiations, where each party gives and receives 
his share at once. To tell the truth, I am so burdened with commis¬ 
sions, both public and private, that for some years to come I cannot 
commit myself. Nevertheless, in case we agree as I hope, I will not 
fail to finish as soon as possible all those pictures that are not yet 
entirely completed, even though named in the list here attached. 
[In the margin: The greater part are finished.] Those that are finished 
I would send immediately to Your Excellency. In short, if Your 
Excellency will resolve to place as much trust in me as I do in you, 
the matter is settled. I am content to offer Your Excellency of the 
pictures by my hand, enumerated below, to the value of 6,000 
florins, at current cash prices, for all those antiquities in Your 
Excellency’s house, of which I have not yet seen the list, nor do I 
even know the number, but in everything I trust your word. Those 
pictures which are finished I will consign immediately to Your 
Excellency, and for the others that remain in my hands to finish, I will 
furnish good security to Your Excellency, and finish them as soon 
as possible. ...

sumptuously dressed in white satin, with a matching cape, bejew- 
eled with a rope of gold set with gems of onyx and rubies. Her 
huge, multilayered ruff, typical of her time and class, frames her 
face, and her red hair is arranged with decorative combs of pearls 
and feathers. The vast flowing red cloth, which unfurls behind 
her, contrasts with her dress and heightens the color of her face. 
The diagonal movement of this drapery also suggests her forward 
stride. The size, full-length view, elements of movement, and 
color against her face are just a few of the aspects that influenced 
Rubens’s student and assistant Anthony van Dyck (see figs. 20.7 
and 20.8) in his portraits. Later stately portraits of the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries also reflect such influences. 

OIL SKETCHES Rubens executed hundreds of oil sketches in 
preparation for his final works. They are small—small enough to 
hand to a patron—and represent the working art of preliminary 
concepts. An oil sketch for The Raising of the Cross , for example, 
suggests a less dynamic composition, changed in the final painting. 

Four Studies of the Head of a Negro (fig. 20.4) is not a sketch 
for any known larger piece, but we do know that Rubens used 
Africans in several of his paintings; studying the features and 
nuanced expressions of this man informed his work. It has been 
claimed that the four studies were done on separate occasions

over a few years, suggesting that this man was in Antwerp over an 
extended period—or left and returned. It is therefore likely that 
this African was a servant or a slave in a wealthy household. 
Rubens does not indicate his status; he is concerned only with his 
expressive sharply chiseled face. 

MARIE DE’ MEDICI CYCLE Rubens exhibited his virtuoso 
talent in portraits and monumental historical works in the 1620s 
with his famous cycle of paintings glorifying the career of Marie 
de J Medici, widow of Henry IV and mother of Louis XIII, in the 
Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The cycle consists of 21 paintings at 
least 13 feet high, with some as much as 28 feet wide. Rubens exe¬ 
cuted more than 35 sketches for these enormous paintings. Our 


illustration shows one episode: the young queen landing in 
Marseille (fig. 20.5). Rubens has turned an ordinary disembarka¬ 
tion into a spectacle of unparalleled splendor, combining reality 
and allegory. As Marie de’ Medici walks down the gangplank to 
enter France; she has already married Henry IV by proxy in 
Florence, but is yet to meet her husband. Accompanied by her 
sister and aunt as the allegorical figure, Fame flies overhead 
sounding a triumphant blast on two trumpets; she is welcomed by 
the allegorical figure of France draped in a fleur-de-lis cape. 
Neptune and his fish-tailed crew, the Nereids, rise from the sea; 
having guarded the queen s journey, they rejoice at her arrival. 
Everything flows together here in swirling movement: Heaven 
and earth, history and allegory.

RUBENS’S WORKSHOP To produce these large paintings, 
painting cycles, ceilings, and altarpieces, Rubens needed a large 
workshop; most of the Flemish artists working in the early seven¬ 
teenth century studied with him at some point. They often trav¬ 
eled with him, worked on paintings he had begun or sketched, or 
began paintings for him to complete. 

Rubens worked as a painter and a royal emissary. Diplomatic 
errands gave him entry to the royal households of the major 
powers, where he received numerous commissions. His duties 
took him to Paris, London, and Madrid—having already been to 
Italy—and he went to the Northern Netherlands to find an 
engraver for his work. He was truly an international artist. 

LATE RUBENS In the 1630s, after Rubens remarried at the 
age of 53, his art turned inward and he made many paintings of 
his beautiful young wife, home, and children. He even wrote of 
being “at home, very contented.” Rubens’s The Garden of Love 
(fig. 20.6) is a glowing tribute to life’s pleasures. It shows 
couples, cupids, and a lifelike statue of Venus (at the upper left) in 
a garden in front of a building, much like Rubens’s own Italianate 
house in Antwerp. Suggestions have been made that the male 
figure on the left is actually Rubens, and several of the women 
(mostly, the center-seated one) look like his new wife, Helene 
Fourment. Certainly, the sensuality of The Garden of Love paral¬ 
lels changes in his life. This painting and the Paris Marie de } 
Medici Cycle would influence eighteenth-century Rococo paint¬ 
ing (see page 763). 

Anthony van Dyck: History and 
Portraiture at the English Court 

Besides Rubens, only one other Flemish Baroque artist won inter¬ 
national acclaim: Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641). He was that 
rarity among painters: a child prodigy. Before he was 20, he had 
become Rubens’s most valued assistant. Like Rubens, he devel¬ 
oped his mature style only after a stay in Italy. 

As a history painter, Van Dyck was at his best in lyrical scenes 
of mythological love. Rinaldo and Armida (fig. 20.7) is taken from 
Torquato Tasso’s immensely popular poem about the crusades, 
Jerusalem Freed (1581), which gave rise to a new courtly ideal 
throughout Europe and inspired numerous operas, as well as 
paintings (a popular subject of Tiepolo, see page 781). Men and 
women at court masques played the roles of Christian Knight and 
Bewitching Sorceress in acting out this love-and-adventure story. 
Van Dyck shows the Sorceress falling in love with the Christian 
Knight she had intended to slay. The canvas reflects the ideals of 
Charles I, the English monarch for whom it was painted, and who 
found parallels in his own life with Tasso’s epic. The English 
monarch, nominally a Protestant, had married the Catholic 
Henrietta Maria, sister of his main rival, the king of France. 
Charles saw himself as the virtuous ruler of a peaceful realm much 
like the Fortunate Isle where Armida had brought Rinaldo. 
(Ironically, Charles’s reign ended in civil war.) The artist tells his 
story of ideal love in the pictorial language of Titian and Veronese, 


with an expressiveness and opulence that would have been the 
envy of any Venetian painter. The picture was so successful that it 
helped Van Dyck gain an appointment to the English court two 
years later. 

Van Dyck’s fame rests mainly on the portraits he painted in 
London between 1632 and 1641. The Portrait of Charles I 
Hunting (fig. 20.8) shows the king standing near a horse and two 
grooms in a landscape. Representing the sovereign at ease, the 
painting might be called a “dismounted equestrian portrait,” and 
it is vastly different in effect from Holbein’s Portrait of Henry 
VIII (see fig. 18.24). It is less rigid than a formal state portrait, but 
hardly less grand, for the king remains in full command of the 
state, which is symbolized here by the horse, which bows its head 
toward its master. The fluid movement of the setting comple¬ 
ments the self-conscious elegance of the king’s pose, which con¬ 
tinues the stylized grace of Hilliard’s portraits (see fig. 18.25). 
Charles’s political position, however, was less secure than his con¬ 
fidence here suggests. He was beheaded by his subjects in 1649. 
Charles was succeeded by the puritan leader Oliver Cromwell 
and his followers, known as the “Roundheads” in reference to

their short-cropped hair. In contrast, note that in the painting 
Charles Is tresses drop below his shoulder in the French 
(Catholic) manner. However, despite Charles s execution, his son, 
Charles II, assumed the throne later in the period known as the 
Restoration. 

Van Dyck has brought the court portrait up-to-date by using 
Rubens and Titian as his points of departure. He died eight years 
before the beheading of Charles I and so never had the chance to 
work for Charles s successors. But he created a new aristocratic 
portrait tradition that continued in England until the late eight¬ 
eenth century and which had considerable influence on the 
Continent as well. 

Local Flemish Art and Jacob Jordaens 

Jacob Jordaens (1593-1678) was the successor to Rubens and Van 
Dyck as the leading artist in Flanders. Jordaens was quite prolific 
and is known for his paintings, drawings, watercolors, and designs 
for tapestries. Unlike his predecessors, he did not travel to Italy, 
although he received commissions from outside the country— 


from the Northern Netherlands, as well as from the court of 
Sweden and a limited one from England. Although Jordaens was 
never formally a student of Rubens, he was a member of his 
workshop, and he collaborated with the older artist, turning to 
him for inspiration throughout his career. 

Jordaens s most characteristic subjects are mythological 
themes and works depicting eating and drinking such as his The 
King Drinks (fig. 20.9), one of several versions he executed of this 
popular subject marking the feast of the Epiphany or Three 
Kings, which in Flanders is celebrated on January 6th. 
Traditionally, on this date friends and family gather for a large 
dinner where a “king” is chosen, often by lot. But in Jordaens s 
paintings it is always the oldest man; usually, as is the case 
here, the appearance of the king is based on the features of his 
father-in-law and former teacher, Adam van Noordt (1562-1641), 
although we should not suppose this work to be a family portrait. 
Other roles—the queen, a musician, a jester (seen at top left)—are 
also assigned. Jordaens shows the most exuberant moment when 
all toast and shout: “The King drinks! ” This is a particularly 
rowdy scene where the physician (identified from his cap) vomits

on the left while a boys bottom (not even an infants!) is being 
wiped on the right—neither activity is suitable for a dinner table, 
but together they make a joyous painting. The painterly execution 
and figure types show a strong debt to Rubens, but Jordaen s 
figures are not idealized. There is a softness, roundness, and 
plainness to his life-size figures which distinguish his work. 
His paintings were purchased or commissioned by the newly 
prosperous middle class. 

The Bruegel Tradition 

Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625) was the principal heir of the 
tradition of his illustrious father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder (see 
Chapter 18), whom he hardly knew but whose work he copied. 
Jan Brueghel was largely a still-life painter and one of the innova¬ 
tors of the “art collection” paintings that are unique to Flanders 
and that provide us with a view into the depth and variety of 
European “art collections” which developed in the princely 
quarters of Antwerp in the seventeenth century. These eclectic 
collections were known as Kunstkammern (literally “rooms of 
art”) or Wunderkammem (“rooms of wonder”), and they give us 
a glimpse of the vast collections of exotica, from seashells, insects, 


and rare flowers to scientific instruments and paintings, that were 
accumulated by the aristocracy and the wealthy at that time. 

His Allegory of Sight (fig. 20.10) from a set of The Five Senses 
(paintings illustrating the senses of touch, smell, hearing, taste, and 
sight), each of the same size, executed with Rubens, shows such a 
Wunder- or Kunstkammer. The Allegory of Sight, viewed in an art 
gallery and appreciated only by seeing, is, of course, meant as a 
visual pun. The art collection seen here is that of the Habsburg 
archduke and archduchess (Albert and Isabella), depicted in a 
double portrait on the left (by Rubens), and suggests the wealth 
and splendor of the court. A double-headed eagle—the symbol of 
the Habsburgs—tops the brass chandelier. Albert and Isabella were 
Catholic rulers who would have associated this homage to the 
visible world with spiritual insight (explaining the painting of the 
Virgin and Child in the foreground). We obviously only glimpse 
part of the collection in the foreground, as the background at 
right indicates other rooms with more items (at left is a view of 
their castle outside Brussels), but the collection of paintings is 
prime here. We see scientific instruments (telescopes, globes), a 
Persian carpet (suggesting the bounty of the world), Roman por¬ 
trait busts, and large and small paintings: portraits, mythological 
scenes, and still lifes. Some of the paintings are recognizably by

Rubens and indicate his wide range—from a mythological scene 
featuring Silenus at the lower right to a lion and tiger hunt at the 
top left. The large painting seen at right showing the Virgin and 
Child encircled by a wreath of flowers, like the Allegory of Sight 
itself, is a collaborative effort between Brueghel and Rubens. In 
any collaboration, Brueghel would have begun the work, leaving 
areas for Rubens to fill in later, and then Brueghel would have 
returned to add the finishing touches. Jan Brueghel also collabo¬ 
rated with other artists and was a noted flower painter. 

Still-Life Painting 

Still-life painting in seventeenth-century Flanders took many 
forms—paintings of flowers, game, food, and precious objects. 
Even Jan Brueghel’s Allegory of Sight enters into this realm. We 
usually do not know who commissioned these works and pre¬ 
sume they were for private patrons for their homes. 

The century opens with predominantly simple paintings, but 
by midcentury this genre has begun to explore the elaborate and 
dramatic explosion of objects collected at that time. 


EARLY STILL LIFE! CLARA PEETERS Probably born in 
Antwerp, and most closely associated with that city, Clara Peeters 
(active 1607-ca. 1621) may have also worked in Haarlem, in the 
Netherlands. Her name, however, is not listed in any archival 
record in these cities, even though their guilds began to admit 
women and the number of signed works by Peeters indicate that 
she was a professional artist. Little is known of her life, patrons, 
or teachers. Nevertheless, she created some of the earliest still-life 
paintings. Still Life with Fruit and Flowers (fig. 20.11) is an early 
work that combines studies of both flowers and fruit and displays 
several different containers, exploring a variety of textures. In the 
center is a basket of fruit (apples, pears, plums, apricots, and fil¬ 
berts), flanked on the left by a bouquet of colorful flowers (roses, 
a tulip—a flower relatively new to western Europe, columbine, a 
marigold, a cornflower, borage, wild pansies, forget-me-nots, and 
lilies) in a white pottery vase. On the right is a pewter wine 
tankard (with a reflection of Peeters) and a silver tazza (an Italian- 
made plate) holding a bunch of grapes. Also on the right is a 
pewter plate with a glass of white wine and some nuts. Strewn 
across the wooden tabletop are prawns, a carnation, a plum, 


710 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 



cherries, a grasshopper, a strawberry, some gold and silver coins, 
and a knife. 

Although the natural life here is plentiful, it is the coins and 
knife that are particularly important for both dating and deter¬ 
mining the possible use or meaning of the painting. The coins 
have been dated to the reign of the Archduke Albert and 
Archduchess Isabella (1598-1621), and, based on the paintings 
style, a date of 1612 has been suggested. The knife (with its match¬ 
ing fork not seen here) is quite special and is of a type given as a 
wedding or betrothal gift. The same knife appears in several of 
Peeters s paintings and was probably copied from an actual one. It 
is inscribed in Latin with the words “fidelity” and “temperance,” 
and is illustrated with small allegorical figures with hearts and 
clasped hands. Such a knife would often be inscribed with the 
brides name; here, it is inscribed “Clara Peeters.” Thus, it has 
been suggested that she painted the work in celebration of her 
own wedding—and that all the fruits and flowers represent the 
bounty and hopefulness of this event. Such paintings were fre¬ 
quently hung in the dining rooms of houses and complemented 
the meals and festivities. Many of Clara Peeters s paintings still 
remain in private collections today. 


CAME STILL LIFE! FRANS SNYDERS A frequent collabo¬ 
rator with Rubens, Frans Snyders (1579-1657) studied with Pieter 
Brueghel the Younger (1564-1638), a son of Pieter Bruegel the 
Elder (see figs. 18.32-18.34) and with Jan Brueghel the Elder (see 
fig. 20.10). His splendid Still Life with Dead Game , Fruits , and 
Vegetables in a Market (fig. 20.12) is the first known “gamepiece” 
and is a masterpiece of its kind. 

Large and small items of game are for sale, but unlike the 
wares in Pieter Aertsens The Meat Stall (fig 18.31) these animals 
are whole and unbutchered. The sale of game was newly regulated 
(as of 1613) by laws detailing hours, location (in front of town 
halls as shown here), and season. Anyone who followed those 
rules could set up a stand and give the middle class—not just the 
privileged nobility—a legal and easily accessible way to purchase 
venison and other prized game. 

The artist revels in the virtuoso application of paint to create 
the varied textures of the game. The youth picking the old man’s 
pocket (he is greeting us, the middle-class customer, and not pay¬ 
ing attention to what is going on around him) and the cocks fight¬ 
ing in the foreground, as a cat looks on from the shadows beneath 
the low bench, further enliven the scene. Snyders subordinates

everything to the ensemble, which is characteristically Baroque in 
its lavishness and immediacy. The painting celebrates a time of 
peace and prosperity after the truce of 1609, when hunting was 
resumed in the replenished game preserves. 

THE FLAMBOYANT STILL LIFE! JAN DAVIDSZ. DE HEEM 

By midcentury, still-life paintings often presented lavish displays. 
These were known as pronk still lifes for their visual splendor, 
as pronk means “showy” or “ostentatious.” This type reached 
its peak in the work of Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606-1684). De 
Heem began his career in Holland but he soon moved to 
Antwerp, where he transformed the still life with his unique, 
flamboyant style. His Still Life with Exotic Birds (fig. 20.13) is a 
spectacular example. He depicts sumptuous commodities—deli¬ 
cious food, exotic birds, and luxurious goods—from around the 
world (see map 20.1). The conch and nautilus shells are from the 
West Indies, the gray parrot is from Africa, the scarlet macaw is 


from Brazil, and the brilliant lobsters are probably from the New 
World; the Seville oranges, plums, figs, melons, oysters, gilt gob¬ 
let, and silver ewer are all imported, commanding high prices 
in the marketplace. It is the whole world in one picture. And 
De Heem magnificently details the colors and textures of each of 
the objects. 

The food is piled up on pewter platters that are unstable and 
suggest extravagance. Unlike in the even, horizontal compositions 
of Peeters (see fig. 20.11), the silver pitcher, pewter plate, Venetian 
glass, and gilt goblet are set in varying heights, building up to a 
climax with the exotic birds. 

De Heem intends this display to be wondrous and theatrical, 
drawing back a curtain for us to see what is behind it. Even the 
column in the background is meant to suggest a heroic work. The 
result is a stunning, celebratory display that reveals the virtuosity 
of De Heem and defines the elements of the new style of pronk 
still life.

712 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 



THE DUTCH REPUBLIC 

Art in the Dutch Republic, unlike the art of Flanders, was not 
based largely on church or state commissions, but was one con¬ 
ducted primarily through private patronage and an open art mar¬ 
ket. Pictures became a commodity, and the trade in them followed 
the law of supply and demand. Many artists produced for the mar¬ 
ket rather than for individual patrons. Yet even the greatest masters 
were sometimes hard-pressed and could not fully support them¬ 
selves with the money earned from their art. It was not unusual 
for an artist to keep an inn or run a small business on the side. 

There were many artists—enough to form artistic communi¬ 
ties—in Haarlem, Utrecht, Amsterdam, and Delft, to name but a 
few. Artists frequently traveled between these cities and may have 
known each other s work, but most artists are usually associated 
with only one place—Hendrick Goltzius, Frans Hals and Judith 
Leyster with Haarlem; Hendrick Terbrugghen with Utrecht; 
Rembrandt with Amsterdam; and Jan Vermeer with Delft. Some 
of the paintings were religious in nature, but most were not. There 
were individual portraits, group portraits commissioned by civic 
groups, landscapes, cityscapes, architectural paintings, still lifes, 
and genre paintings. 

There were many types of paintings, and they ranged from 
large to small in size—small enough to hold in your hand or for 
ordinary people to hang on the walls of their homes. 

The Haarlem Academy: Hendrick Goltzius 

Like Rubens, Van Dyck, and even Jan Brueghel the Elder, many 
Dutch artists learned of the greatness of contemporary art in 
Rome and of its roots in antiquity by going there. And some, like 
Hendrick Goltzius (1558-1617), made numerous prints and 
drawings on their sojourn and brought them back for their own 
and others’ use. Goltzius (with two other artists, Karel van 
Mander and Cornells Cornelisz van Haarlem) created an “acad¬ 
emy” in Haarlem in 1585. We know little about it, but copying 
from prints, from antiquity, and from each other was part of their 
program. The academy also produced teachers for the next gener¬ 
ation and made the city of Haarlem a focal point for early Dutch 
painting, printmaking, and drawing. 

The collaborative efforts of the academy seem to be limited to 
Goltzius s engravings of the works by his colleagues. He was a 
masterful engraver, whose injured hand (burned in a childhood 
accident) may have provided the force behind his deep curvilinear 
cuts in the metal. (See Materials and Techniques , page 501.) He 
also executed woodcuts and only began painting after 1600. 

The engraving of the Farnese Hercules (fig. 20.14) illustrates 
the back of the Hellenistic sculpture owned by the Farnese fam¬ 
ily, housed in their palace, and also immortalized in a painting on 
a ceiling there (see fig. 19.7). It is seen here in its monumental, 
heroic scale, being viewed by two Dutch men—probably 
Goltzius s two companions in Italy during his trip of 1590-91. In 
many ways, it is an allegory for the wide-eyed Dutch experience 
in Rome—awed by this city filled with ruins, architecture, and

sculpture of an ancient past. (Indeed, the Dutch would later 
decide to keep as ruins those buildings nearly destroyed by the 
Spanish so as to have their own ruins of a heroic past.) This 
Hercules , like others in the same series, is also a very large print— 
a Herculean effort. Goltzius s trip to Italy was taken before the 
appearance of Caravaggio and the Baroque, and thus it was the art 
of the past, rather than contemporary Italian works, that had an 
impact on him. 

The Caravaggisti in Holland: 

Hendrick Terbrugghen 

The Baroque style came to Holland from Antwerp through the 
work of Rubens, and from Rome through contact with 
Caravaggio s followers. Although most Dutch painters did not go 
to Italy, the majority of those who went in the early years of the 
century were from Utrecht, a town with strong Catholic traditions. 
One of those artists from Utrecht, Hendrick Terbrugghen (1588— 
1629), worked in Italy for several years and was one of the first 


CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 713 
























20.1 5 Hendrick Terbrugghen, Singing Lute Player. 1624. Oil on canvas,

“Caravaggisti” to return to the North. He adapted Caravaggio s 
style for religious paintings, but also for the single-figure genre 
painting. Terbrugghens Singing Lute Player (tig. 20.15) is inspired 
by Caravaggio s painting of the same subject, by his Musicians (see 
fig. 19.4) and by the young men in his The Calling of St. Matthew 
(see fig. 19.2), who wear slashed doublets and feathered berets. 
Such life-size, half-length single-figure portraits, filling the entire 
canvas, became common in Utrecht and grew popular elsewhere 
in Holland. The Utrecht School transmitted the style of 
Caravaggio to other Dutch masters, such as Frans Hals. 

The Haarlem Community and Frans Hals 

One of the first to profit from these new ideas permeating the 
Dutch Republic was Haarlem artist Frans Hals (ca. 1585-1666), 
who was born in Antwerp. Hals captured his contemporaries in 
both portraiture and genre painting, and he excelled at combining 
the two—animating his portraits and setting his subjects in some¬ 
what relaxed or even casual stances. His genre painting, usually of 
single figures, portray characters that seem to be drawn from 
real life. 


HALS AND THE CIVIC GUARD Hals s six group portraits of 
the Civic Guards allowed him to provide multiple enlivened, life- 
size portraits in single dynamic paintings. The Civic Guards, 
founded in the fourteenth century, were local voluntary militia 
groups that were instrumental in defending their cities through 
military service. They also had civic and religious duties, and they 
began having their portraits painted in the early sixteenth century 
Although they had successfully defended their cities from the 
Spanish in the 1580s and, indeed, were proud of this accomplish¬ 
ment, with the truce of 1609, the Civic Guards became more like 
civic fraternities, with annual banquets, as seen in the Banquet of 
the O fficers of the St. George Civic Guard (fig. 20.16). The military 
aspects are indeed subordinated to the sense of general prosperity 
orchestrated in ritual. The captain in the center back wields a knife, 
but not as a military weapon; he is about to cut the roast. As was the 
custom, the colonel at the left raises his wine glass at the entrance 
of the standard-bearer with an unfurled banner. The highest- 
ranking officers are seated, while the men of lower rank and the 
servants stand at the back. The subjects arranged around a table 
laden with food on a white damask tablecloth, turn and face each 
other and the viewer. But 12 men around a table beg comparison 
with Leonardo s The Last Supper {see fig. 16.6). This is an undeni¬ 
ably secular painting, yet the event depicted is steeped in ceremony. 

Although the painting vividly suggests a moment in time at an 
actual gathering, art historians do not believe that Hals here 
painted an actual event. The officers did not pose for this seating. 
The realism comes from the life-size scale, their gestures, the 
three-dimensional modeling created by paint applied “wet-in¬ 
wet” (while initial paint is still wet) with strokes of varied width 
and length. This modeling generated its own vibrancy and thus 
the men appear as “speaking likenesses.” The Civic Guard paint¬ 
ing would become a staple in Haarlem and also in Amsterdam. 
Rembrandt s The Night Watch (see fig. 20.23) represents another 
form of this standard. 

In Hals s painting, the black-and-white fashions offset with 
the red-and-white sashes nearly vibrate, creating a brilliant 
tableau. These men, the officers of the company were wealthy cit¬ 
izens (in the case of Haarlem, they were brewers and merchants) 
who may have used their civic service to further their careers 
in government. Some even engaged Hals to execute individual 
portraits of themselves and family members; Hals himself became 
a member of the company in 1612. 

A WEDDING PORTRAIT Hals s only double portrait, Married 
Couple in a Garden (fig. 20.17), probably commemorates the 
wedding in 1622 of Isaac Massa (1586-1643) and his wife, Beatrix 
van der Laen (1592-1639). It combines the relaxed informal 
atmosphere of genre painting with the individual likenesses and 
formal attire of portraiture. This life-size couple modestly display 
their affection by sitting close together. Her arm is loped over his 
elbow, so displaying her rings (customary on the index finger); 
they smile broadly their eyes twinkling, as they sit in a garden— 
an imaginary Garden of Love—surrounded by ivy a symbol of 
steadfast love (as the ivy clings to the tree), faithfulness, and

fidelity. Indeed, they seem in love with each other. His right hand 
touches his chest (his heart) as a show of his intended affection. 
This painting makes a sharp contrast with Jan van Eycks The 
“Arnoljini Portrait ” (see fig. 14.14), and whether we interpret that 
earlier couples presence as signaling a betrothal, wedding, or 
contract, we can see that the emotional tie between the Arnolfini 
couple was not Van Eyck s concern. This is more than a difference 
in personal artistic style; it is the difference between the 
Renaissance and the Baroque, developing over the course of 200 
years. Between Van Eyck and Hals also stood Rubens, who had 
executed a wedding portrait of himself and his first wife that may 
have served as an example to Hals. 

Ingeniously, Hals set the couple off-center, which adds to the 
spontaneity; there is also a sense that Massa, open-mouthed, is 
speaking to us. They wear expensive lace cuffs; his is the lace col¬ 
lar customary for men whereas she wears a millstone collar, with 
an embroidered and ribboned cap, usually worn indoors or under 
another hat. He wears a broad-brimmed hat in the new French 
fashion. Her skirt is of silk; her vlieger (bodice) of velvet with 
broad shoulders is of a kind worn only by married women, so it 
identifies her status. 

Hals painted Massa, an important and wealthy diplomat, at 
least two more times as a single figure. Massa had an adventurous 


life: He was a geographer and a cartographer of Siberia. He trav¬ 
eled to Russia in 1600 and lived there for eight years, becoming 
fluent in the language. He was active in the fur trade and influen¬ 
tial in establishing trade routes between the Netherlands and 
Russia. But his worldliness is only barely suggested in this 
wedding portrait set in his own garden. 

HALS AND GENRE PAINTING Hals s mature style is seen in 
The Jolly To per (fig. 20.18), which perhaps represents an allegory 
of taste, one of the Five Senses, which were among the most pop¬ 
ular themes in the seventeenth century. The painting combines 
Rubens s robustness with a focus on the “dramatic moment” that 
Hals must have derived from Caravaggesque painters in Utrecht. 
Everything here conveys complete spontaneity: the twinkling 
eyes and half-open mouth, the raised hand, the teetering wine¬ 
glass, and—most important of all—the painters quick way of 
setting down the forms. Hals worked in dashing brushstrokes, 
each so clearly visible that we can almost count the total number 
of “touches.” Thanks to this open, split-second technique, the 
completed picture has the immediacy of a sketch. The impression 
of a race against time is, of course, deceptive. Hals undoubtedly 
spent hours on this life-size canvas, but he maintains the illusion 
of having done it all in the blink of an eye.

Hals, like Rembrandt van Rijn and Jan Vermeer, whom we 
will meet later in this chapter, is most closely identified with a 
period referred to as the Golden Age of Dutch Art. Individually 
these three artists took their northern heritage and developed 
from it the unique style of seventeenth-century Dutch art in 
Haarlem, Amsterdam, and Delft, respectively. Neither Hals, nor 
Rembrandt, nor Vermeer traveled to Italy. 

The Next Generation in Haarlem: 

Judith Leyster 

The most important follower of Hals was Judith Leyster 
(1609-1660), who was responsible for a number of works that 
once passed as Hals s own. She painted portraits and still lifes, but 
mostly genre paintings. Her Self-Portrait (fig. 20.19) shows 
Leyster as both a portrait and genre painter, and was executed to 
show her mastery of both. It was probably her presentation piece 
to the Guild of St. Luke in Haarlem in 1633, when she became a 


master and took on her own students. The painting on the easel is 
a detail of a popular work of hers; she uses this canvas to adver¬ 
tise her diverse talents. It also reveals her technical skill as she 
wields numerous brushes and a palette as she sits in her studio, 
open-mouthed, casually conversing with us. Many women artists, 
as Leyster does here, showed themselves painting—indicating 
their new professional status and their unique position. Indeed, 
Artemisia Gentileschi s Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting 
{La Pittura) (see fig. 19.6), executed about the same time, explores 
this same theme. 

Leyster also explored the relationship between men and women 
in her work—and frequently used candlelight scenes to create 
mood and intimacy Leyster s small lamplit The Proposition (fig. 
20.20) is one such painting. A man in a beaver hat (a foreigner) 
with coins in his hand approaches a woman who is diligently 
sewing. Is he offering to pay for her needlework? Clearly not. 
What are the clues to what he really wants? Leyster assigns the 
figures to a dark setting, whose lighting suggests intimacy His

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



Authenticity and Workshop: Rubens and Rembrandt 


R ubens and Rembrandt are among the many artists who ran work¬ 
shops employing other artists. Anthony van Dyck, Frans Snyders, 
and Jan Brueghel the Elder worked with Rubens as well as independ¬ 
ently. Frequently, paintings by Rubens will be attributed to “Rubens 
and Workshop.” By contrast, the idea of collaboration with Rembrandt 
in a workshop has been slow to develop. The notion of Rembrandt as 
a solitary genius endured through the twentieth century and has only 
recently been more carefully scrutinized. Paintings found to be not 
wholly by Rembrandt have been “demoted” and attributed to an artist 
of his workshop instead. Art historians have thus begun to rethink 
workshop practices. 

According to some art historians, Rembrandt’s oeuvre (the number 
of paintings he produced) was almost a thousand; other historians 
thought he had produced a few hundred. In the 1 960s, as exhibitions 
celebrating the 300th anniversary of his death were being organized 
(for 1 969), it became clear that art historians had different views of 
who Rembrandt was and what he did. As such, in 1968, the 
Rembrandt Research Project was set up, establishing a team of art 
historians who would use scientific methods as well as connoisseur- 
ship to establish the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt. 
They would study the wood and canvas supports, date the wood 


(a process called dendochronology), take x-rays, use infrared photog¬ 
raphy, examine paints and ground samples, and view the paintings 
in raking (strong) light. The researchers made their reports and 
jointly issued three volumes, The Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, 
reporting on works painted in 1625-31, 1 631 -34, and 1635-42; a 
fourth volume is devoted to self-portraits. Because of deaths and 
retirements, the committee’s personnel has since changed, but the 
project continues. 

Although their deliberate and scientific examinations have been 
incredibly useful and have provided a model for others engaged in 
such endeavors, their analysis of the attributions of Rembrandt works 
into three categories, A, B, and C, has been controversial: “A” for 
authentic works by Rembrandt; “B” for paintings that cannot be either 
accepted or rejected as authentic (the “B” category has been sarcasti¬ 
cally labeled by some as “Bothersome”); and “C” for works rejected as 
inauthentic and to be attributed to others, usually to named followers 
of Rembrandt. What is missing from this list, of course, is the notion 
of collaboration—the usual workshop method we have seen in the case 
of Rubens. Although Rembrandt and Rubens both had active work¬ 
shops over the course of their careers, art historians have chosen to 
view the art from these workshops differently. 


hand touches her shoulder. Indeed, in today’s jargon, she is being 
“hit on” by the intruder. A copy of the painting, which introduces 
a wine glass, points to what is missing here—any inference that 
the woman is interested. Such proposition paintings were in fact 
common, but they usually differ from this example in that they 
are often jovial and larger, showing women as active participants 
in this exchange of sex for money. Many were painted by the 
Utrecht Caravaggisti whose works Leyster may have known 
through her family’s stay near Utrecht. Her painting differs mark¬ 
edly from these, though, as the woman does not appear interested. 
This intriguingly different point of view has been attributed to the 
fact that the artist is a woman. The painting is signed with her 
monogram, a conjoined “ J, ” “L,” and star, punning on her name, 
which means “leading star. ” Indeed, Leyster was referred to and 
celebrated during her lifetime as a “leading star” in art. 

After her marriage to a fellow student of Halss, Jan Miense 
Molenaer (ca. 1610-1668), the couple moved from Haarlem to 
Amsterdam where Leyster continued to paint, although the main 
body of her oeuvre was executed in Haarlem. Leyster’s exploration 
of domestic genre painting and the poetic quality of the light in her 
canvases means that her work bridges the generation gap between 
the Caravaggisti and Jan Vermeer (see figs. 20.34 and 20.35). 

Rembrandt and the Art of Amsterdam 

Like Hals and Leyster, Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669) was 
influenced indirectly by Caravaggio through the Utrecht School. 
Rivaling Rubens as the most famous artist of his age, Rembrandt is 


perhaps the better-known of the two today. A painter, draftsman, 
and printmaker, he is equally significant in each medium. 
Rembrandt is known both for the intimacy and poignancy of 
his images which convey personal relationships and emotions 
(see www.myartslab.com) —an aspect seldom explored before—as 
well as for producing large group portraits and history pieces. 
He had an active workshop (see The Art Historian's Lens , 
above) for four decades and many of his followers became 
significant artists in his native Leiden or in Amsterdam, where he 
established himself. 

REMBRANDT’S DRAWINGS The poignancy of his drawings 
can be seen in many of his studies “from life”—that is, made 
with the model before him. He drew in pen and ink, wash, red or 
black chalk, silverpoint, and combinations of these. Rembrandt’s 
drawing of his wife, Portrait ofSaskia van Uylenburgh (fig. 20.21), 
upon their engagement, is executed in silverpoint, an unforgiving 
drawing tool (commonly used before the invention of the pencil) 
that requires precision and a sure hand, on parchment. It is clearly 
meant as a very special drawing to commemorate their betrothal. 
The inscription states (in Dutch): “This is drawn after my wife, 
when she was 21 years old, the third day of our betrothal, the 8th 
of June 1633.” They were married a year later; the drawing shows 
a dreamy-eyed Saskia looking very much in love with the viewer 
(the artist). She wears a straw hat, usually associated with shep¬ 
herdesses, country life, and pastoral, amorous scenes. The flowers 
in her hat and hands further embellish this idea. Saskia came from 
a well-to-do family and was the niece of Rembrandt’s art dealer.

Her features appear in many of the paintings and studies for etch¬

REMBRANDT’S PAINTINGS Rembrandt s earliest paintings are 
small, sharply lit, and intensely realistic. Many deal with Hebrew 
Bible subjects, a lifelong preference on the part of the artist. (See 
www.myartslab.com; see also figs. 20.22 and 20.25.) They show 
both his greater realism and his new, more emotional attitude. 
Rembrandt and, indeed, many other seventeenth-century Protest¬ 
ants viewed the stories of the Hebrew Bible in much the same lay 
Christian spirit that governed Caravaggio s approach to the New 
Testament—as direct accounts of God s dealings with his human 
creations. Some of Rembrandt s biblical paintings were produced 
for the princely court in The Hague (despite the Reformation, the 
use of such images died hard), as well as for private patrons. 

How strongly these stories affected him is clear in The 
Blinding of Samson (fig. 20.22). Painted in the Baroque style he

developed in the 1630s after moving to Amsterdam, it shows 
Rembrandt as a master storyteller. The artist depicts the Hebrew 
Bible world as full of Oriental splendor and violence, and he is 
directly influenced by Caravaggio through the Utrecht 
Caravaggisti. The theatrical light pouring into the dark tent 
heightens the drama to the same pitch as The Raising of the 
Cross (see fig. 20.1) by Rubens, whose work Rembrandt sought to 
rival. But Rembrandts decision not to travel to Italy to see 
the art of antiquity or the Renaissance for himself may have 
limited his opportunities to widen his experiences and to see 
contemporary art, as well. (See wwwmyartslab.com. ) Instead, he 


brought the outside world to himself. Rembrandt was an avid 
collector of Near Eastern objects, which often served as props in 
his pictures. 

REMBRANDT AND THE CIVIC GUARD By the 1640s, 
Rembrandt had become Amsterdam’s most sought-after portrait 
painter, and a man of considerable wealth. His famous group 
portrait (fig. 20.23) known as The Night Watch , because of its 
old darkened varnish (now cleaned off), was painted in 1642. It 
shows a military company in the tradition of Frans Halss Civic 
Guard groups (see fig. 20.16), possibly assembling for the visit 


720 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






of Marie de 5 Medici of France to Amsterdam. Although the 
members of the company had each contributed toward the cost of 
the huge canvas (originally it was much larger), Rembrandt did 
not give them equal weight pictorially. He wanted to avoid the 
mechanically regular designs of earlier group portraits—a prob¬ 
lem only Frans Hals had solved successfully. Instead, he made the 
picture a virtuoso performance filled with movement and lighting, 
which captures the excitement of the moment and provides a 
unique sense of drama. The focus is on Captain Frans Banning 
Cocq, whose hand extends toward us and even creates a shadow 
across the yellow jacket of his lieutenant; other figures are 
plunged into shadow or hidden by overlapping. Legend has it that 
the people whose portraits Rembrandt had obscured were not 
satisfied with the painting, but there is no evidence for this claim. 
On the contrary, we know that the painting was much admired 
in its time, and Rembrandt continued to receive major public 
commissions in the 1650s and 1660s. 

REMBRANDT AS PRINTMAKER Rembrandt s etchings show 
a new depth of feeling leant by the intimacy of the print medium. 
The Hundred Guilder Print (fig. 20.24), which has been interpreted 


as a depiction of the entire nineteenth chapter of the Gospel of 
St. Matthew, combines various aspects of Christs preachings, 
including the healing of the multitudes, and the gathering to him 
of children and those who had been forsaken. This is crystallized 
in the phrase which has been associated with the print from a con¬ 
temporary poem: “The Son of God in a world of sorrow. ...” The 
print is filled with pathos, revealing a humble world of bare feet 
and ragged clothes. The scene reveals Christ s deep compassion 
for the poor and outcast, who make up his audience in the print. 
Rembrandt had a special sympathy for the Jews, both as heirs of 
the biblical past and as victims of persecution, and they were often 
his models and also his patrons. The setting of this print suggests 
some corner in Amsterdam where the Jews had found a haven; they 
are used here to provide an “authentic” setting for Christ s teach¬ 
ings. Rembrandt incorporates observations of life from the draw¬ 
ings he made throughout his career; several of these drawings have 
been identified as studies for this work. Here, as in Caravaggio s 
The Calling of St. Matthew (see fig. 19.2), it is the magic of light 
and dark that gives the etching its spiritual significance. 

The print derives its name from a story that 100 guilders 
was the great price paid for it at a contemporary auction. It is a

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Etching , Dry point, and Selective Wiping 


E tching is a form of intaglio printing. The modern technique calls 
for a metal plate to be cut by the artist using acid. The process 
begins with the metal plate initially being coated with a waxy sub¬ 
stance. Instead of gouging grooves directly in the metal, the artist 
can lightly “draw” on the plate with a stylus, thereby removing the 
waxy coating and revealing the metal beneath. The plate is then 
placed in an acid bath, and the revealed metal will react with the 
acid, which will burn away the metal to create grooves. The plate is 
then removed, wiped off, and covered in ink. The excess ink is then 
wiped off, leaving ink only in the grooves. As with engraving, damp¬ 
ened paper is used to cover the plate. This is then rolled through a 
press. But because the acid continues to burn the metal, the etched 
lines may be uneven, and depending on the length of time spent in 
the acid bath, the grooves may be deeper. With etching, therefore, 
the actual creation is much like drawing (artists may even carry pre¬ 
pared plates with them), but the finished process also includes a 
component of chance. 

The possibilities for creating greater tonal qualities increased 
with the introduction of different varieties of paper. In the seven¬ 
teenth century, several printmakers, including Rembrandt, used 
papers ranging in quality and origin, from fine laid to a creamy, 
nubby oatmeal paper, to tan Chinese and Japanese papers, which 
seemed to make the blacks even blacker. Rembrandt also printed on 
vellum and even on pigskin. 

The range of blacks was further extended by the use of drypoint. 
Drypoint is the process of picking out the metal on a plate with a 


fine, hard needle and leaving the burr, the metal filings, which will then 
gather up the ink. This process has the possibility of creating areas of 
higher black density, as in Rembrandt’s The Hundred Guilder Print (see fig. 
20.24). Drypoint is often used in combination with etching and engraving. 

Another option for creating greater tonal range is not to wipe the plate 
completely clean. This is called selective wiping. It can achieve an over¬ 
all dark tone, creating chiaroscuro effects. In some cases, Rembrandt 
seems to have hardly wiped the plate at all, keeping it mostly inked. This 
very selective wiping was used to create nocturnal tenebristic effects. 
Rembrandt’s printed images created an enthusiasm for these dark etch¬ 
ings, and a new form of etching was developed in the late seventeenth 
century, called mezzotint. This is a process of creating many indenta¬ 
tions in the metal so that almost the entire plate (called a “rocked” plate) 
will print dark and only a few areas, smoothed out by the artist, will print 
light. This process has recently been revived with the availability of pre¬ 
pared “rocked” plates. 

In each of these processes, changes are possible. The initial print is 
called a state. In each case, after printing one example, the artist can 
make a change. The second printing, using the same plate or block, is 
called a second state. There can be many states for a single print. The 
block or plate is therefore quite valuable and can be used again many 
years later—even after the artist’s death, thereby providing family mem¬ 
bers or others with income. The block or plate can be purchased, and 
those who make new prints can even produce new states. Sometimes the 
artist will deface a plate (called “striking” it) to prevent unauthorized 
people from using it.

virtuoso combination of etching and drypoint (see Materials and 
Techniques , above), creating a velvety tone that can only be sug¬ 
gested in the reproduction here. Rembrandts importance as a 
graphic artist is second only to Diirer s, although we get no more 
than a hint of his virtuosity from this single example. 


MATURE WORK Both poignant and “from life,” Rembrandt s 
monumental painting of Bathsheba with King David's Letter (fig. 
20.25) is a stunning work. We know nothing of its commissioning 
or later purchase. The subject of the painting, from 2 Samuel 
11:2-27, would have been familiar to seventeenth-century viewers: 


722 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 













The biblical King David noticed the beautiful, but married, 
Bathsheba at her bath and summoned her. Thus began a series of 
events culminating in her pregnancy, the death of her husband, 
specifically sent to the front lines of battle to be killed, her 
marriage to King David, and the birth of her son who would be 
King Solomon. Although in the biblical account Bathsheba does 
not actually receive a letter, this prop became part of the visual 
tradition along with the attendant performing the pedicure at left. 

The large nude, so close to our space, confronts us—even 
though she does not. Bathsheba with deep sadness and melan¬ 
choly looks down at Davids letter, contemplating its conse¬ 
quences and the loss of her own innocence. Indeed, Bathsheba, 
in the seventeenth century, was not considered innocent but 
complicit in allowing the king to see her body and therefore in 
betraying her marriage vows. The painting itself is not eroticized, 
but the sheer fleshiness and palpability of her body makes the 
sensual difficult to ignore. This work brings to mind the many 


life-size nudes by Titian (see fig. 17.35), but our painting is of a 
flawed human, while Titian s is that of a goddess. Rembrandt s 
Bathsheba is formed of flesh and light in contrast to the color of 
Titian s subject. Bathsheba is not at all idealized and contempo¬ 
rary criticism faults Rembrandt for this. “Fat swollen belly, hang¬ 
ing breasts, garter marks” were descriptions associated with 
Rembrandt s nudes. We cannot escape her disturbing reality and 
get lost in the narrative of the painting—as there isn’t one. The 
work remains an icon of vulnerability. 

Because Hendrickje Stoffels, Rembrandts wife (as she was 
known, although they were never officially married; Saskia had 
died 12 years before), was also pregnant in 1654 and because she 
was summoned in July of that year to appear before a church 
committee which censured her for living in sin with Rembrandt, 
it has been suggested—nearly unanimously—that Bathsheba is a 
portrait of Hendrickje, or that Hendrickje is shown in the guise 
of Bathsheba. As tantalizing as this association is, there is no

CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 723 



known image of Hendrickje, although many paintings have been 
called “Rembrandt’s wife.” But without knowing what 
Hendrickje looked like the connection with the Bathsheba is only 
speculation. The painting remains a poignant, powerful example 
of an aching drama. Creating a work of significant emotional 
impact was Rembrandt s forte in his mature years. 

SELF-PORTRAITURE Although no likeness of Hendrickje is 
known, likenesses of Rembrandt are common, since he painted 
many self-portraits over his long career. They are experimental in 
the early Leiden years, theatrically disguised in the 1630s, and 
frank toward the end of his life. Many reasons for their execution 
have been suggested—as models for other paintings, as explo¬ 
rations of different expressions, and as possible advertisements for 
his craft. While our late example (fig. 20.26) is partially indebted 
to frontally posed Venetian portraits, Rembrandt examines him¬ 
self with a typically northern European candor. The bold pose 
and penetrating look bespeak a resigned but firm resolve that 


suggests princely nobility, which is materially underlined by his 
richly brocaded gold collar, fur mantle, and silver staff (sceptor?). 
A comparison with Holbeins Henry VIII (see fig. 18.24) suggests 
the similar concept of authority, but in the latter Holbein s inter¬ 
est in the detail of fabric and jewels dominates while Rembrandt 
uses chiaroscuro to suggest mood. There is also a marked differ¬ 
ence in technique, as Rembrandt uses impasto, which is the layer¬ 
ing of paints and glazes to achieve textured and atmospheric 
effects. Rembrandt painted several large self-portraits, including 
this one, toward the end of his life, and the acquisition of a “large 
mirror” (its breakage is documented) may have allowed him to 
do this. 

Rembrandt and his school dominated Amsterdam. Rembrandt 
produced many history paintings, portraits, and etchings, and is 
known for his depictions of the inner person and for revealing the 
pathos in a scene or moment. His works are famous for their 
poignancy and came to represent the epitome of the Golden Age 
of Dutch Art.

THE MARKET: LANDSCAPE, 
STILL-LIFE, AND GENRE PAINTING 

While Italian art was dominated by private patronage or that of 
the Church, art in northern Europe was largely made for the open 
market. Of course, portraits and group portraits, like those for the 
Civic Guards, were commissioned works, but a great number of 
paintings were also made “on spec”—that is, with the hope that 
they would be purchased on the open market from dealers, fairs, 
stores, and lotteries. We know (see Primary Source, page 704) that 
Rubens kept paintings in stock for his own use, and that these 
were not commissioned works. Perhaps with princely patrons in 
mind, Rubens painted many large works, but in Holland, paint¬ 
ings were often small, and featured subjects suitable for a middle- 
class home. Most art buyers in the Dutch Republic preferred 
images within their own experience: landscapes, architectural 
views, still lifes, and genre (everyday) scenes. These subjects, we 
recall, emerged in the latter half of the sixteenth century (see page 
653). As the subjects became fully defined, artists began to 
specialize. Although this trend was not confined to Holland, 
Dutch painting became famous for both its volume and variety. 

The richest of the newly developed “specialties” was land¬ 
scape, both as a portrayal of familiar views and as an imaginative 
vision of nature. Landscapes—frequently with only small human 
figures or none at all—became a staple of seventeenth-century 
Dutch painting. We can see the beginnings of this in the work of 
Pieter Bruegel the Elder (see fig. 18.32) and in Italy as well, in 
such paintings as Carracci s Landscape with the Flight into Egypt 
(see fig. 19.8). But in the Netherlands, greater realism, almost a 


“portrait of the land,” was common. A contemporary said of 
these landscapes: “nothing is lacking except the warmth of the sun 
and the movement caused by the gentle breeze.” 

Landscape Painting: Jan van Go yen 

Jan van Goyen s (1596-1656) Pelkus Gate Near Utrecht (fig. 
20.27), a seascape or marine painting, is the kind of landscape that 
enjoyed great popularity because its elements were so familiar: the 
distant town, with a low horizon line, under an overcast sky, seen 
through a moist atmosphere across an expanse of water. Van 
Goyen executed about a dozen paintings of this site, each featur¬ 
ing the fourteenth-century gate (which no longer exists). But we 
can see from his drawings of the site that the views are not exact, 
but a patchwork of reality and imaginary. The painting is charac¬ 
teristic of Van Goyen s ability to combine the familiar with the 
picturesque, creating a melancholic mood of these “nether lands,” 
ever threatened by the sea, but also in need of it. 

Like other early Dutch Baroque landscapists, Van Goyen 
frequently used only grays and browns, highlighted by green 
accents; but within this narrow range he achieved an almost 
infinite variety of effects. The tonal landscape style in Holland 
was accompanied by radically simplified compositions, and we 
see this effect in a monochromatic still-life painting (see fig. 20.31) 
of the same time. As he worked in several cities (Haarlem, Leiden, 
and The Hague), Van Goyen was especially influential and 
extremely prolific; he is credited with over 1,200 paintings and 
800 drawings. His family is also evidence of the interrelationship 
of artists—his daughter married the genre painter Jan Steen (see 
page 730).

City Views: Jacob van Ruisdael 

Identifiable city views—panoramic landscapes with their outlying 
countryside and picturesque sand dunes, showing Amsterdam, 
Haarlem, Deventer—became popular throughout the century In 
the art of Jacob van Ruisdael (ca. 1628-1682), these views become 
testaments to the city skyline—and to the sky, which might 
occupy three-quarters of the painting, as it does in this painting of 
Haarlem (fig. 20.28). Ruisdael did many paintings of Haarlem, 
known as Haarlempjes (little views of Haarlem). The church 


spires, windmills, and ruins are all identifiable, as is the major 
church, the Grote Kerk (Big Church), known before the 
Reformation as St. Bavo (see fig. 20.30). In the foreground are the 
bleaching fields, where both domestic and foreign linen was 
washed and set out to be bleached by the sun. Haarlem water was 
well known for its purity and so the city was famous for its linen 
bleaching and beer production. 

A heightened sense of drama is the core of Ruisdaels The 
Jewish Cemetery (fig. 20.29). Natural forces dominate this wild 
scene, which is imaginary except for the tombs from the Jewish

cemetery near Amsterdam. As we have seen in Rembrandt s work 
(see fig. 20.24), Jews had been living in Amsterdam through the 
seventeenth century—some, often poor, from Germany and 
eastern Europe, others, often more prosperous, newly arrived 
from Brazil, where they went to seek refuge from the Inquisition 
in Spain. The cemetery, called Bet Haim (House of Life), 
belonged to the latter group, the Sephardic or Portuguese and 
Spanish Jews. Each of the tombs has been identified, and, though 
appearing ancient, they were all erected in the seventeenth 
century. Several drawings of this site by Ruisdael exist, as do 
prints by other artists. Jews in Amsterdam were exotic—the 
“other”—and this may account for the themes popularity 
Foreigners who came to Amsterdam visited and wrote about this 
community with curiosity and even awe. 


Ruisdael adds other nonrealistic elements to his imaginary wild 
scene: The ruined building in the background has been identified 
as Egmond Abbey (Catholic), which suggests a contrast between 
Jews and Catholics—or perhaps a complementary relationship— 
since both are superseded in the Dutch Republic by the Reformed 
Church. Thus, the theme of death—the cemetery the tombs, the 
crumbling ruins of the abbey and the dead trees—suggests the 
painting is a vanitas, a memorial to the brevity of life. The term 
comes from the biblical book of Ecclesiastes and its phrase “van¬ 
ity of vanities. ” It is a text on the passage of time and on mortality, 
just as this painting is also a visual reminder of the shortness of 
life. Yet the cemetery is arched by a rainbow, a sign of Gods prom¬ 
ise of redemption. The Jewish Cemetery inspires that awe on which 
the Romantics, 150 years later, based their concept of the sublime. 


CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 727 






Architectural Painting: Pieter Saenredam 

In contrast to the dramatic mood and theatrical setting of The 
Jewish Cemetery , there are many examples, in paintings, prints, 
and drawings, of more realistic, descriptive images of the 
Sephardic synagogue and many of the austere Reformed 
churches. The Interior of the Choir of St. Bavo’s Church at 
Haarlem (fig. 20.30), painted by Pieter Saenredam (1597-1665), 


one of 11 such views that he painted, is meant to serve as more 
than a mere record. It is, in fact, an impossible view, suggesting a 
greater sense of vastness in the medieval structure than actually 
exists. Saenredam went to great lengths to construct his paintings. 
First, he made both freehand sketches and measured drawings in 
the church. His next step was to combine the two in additional 
drawings. Finally, he would paint a representation of the church 
that utilized accurate details from his drawings but also included

exaggerated elements for effect. This is the same church that is the 
focus of Ruisdael s Bleaching Grounds Near Haarlem (see fig. 
20.28). It is shown here stripped of all furnishings and white¬ 
washed under the Protestants, and it has acquired a crystalline 
purity that invites spiritual contemplation through the painting s 
quiet intensity. (Both Saenredam and Frans Hals would be buried 
here.) The tiny figures in the interior provide scale and often 
narrative. Note the fellow at right looking out of the triforium. 

Still-life Painting: Willem Claesz. Heda 

Dutch still lifes may show the remains of a meal—suggesting 
pleasure—and luxury objects, such as crystal goblets, glasses of 
different sizes, and silver dishes, chosen for their contrasting 
shapes, colors, and textures. Flowers, fruits, and seashells may 
also be shown. All are part of the world of still life. And these are 
not too different from the ingredients in a Flemish still life; many 
artists, such as Clara Peeters and Jan Davidsz. de Heem, traveled 
between both regions. 

As seen here in his Still Life with Oysters , a Roemer , a Lemon , 
and a Silver Bowl (fig. 20.31), the Haarlem artist Willem Claesz. 
Heda (1594-1680) was fascinated by surfaces and reflections—the 
rough edge of the lemon, the liquid, slimy quality of the oysters, 


the engraving on the silver, the sparkling light on the roemer 
(wine glass), its multiple reflections of the window, and its prunts 
(glass drops). Heda is famous for such light effects, which are 
heightened by the tonal quality of the painting, which is largely 
monochromatic, much as in Jan van Goyen s landscape (see fig. 
20.27), also of midcentury. These are in marked contrast to the 
colorful Flemish works of Clara Peeters and Jan Davidsz. de Heem 
(see figs. 20.11 and 20.13). The table is set with white wine, beer 
(back right), lemon, and a paper of pepper in a cone to use with 
the oysters, which were known to be aphrodisiacs. Yet the broken 
glass and overturned silver tazza suggest some upheaval on a narra¬ 
tive level. Whoever sat at this table was suddenly forced to leave the 
meal. The curtain that time has lowered on the scene, as it were, 
gives the objects a strange pathos. The unstable composition, with 
its signs of a hasty departure, suggests transience—a vanitas. 

Flower Painting: Rachel Ruysch 

The independent floral still life seems to have begun in Flanders, 
but it developed in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands. 
Rachel Ruysch (1664-1750) was one of the leading Dutch flower 
painters of the day, and was lauded as such in her lifetime. She had 
a long and prolific career and worked in Amsterdam, The Hague,

and Diisseldorf, where she and her husband, Juriaen Pool II 
(1665-1745), a portraitist, became court painters to the Elector 
Palatine until his death. One could say she was born to be a flower 
painter, as her father was a professor of anatomy and botany. 
Ruysch knew every blossom, every butterfly moth, and snail that 
she put into a piece intimately We know from the inclusion of 
flowers in earlier paintings, such as the lilies in a vase in the 
Merode Triptych (see fig. 14.8), that flowers can have meaning 
beyond their beauty The flowers in figure 20.32, some with wild 
and impossibly long stems that stretch across the diagonal of the 
canvas, are arranged to create an extravaganza of color. Like the 
Heda Still Life with Lemon and Oysters (see fig. 20.31) with its 
broken glass, this still life features fallen, drooping flowers, and 
their near-death state again suggests a vanitas theme. 


Genre Painting: Jan Steen 

Many of the same themes continue to be featured in genre paint¬ 
ing at the end of the seventeenth century, but the paintings now 
contain more complex narratives. Often, there are interior scenes 
of homes and taverns. The human figures are often no longer half- 
length; they are shown full length instead, even when the paint¬ 
ings are small, creating a further sense of intimacy The paintings 
of Jan Steen, Jan Vermeer and Gerard ter Borch provide a range of 
subject matter, from the comical to the deeply introspective, while 
offering a glimpse of home, and family life, relationships, and 
even the fashions of the seventeenth century A scene of both 
comical circumstance and family intimacy—much in the vein 
of Jordaens s The King Drinks (see fig. 20.9)—can be seen in The 
Feast of St. Nicholas (fig. 20.33) by Jan Steen (1626-1679). 


730 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 



St. Nicholas has just paid his pre-Christmas visit to the household 
on 5 December, leaving toys, candy, and cake for the children. The 
little girl and boy are delighted with their presents. She holds a 
doll of St. John the Baptist and a bucket filled with sweets, while 
he plays with a golf club and ball. Everybody is jolly except their 
brother, on the left, who has received only a birch rod (held by the 
maidservant) for caning naughty children. Soon his tears will turn 
to joy, however: His grandmother, in the background, beckons 
him toward the bed, where a toy is hidden. 

Steen tells the story with relish, embroidering it with many 
delightful details. Of all the Dutch painters of daily life, he was 


the sharpest and best-humored observer. To supplement his earn¬ 
ings, he kept an inn, which may explain his keen insight into 
human behavior. His sense of timing and his characterizations 
often remind us of Frans Hals (see figs. 20.16-20.18), while his 
storytelling stems from the tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder 
(see fig. 18.33). Steen was also a gifted history painter, and 
although portions of his work are indeed humorous, they usually 
convey a serious message as well. The Feast of St. Nicholas has 
just such content: The doll of St. John the Baptist is meant as a 
reminder of the importance of spiritual matters over worldly 
possessions, no matter how pleasurable the latter might be.

CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 731 


















Intimate Genre Painting: Jan Vermeer 

In the genre scenes of the Delft artist Jan Vermeer (1632-1675), 
by contrast, there is seldom a clear narrative. Vermeer s reputation 
rests on only a small number of paintings (about 35), but these are 
indeed quite special. Vermeer may have studied in Amsterdam 
and/or Utrecht, but he was certainly familiar with old and con¬ 
temporary works as he, like his father, worked as an art dealer. 

In an early work, Officer and Laughing Girl (fig. 20.34), the 
figures are in a room infused by a nearly glowing light. The young 
woman sits beneath a large, contemporary map of the 
Netherlands (on its side), smiles cheerfully, and offers the man a 
glass of wine. We see only the silhouette of the man dressed in red, 
as light from the left-hand window pours in between them so that 
the entire painting seems to sparkle with light. 

Vermeer s use of light, frequently coming from a window at 
the left and creating flecks of light on fabric and reflections, marks 
his work. To achieve these effects and create a perfectly balanced 
painting, he seems to have used techniques that are both old and 
new. Vermeer may have used a camera ohscura , an experimental 
optical device (a forerunner of the photographic camera) that 


created an image by means of a hole for light on the inside of a 
dark box. The hole acts as a primitive lens and a scene from out¬ 
side the box can be seen, inverted, inside it. It is not suggested here 
that Vermeer copied such scenes, but he may have been inspired 
by them. Camera ohscura scenes have a sparkling quality, often 
seen in parts of Vermeer s work (as seen here in the gold threads 
in the womans dress). These sparkling areas are known as “discs 
of confusion. ” The camera ohscura was well known, and there is 
considerable evidence that it was used by Dutch artists. Further, 
Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the modern micro¬ 
scope, lived in Delft at the same time, which suggests a local inter¬ 
est in practical optics. 

This new way of looking is paired in Vermeer s work with an 
old way—a one-point perspective view with a vanishing point. 
It has been shown that a hole (for a pin and string) was set in a 
number of Vermeer s paintings to create a one-point perspective 
system. And indeed a vanishing point with pinhole is also observ¬ 
able in an x-ray. The vanishing point in this painting is set 
between the two figures and as such we do not focus on either one 
of them, but we are drawn to the space in between instead—to the 
very seduction of the relationship. It is the wall we focus on, with

its subtle and varying tones of gray, yellow, and blue on a seem¬ 
ingly white surface. These are the same colors used for the map. 
Vermeer created an unparalleled quality of light and texture. 

Vermeer is best known for his single figures, usually women, 
seemingly engaged in everyday tasks at private moments. They 
exist in a timeless “still-life” world, as if becalmed by a spell. In 
Woman Holding a Balance (fig. 20.35), a young woman, richly 
dressed in the at-home wear of the day, is contemplating the bal¬ 
ance in her hand, with strings of pearls and gold coins spread out 
on the table before her. The painting gives a view into such a still- 
life world—with a table laden with pearls and gold, paintings and 
fur, all magically providing an eternal, yet momentary, glance into 
a private world where, in fact, our view is not acknowledged. The 
painting in the background depicts Christ at the Last Judgment, 
when every soul is weighed. This may refer to the soul of the 
pregnant womans unborn child, and it parallels her own activity, 
now contemplating the future of her unborn child. The pans of 
the balance were once thought to contain gold or pearls but sci¬ 
entific analysis of the painting indicates that they actually contain 
nothing, only beads of light. The painting is intensely private, 


quiet, yet also highly sensual, created with optical effects that 
make the surface shimmer. It is the light on the pan and the pearls 
that we see as “discs of confusion.” The vanishing point in this 
painting, where a hole has punctured the canvas, is just to the 
left of the pinky finger that holds the balance. Our eye is drawn 
to this spot and is fascinated by this tentative gesture. It sets the 
balance of all elements of the painting. 

Vermeers mastery of lights expressive qualities raises his 
interest in the reality of appearances to the level of poetry. He is 
concerned with all of light s visual and symbolic possibilities. 
Woman Holding a Balance is also testimony to the artist s faith: 
He was a Catholic (as was Jan Steen) living in Protestant Holland, 
where his religion was officially banned, although worship in 
private houses was tolerated. 

But all of these facts somehow do not get to the magical, 
hypnotic, truly original nature of his paintings. We do not know 
Vermeer s teachers or how he developed his unique style. No 
painter since Jan van Eyck saw as intensely as Vermeer. No 
other painter recorded his seeing in such an exact yet somehow 
personal way 


CHAPTER 20 THE BAROQUE IN THE NETHERLANDS 733 








Exquisite Genre Painting: Gerard ter Borch 

Perhaps the most elegant—even exquisite—Dutch genre paint¬ 
ings were executed by Gerard ter Borch (1617-1681), who 
worked in the small city of Zwolle, but traveled widely both 
within Holland (he worked in Amsterdam and briefly in 
Haarlem) and Europe. He came from a family of artists but little 
is known of his patrons or commissions. He painted both 
portraits and genre scenes; both types were often small (about 
the size of a notebook), but the figures were full-length and 
attired in the height of fashion. Such is the case in the Lady at 
Her Toilet (fig. 20.36). She is, as are most of his women, dressed 
in satin, and Ter Borch was noted as an expert in recording this 
luxurious fabric. He did this by creating highly contrasting areas 
of light and dark, and by allowing the long satin skirts to reach 
the floor and buckle, creating even more shadows. The same 
dress is worn by another woman in a different painting by him, 


and these repeated patterns suggest that Ter Borch made drawings 
that he could use over again. The figures stand in a seemingly 
contemporary, but possibly imaginary, late seventeenth-century 
room, with a marble, four-column fireplace, and with a canopied 
bed in the background. There is a Turkish-carpeted table and a 
page, magnificently dressed. (Pages or messengers similarly 
dressed also appear in paintings by other contemporary artists.) 
The simplicity of the room accentuates the high fashion of the 
woman. Her maid adjusts her dress. The mirror set in a contem¬ 
porary gilt frame reflects the profile of the woman; in reality, she 
could not be seen from that angle. The theme of “at her toilet” 
can be seen in the work of Titian and Vouet (see figs. 17.35 
and 21.3), and even in Rembrandts Bathsheba with King 
David's Letter (see fig. 20.25), and the breathtaking beauty of 
Ter Borch s lady is reflected in all the trappings around her. The 
painting looks forward to the magnificence and opulence of the 
eighteenth century.

The Baroque in 
France and England 


D uring the course of the tumultuous seventeenth century, 

the great monarchies of France and England served as the greatest 
patrons of the arts. Expanding civic projects, notably in architecture, 
symbolized the wealth of each nation. France, led by an absolute ruler, 
and England, governed by a king who shared power with the Parliament, underwent 


dramatic change. Devastated by the previous era’s religious wars 
and dynastic struggles, both nations saw their treasuries sorely 
drained, their populations severely reduced, and their societies 
bitterly divided. The theological controversies that had character¬ 
ized the earlier Reformation and Counter-Reformation continued 
in this period, with Catholicism becoming the dominant religion 
in France (ever since the public conversion of Henry IV in 1593 
when he is reputed to have declared, “Paris is well worth a Mass”) 
and Protestantism in England (since the establishment of the 
Church of England under Henry VIII). Each successive French 
and English monarch sought to strike a delicate balance between 
these competing religious forces while attempting to favor the 
religion of his choice. The same was true throughout Europe, 
where isolated skirmishes eventually coalesced into a conflict that 
encompassed nearly all nations—the Thirty Years’ War (1618-48). 

England faced still more upheavals (map 21.1) and its situation 
degenerated in 1642 into a civil war that led to the trial of King 
Charles I, who was convicted of treason and beheaded in 1649. 
With the abolishment of the monarchy, the puritan Oliver 
Cromwell was named head of state and Lord Protector. Although 
he restored political stability, upon his death in 1658 his govern¬ 
ment foundered. Two years later, in 1660, Parliament offered the 
throne to the son of the beheaded king, Charles II (r. 1660-1685), 

Detail of figure 21.4, Nicolas Poussin, The Death ofGermanicus 


thus ushering in the period known as the Restoration. 
Unfortunately, old religious rivalries and economic crises per¬ 
sisted, and the reign of Charles II s successor, James II (r. 1685- 
1688), was soon in jeopardy. In the so-called Glorious Revolution 
of 1688, a relatively peaceful and bloodless event, members of the 
governing classes of Whigs and Tories proclaimed the prince of 
Orange, ruler of the Dutch Republic, as king of England; he 
reigned as William III from 1689 to 1702. The Bill of Rights 
(1689) established Parliaments supremacy, thus creating a unique 
form of government that would gradually influence nations world¬ 
wide, notably the British colonies in North America. 

Waging war was an expensive undertaking and sovereigns 
throughout Europe realized the pressing need to consolidate the 
state’s power and exert economic control. In France, which by 
midcentury had emerged as Europe’s most powerful nation both 
militarily and culturally, this centralization was most successfully 
implemented by Louis XIV (r. 1643-1715). Louis evoked the age- 
old Divine Right of Kings—the idea that the monarch received his 
authority directly from God. He used this to increase the state’s 
power over the nobility and over local authorities, amassing 
revenue through taxation. He relied on a form of royal govern¬ 
ment known as absolutism, which gave full power to the 
monarch. The absolute monarchy in France differed from 
England’s post-Restoration constitutional monarchy, which 
divided power between the ruler and other institutions. In his 
quest to assert the preeminence of France, Louis XIV embarked

CHAPTER 



Map 21 .1 Political resistance and unrest in France and England in the

on a series of military campaigns from 1688 to 1713 against his 
rivals, Spain, the Dutch Republic, Germany, and England. 
Despite eventual defeat, France remained a world power upon 
Louis s death in 1715. 

The wars and social turmoil took perhaps their harshest toll 
on peasants and commoners, who reeled from continually 
increasing taxes as well as from devastating natural disasters and 
the ensuing food shortages, famine, and rising prices. Yet despite 
the abject poverty endured by some members of society, others 
enjoyed new wealth and prosperity. Both England and France 
reaped enormous profits from investments in their colonial 
empires, and established trade routes that delivered a wider range 
of goods and enhanced the lifestyles of many Europeans. The 
development of mercantilism and a worldwide marketplace 
brought about the rise of a class of increasingly wealthy urban 
merchants seeking art to furnish and decorate their homes. 

Classicism is the style now associated with the art of these 
two nations. Through its use of a Classical vocabulary—from 
columns, capitals, and pediments in architecture to styles of dress 
in painting—it draws on the example of the ancient world to 
suggest authority order, and enduring tradition by evoking the 


imperial grandeur of Rome. Although the Mannerist style of 
the later School of Fontainebleau persisted in France until about 
1625 (see page 629), classicism soon became the hallmark of 
seventeenth-century French art. It was the official court style 
of painting between 1660 and 1685, the climactic phase of Louis 
XIV s reign. Classical principles also dominated architecture, with 
the new Louvre and Versailles palaces representing the most 
visible accomplishments in France. 

In England, too, classicism dominated art and architecture, 
notably the hospitals, churches, and country houses designed by 
Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren. In the wake of the Great 
Fire of London in 1666, architecture thrived as massive recon¬ 
struction projects were undertaken to rebuild the city. Yet 
England’s most lasting artistic successes in the seventeenth 
century were in literature, including the works of William 
Shakespeare, John Donne, and John Milton as well as the royal 
committee’s translation of what would become known as the 
King James Bible. 

FRANCE: THE STYLE OF LOUIS XIV 

By the late seventeenth century Paris was vying with Rome to 
become Europe’s art center. The French kings Henry IV 
(r. 1589-1610), Louis XIII (r. 1610-1643), and Louis XIV (r. 
1643-1715)—aided by ambitious and able ministers and advisors 
such as the due de Sully cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, and 
Jean-Baptiste Colbert—created the climate for this exciting turn 
of events. The rulers and their officials recognized the power of 
art to convey the majesty and strength of the monarchy and they 
set out on a massive program of patronage of all the arts and 
sciences—painting, sculpture, architecture, landscape design, 
decorative arts, theoretical and applied science, philosophy and 
literature. Louis XIV especially manipulated art to serve as prop¬ 
aganda for his absolutist policies. He adopted the symbolic 
imagery of the sun as well as the Greek god of the sun, Apollo, 
and came to be called the Sun King. This symbolism provided an 
ancient lineage for Louis and his status as absolute ruler. The ideal 
of gloire (glory), seen in the portraits and architecture he commis¬ 
sioned, reflected his desire to give concrete form to the majesty of 
his rule, and of France too. 

Because the Palace of Versailles (see figs. 21.12-21.15) and 
other vast building projects glorified the French king, we are 
tempted to think of French art in the age of Louis XIV as merely 
an expression of absolute rule. This perception perhaps holds true 
for the period 1660-85, but by that time seventeenth-century 
French painting and sculpture had already attained their distinc¬ 
tive Classical character. French historians are reluctant to call 
this style Baroque but refer to it instead as the “Style of Louis 
XIV” (art created during his reign). They also use this term to 
describe art created prior to Louis XIV, particularly that produced 
at the court of his father, Louis XIII. In addition, scholars often 
describe the period’s art and literature as “classic.” In this context, 
the word has three meanings. It is a synonym for “highest 


738 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 










achievement,” which suggests that the Style of Louis XIV is 
the equivalent of the High Renaissance in Italy or the age of 
Perikles in ancient Greece. It also refers to the imitation of the 
forms and subject matter of Classical antiquity. Finally, it suggests 
qualities of balance and restraint shared by ancient art and the 
Renaissance. The last two meanings describe what could more 
accurately be called Classicism. Because the Style of Louis XIV 
reflects Italian Baroque art, although in modified form, we may 
call it Baroque Classicism. 

Painting and Printmaking in France 

The many foreign artists working in France drew inspiration 
from that country’s styles and traditions, whereas French artists 
often traveled to Italy and the Netherlands to work. In the 
hopes of creating a nucleus of artists who would shape the 
Baroque style in France, Louis XIII began to recall these artists to 
Paris. That is, French artists who were abroad were then required 
to come home. Among the summoned artists were painters 
Nicolas Poussin and Simon Vouet, who had been working in 
Rome, and the printmaker Jacques Callot, who returned from 
Florence to his home in northern France. The influences of 
foreign artists were significant. 

JACQUES CALLOT: a TRANSITIONAL FIGURE One of 

the most important early seventeenth-century artists was Jacques 
Callot (1592/93-1635), an etcher and engraver whose small-scale 
prints recording actual events inspired his compatriot Georges de 
La Tour (discussed below) and the young Rembrandt (see page 
718). Callots exploitation of the mediums ability to produce 
stark tonal contrasts and intricate details reflects the tradition, 
dating from the fifteenth century, of using mass-produced prints 
to disseminate information. Yet his poignant representations of 
contemporary figures and events places him firmly in the art 
of his own time. Callot spent much of his early career at the court 


of Cosimo II de’ Medici in Florence, where he produced prints 
inspired primarily by the theater and especially the commedia 
delTarte. After returning to his native town of Nancy in 1621, he 
began to concentrate almost exclusively on the technique of etch¬ 
ing and the subject of his work changed. He visited Breda in 1626, 
soon after the surrender of Dutch troops there (see fig. 19.36), and 
executed six plates showing a large panorama of the site. 

Callot s insight into the personal and political geography of 
battle can best be seen in the series The Great Miseries of War, 
which represents a distillation of his experience of the Thirty 
Years’ War. (Scholars once thought Callot executed the series in 
1633 but now consider it to be from 1629-32.) In the 18 etchings 
in the series, Callot reveals the misery, destruction, and poverty 
brought by the invading army. Several prints are devoted to sol¬ 
diers’ crimes, whereas others, including Hangman's Tree (fig. 
21.1), focus on the punishments dealt out to the French army for 
their own excesses. The inscription at the bottom reads: “Finally 
these thieves, sordid and forlorn, hanging like unfortunate pieces 
of fruit from this tree, experience the justice of Heaven sooner 
or later.” Despite the work’s small size (it measures only a few 
inches), nearly 50 figures inhabit the scene. The awkward per¬ 
spective emphasizes the tiny, elongated, Mannerist-style figures; 
in the figures on the right, however, Callot shows a naturalism in 
costume and attitude that is characteristic of the new Baroque 
style. The bleak scene is as disturbing as Hieronymus Bosch’s 
vision of Hell in The Garden of Earthly Delights (see fig. 14.22); 
indeed, it may be even more so, for it is based on the artist’s own 
experience of the horrors of war. 

GEORGES DE LA TOUR AND THE INFLUENCE OF 
CARAVAGGIO Many French painters in the early seventeenth 
century were influenced by Caravaggio, although how they came 
to be exposed to the Italian artist’s style remains unclear. Besides 
being named a painter to King Louis XIII, Georges de La Tour 
(1593-1652) received important commissions from the governor

of Lorraine, his hometown in northeast France. His use of light 
and his reliance on detailed naturalism derived largely from 
Caravaggio s northern European followers (see page 664), whom 
he may have visited in the Dutch Republic. 

La Tours mature religious pictures effectively convey the 
complex mysteries of the Christian faith. With its carefully 
observed details and seemingly humble subject, Joseph the 
Carpenter (fig. 21.2) might initially be mistaken for a genre scene, 
but its devotional spirit soon overwhelms us. The two figures are 
set in profile, thus yielding little by their expressions. La Tour 
lends maximum significance to each gesture, each look. The boy 
Jesus holds a candle, a favorite device of the artist, whose flame 
reinforces the devotional mood and imbues the scene with inti¬ 
macy and tenderness. The painting has the power of Caravaggio s 
The Calling of St. Matthew (see fig. 19.2), but the simplified forms, 
warm palette, and arrested movement are characteristic of La 
Tours restrained and focused vision. 

SIMON VOUET AND THE DECORATIVE STYLE Although 
Simon Vouet (1590-1649) may be little known today, he was the 
most important French painter in the first third of the seventeenth 
century. He was the leader of the French Caravaggesque painters 


in Rome, although he painted in many styles throughout his 
career. At an early age he accompanied his artist father to England 
and Constantinople, but his most significant foreign journey took 
him to Rome, where he lived from 1613 to 1627. There, he became 
an adherent of Caravaggio s style but was also later influenced 
by the Bolognese artist Annibale Carracci. Vouet was so well 
respected that he was elected president of the Academy of 
St. Luke in Rome. Officially recalled to France in 1627 by Louis 
XIII, he settled in Paris and became the leading painter of his day. 
Vouet quickly shed all traces of Caravaggio s manner and devel¬ 
oped a colorful style, which won such acclaim that he was named 
first painter to the king. It is from Vouet s studio that the official 
style in France emanated in the 1630s and 1640s. His paintings, 
influenced by Venetian artists, were known for their rich colors 
and use of light and thus provided the interiors of royal residences 
and a growing number of French aristocratic houses with a new 
vibrant decorative style. 

The Toilet of Venus (fig. 21.3), possibly painted for one of the 
kings mistresses, is one of several on this theme that Vouet

executed. It depicts a subject popular in Venice, notably treated 
by Titian and Veronese, and also by Rubens (compare also the 
introspective toilet scene of Bathsheba by Rembrandt, see fig. 
20.25). Vouet s central figure recalls Correggio s Jupiter and Io 
(see fig. 17.26) but lacks that works frank eroticism. Instead, 
Vouet has imbued his Venus with an elegant sensuousness that is 
uniquely French. The continuous swirling circles, near-nudity, 
interest in fabric, and luminous colors only suggest the erotic, 
whose appeal would continue well into the eighteenth century 
and provide the basis for the Rococo style in painting. Vouet 
taught the next generation of artists, including those who worked 
on Louis XIV s palace at Versailles, the landscape designer and 
royal gardener Andre Le Notre, and Charles Le Brun, the royal 
painter who would later establish the French Royal Academy 
(from which he would exclude his teacher). 

NICOLAS POUSSIN AND BAROQUE CLASSICISM Despite 
Vouet s earlier influence on painting, after the 1640s Classicism 
reigned supreme in France. The artist who contributed most to its 
rise was Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), one of the most influential 
French painters of the century. Aside from an ill-fated two-year 
sojourn in Paris (he was “recalled” there by Louis XIII), Poussin 
spent his entire career in Rome. There, he hosted and taught 
visiting French artists, absorbing the lessons of Raphael s and 
Carracci s classically ordered paintings and developing his own 
style of rational classicism. Patrons brought Poussin s paintings 
back to Paris, where they influenced the royal court. Indeed, 


when establishing the curriculum of the French Royal Academy 
in the 1660s, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the kings chief advisor, and 
Charles Le Brun chose Poussin s classical style to serve as a model 
for French artists. 

POUSSIN AND HISTORY PAINTING: ANCIENT THEMES 
IN THE GRAND MANNER Arriving in Rome via Venice in 
early 1624, Poussin studied perspective and anatomy and exam¬ 
ined ancient sculpture, such as the Laocoon (see page 183), the 
Belvedere Torso , and the Apollo Belvedere , the reliefs on ancient 
sarcophagi and vases, and the paintings of Raphael. His The 
Death ofGermanicus (fig. 21.4 and page 736) reflects these stud¬ 
ies. The work served as a model for artistic depictions of heroic 
deathbed scenes for the next two centuries and may in fact be the 
first example of this subject in the history of art. In some respects 
a typical history painting, the work relates the powerful themes of 
death, loyalty, and revenge. The story comes from Tacitus and is 
set in the year 19 CE. Germanicus was a Roman general who had 
led campaigns against the Germanic tribes. At the urging of 
Tiberius, Germanicus’ adoptive father, the ruler in Syria, poisoned 
the powerful general. Poussin depicts Germanicus on his 
deathbed; on the left his loyal soldiers are swearing revenge and 
on the right his mournful family weeps. The promise to avenge is 
set at the center, commanding attention, as figures gesture their 
grief, loyalty, and suffering. Framed by the two groups, 
Germanicus becomes the focus of the composition, which is 
based on antique scenes of the death of Meleager (see fig. 7.69).

CHAPTER 21 THE BAROQUE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND 741 







OURCE 


Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) 



From an undated manuscript 

Poussin's ideas on art were central to the formation of the French 
Academy in 1648 and, because of the preeminence of that body, to the 
entire European academic movement of the seventeenth through the 
nineteenth centuries. 



T he magnificent manner consists of four things: subject, or topic, 
concept, structure and style. The first requirement, which is the 
basis for all the others, is that the subject or topic should be great, 
such as battles, heroic actions and divine matters. However, given the 
subject upon which the painter is engaged is great, he must first of all 
make every effort to avoid getting lost in minute detail, so as not to 
detract from the dignity of the story. He should describe the magnif¬ 
icent and great details with a bold brush and disregard anything that 
is vulgar and of little substance. Thus the painter should not only be 


skilled in formulating his subject matter, but wise enough to know it 
well and to choose something that lends itself naturally to embellish¬ 
ment and perfection. Those who choose vile topics take refuge in 
them on account of their own lack of ingenuity. Faintheartedness is 
therefore to be despised, as is baseness of subject matter for which 
any amount of artifice is useless. As for the concept, it is simply part 
of the spirit, which concentrates on things, like the concept realized 
by Homer and Phidias of Olympian Zeus who could make the 
Universe tremble with a nod of his head. The drawing of things 
should be such that it expresses the concept of the things themselves. 
The structure, or composition of the parts, should not be studiously 
researched, and not sought after or contrived with effort but should 
be as natural as possible. Style is a particular method of painting and 
drawing, carried out in an individual way, born of the singular talent 
at work in its application and in the use of ideas. This style, and the 
manner and taste emanate from nature and from the mind.

The architecture sets the stage for the figures, which are arranged 
horizontally in a rectangular space, as in a Classical frieze. The 
curtain in the rear restricts the action to a shallow space, height¬ 
ening the drama and creating a more intimate environment. 

This early work by Poussin, painted just a few years after he 
arrived in Rome, was probably created for Cardinal Francesco 
Barberinis secretary, Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657), a major 


patron of the arts. Its composition, setting, and heroic historical 
subject (see Primary Source , above), are typical of Poussins 
classicism and his concept of the Grand Manner. 

THE ABDUCTION OF THE SABINE WOMEN Demonstrating 
Poussin s allegiance to classicism, The Abduction of the Sabine 
Women (fig. 21.5) displays the severe discipline of his intellectual

style, which developed in response to what he regarded as the 
excesses of the High Baroque. The strongly modeled figures are 
"frozen in action,” like statues. Many are, in fact, derived from 
Hellenistic sculpture, but the main group is directly inspired by 
Giovanni Bolognas The Rape of the Sabine Woman (see fig. 
17.13). Poussin has placed them before reconstructions of Roman 
architecture that he believed to be archaeologically correct. 

Poussin thought the highest aim of painting was to represent 
noble and serious human actions. Emotion is abundantly dis¬ 
played in the dramatic poses and expressions of the figures here, 
but there is a lack of spontaneity that perhaps causes it to fail to 
touch us. In part, this is due to their derivation from sculpture. 
The scene has a theatrical air, and for good reason. Before begin¬ 
ning the painting, Poussin, besides making preliminary drawings, 
arranged wax figurines on a miniature stage until he was satisfied 
with the composition. 

Poussin believed that the viewer must be able to "read” the 
emotions of each figure as they related to the story. Such beliefs 
later proved influential to his student Charles Le Brun when 
establishing an approved court style for French painting. These 
ideas were not really new. We recall Horaces motto Ut pictura 
poesis ("As is painting, so is poetry”), and Leonardo s statement 
that the highest aim of painting is to depict "the intention of man’s 
soul” (see page 564). Before Poussin, however, no artist had made 
the analogy between painting and literature so closely or put it 
into practice so singlemindedly. 

The historical event portrayed in The Abduction of the Sabine 
Women was admired as an act of patriotism ensuring the future of 
Rome. According to the accounts of Livy and Plutarch, the 
Sabines were young women abducted by the Romans to become 
their wives; the women later acted as peacemakers between the 
two opposing sides. Clearly, in the painting the women do not go 
willingly as swords are drawn, babies are abandoned, and the eld¬ 
erly suffer. But Poussin s apparent detachment and lack of sympa¬ 
thy for those suffering has caused the work to be labeled "heroic. ” 
His work appeals to the mind, that is, to the larger view of history, 
rather than to the senses. Poussin suppresses color and instead 
stresses form and composition. 

This method accounts for the visual rhetoric in The Abduction 
of the Sabine Women that makes the picture seem so remote. This 
preliminary drawing (fig. 21.6) (made in fact for a different 
version of the painting) suggests how deliberate the artists 
process was. Using pen and ink and wash, Poussin worked out 
many of his compositions beforehand, as did Rubens. We have 
already mentioned his employment of wax figurines. In this 
drawn example, he placed figures in the foreground and ancient 
architecture as a stage set in the background. Such studies 
con-trast sharply with the methods of Caravaggio and the Cara- 
vaggisti, who supported painting "from nature,” that is, from 
living models and without the aid of preparatory drawings. 
Poussin, on the other hand, regarded history painting as more 
intellectual and as derived from the imagination; he reportedly 
told a contemporary that "Caravaggio had come into the world to 
destroy painting. ”

POUSSIN AND THE IDEAL LANDSCAPE The "ideal” land¬ 
scape, serene and balanced, does not represent a particular locale 
but rather a generalized and often beautiful place. Poussin s ideal 
landscape is the opposite of those of his Dutch contemporaries 
(Van Goyen and Ruisdael, see figs. 20.27-20.29) and their 
topographical views. Indeed, because figures play only a minor 
role in landscapes, it is surprising that Poussin chose to explore 
this subject at all. The austere beauty and somber calm of 
Poussin s work can be seen in his Landscape with St. John on 
Patmos (fig. 21.7), which continues the Classical landscape tradi¬ 
tion of Annibale Carracci; with this work, Poussin is considered 
to have invented the ideal landscape. The brilliantly lit, ancient 
landscape strewn with architectural ruins suggests both the actual 
site and the concept of antiquity upon which early Christianity 
was founded. Trees on either side balance the composition, and 
many of the ruins are set parallel to the picture plane. A reclining 
St. John, who at the end of his life lived on the island of Patmos, 
reportedly in somewhat abject circumstances, is shown in profile 
facing left. Poussin s pendant (paired) painting, Landscape with St. 
Matthew , shows that saint facing right, yet the works were cre¬ 
ated independently. Poussin may have conceived the project as 
four paintings of the four Evangelists; if so, those featuring St. 
Luke and St. Mark were never executed. Both known paintings 
were made in Rome for the secretary to Pope Urban VIII. The 
composition suggests the physical, rational arrangement of a spir¬ 
itual, eternal, ideal world—a concept well suited to and best 
explored by Baroque Classicism. Poussins mythological land¬ 
scapes show a similar blend of the physical, rational, and mythic. 

CLAUDE LORRAIN AND THE IDYLLIC LANDSCAPE While 
Poussin developed the heroic qualities of the ideal landscape, the 
great French landscapist Claude Lorrain (Claude Gellee, also 
called Claude; 1604/05?-1682) brought its idyllic aspects of both

landscapes and seascapes. He, too, spent nearly his entire career 
in Rome, beginning as a pastry chef. From 1625 to 1627, however, 
he returned briefly to Nancy, where he was familiar with fellow 
resident Jacques Callot. He later copied Callot s etchings from 
The Great Miseries ofWar series (see fig. 21.1). Claude s family in 
Nancy had been victims of the Thirty Years’ War and so the series 
may have had a particularly personal meaning for him. While in 
Rome, Claude worked with several artists and was a pupil and 
assistant to Agostino Tassi (see fig. 19.10). Like many northern 
Europeans, Claude thoroughly explored the surrounding coun¬ 
tryside, the campagna , of Rome and his countless drawings made 
on site reveal his powers of observation. He is also the first artist 
known to have painted oil studies outdoors. Such sketches, how¬ 
ever, were only the raw material for his landscapes. To guard 
against forgeries, about 1635 Claude began making drawings of 
his paintings, which he kept as a record in a book known as Liber 
Veritatis (The Book of Truth). (See The Art Historian's Lens , page 
747.) It is from annotations made on the backs of these drawings 
that we have learned the subjects of his paintings known as 


“pastorals,” a literary genre that flourished in Venice in the six¬ 
teenth century in works by painters such as Giorgione and Titian 
(see figs. 16.29 and 16.30). 

Claudes themes are often historical or pastoral, as in A 
Pastoral Landscape (fig. 21.8). He does not aim for topographic 
accuracy in his paintings but instead evokes the poetic essence of 
a countryside filled with echoes of antiquity. Many of Claude s 
paintings are visual narratives drawn from ancient texts, such as 
the epic tales and poetry of Vergil. Often, as in this painting, the 
compositions have the hazy, luminous atmosphere of early morn¬ 
ing or late afternoon. One can refer to Claude as painting “into 
the light. ” That is, his sunlight (often sunsets) is at the center and 
at the horizon line of the painting so that the architecture and 
other elements in the foreground or middleground appear almost 
as silhouettes. This example is painted on copper, a material sev¬ 
enteenth-century artists frequently employed for small works. 
The surfaces of copper paintings are luminous. Here, the space 
expands serenely rather than receding step by step as in works 
by Poussin. An air of nostalgia, of past experience enhanced by 


744 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 






memory, imbues the scene. It is this nostalgic mood founded in 
ancient literature that forms its subject. 

Claude succeeded in elevating the landscape genre, which had 
traditionally been accorded only a very low status. Prevailing 
artistic theory had ranked the rendering of common nature at the 
bottom of the hierarchy of painting genres, with landscape only 
just above still life. Claude, encouraged by sophisticated patrons, 
progressively moved away from showing the daily activity of life 
at the ports, and embellished his seascapes and landscapes with 
historical, biblical, and mythological subjects, thereby raising the 
status of the genre. 

CHARLES LE BRUN AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
ROYAL ACADEMY In art as in life, the French monarchy sought 
to maintain strict control, and thus the Royal Academy of Painting 
and Sculpture was founded in Paris in 1648. One of the 12 found¬ 
ing members was artist Charles Le Brun (1619-1690), who helped 
reorganize the academy in the 1660s into a formal institution. 


Although it came to be associated with the absolutism of Louis 
XIV s reign, at its inception the king was only ten years old, his 
mother Anne was regent, and Cardinal Mazarin effectively con¬ 
trolled affairs of state. Yet the ideology of academy and throne 
would increasingly coincide and strengthen each other in the 
ensuing years. 

When Louis XIV assumed control of the government in 1661, 
Jean-Baptiste Colbert, his chief advisor, began to build an admin¬ 
istrative apparatus capable of supporting the power of the 
absolute monarch. In this system, aimed at controlling the 
thoughts and actions of the nation, the task of the visual arts was 
to glorify the king. As in music and theater, which shared the 
same purpose, the official “royal style” was Classicism. 
Centralized control over the visual arts was exerted by Colbert 
and Le Brun, who became supervisor of all the king s artistic proj¬ 
ects. As chief dispenser of royal artistic patronage, Le Brun s 
power was so great that for all practical purposes he acted as 
dictator of the arts in France.

Upon becoming the academy’s director in 1663, Le Brun 
established a rigid curriculum of practical and theoretical instruc¬ 
tion. He lectured extensively at the academy; several lectures were 
devoted to examining the art of Poussin, venerating the works of 
Raphael, and studying physiognomy (facial expressions). 
Probably about 1668, he codified facial expressions in a series of 
annotated drawings published posthumously as engravings (fig. 
21.9). His lectures documented the movements of eyes, eyebrows, 
and mouths to show passions and emotions such as fear, anger, 
and surprise, corresponding to those described in the Passions of 
the Soul , published in 1649 by Descartes. Le B run’s schemata were 
intended to be used as formulas by artists to establish narratives 
in their paintings that could be easily “read” by viewers. 

Much of Le Bruns doctrine was derived from Poussin, with 
whom he had studied for several years in Rome. The academy 
also devised a method for assigning numerical grades to artists 
past and present in such categories as drawing, expression, and 
proportion. The ancients received the highest marks, followed by 
Raphael and his school, and then Poussin. Venetian artists, who 
“overemphasized” color, ranked low, while the Flemish and 
Dutch were placed lower still. Subjects were also classified: At the 
top was history (that is, narrative subjects, whether Classical, 
biblical, or mythological) and at the bottom was still life, with 
portraiture falling in between. 

HYACINTHE RICAUD AND THE SPLENDOR OF LOUIS XIV 

The monumental Portrait of Louis XIV (fig. 21.10) by Hyacinthe 
Rigaud (1659-1743) conveys the power, drama, and splendor of 
the absolutist ruler. The king is shown life-size and full-length, 
much like Charles I in Van Dycks portrait (see fig. 20.8). The 
resemblance is intentional, and the work follows the formulaic 
nature of royal portraiture of the time to espouse power and 
authority through the use of the insignias of rulership and the 
symbols of the opulence of the monarch’s reign. Louis is shown

A rt forgery—the deliberate copying or cre¬ 
ation of a work of art without permission 
and with the intention to deceive—has long 
posed a serious threat to both artists and collec¬ 
tors. Art forgers have targeted jewelry, sculp¬ 
ture, painting, and prints, usually in the hopes of 
selling their fakes for personal gain. 

Forgers may copy the works or styles of artists 
from either the past or present. In ancient times, 
reports surfaced of forgeries being made of the 
works of Myron and Praxiteles (see Chapter 5). 

We know, too, that Michelangelo made “antique” 
forgeries by burying sculpture to produce a 
patina imitating the effects of time and wear. To 
create the look of an older product, forgers may 
use materials such as old paper, homemade 
paints, previously used canvases, and wood that 
has been peppered with buckshot to resemble 
aged wood infested with wormholes. 

Not only are artists deprived of monetary com¬ 
pensation by a forgery, but their reputation can 
also be jeopardized by art of lesser quality being 
passed off as theirs. Such was the case with 
Albrecht Durer (see Chapter 1 8), who discovered 
upon his visit to Venice in 1506 that the well- 
known printmaker Marcantonio Raimondi (ca. 

1 480-ca. 1 527) was selling engravings that he had created in the 
manner of Durer’s woodcuts and bearing Durer’s monogram. Durer 
sued, and although Raimondi was allowed to continue producing the 
engravings, he could no longer include Durer’s signature on them. 

Claude Lorrain experienced a similar problem, for which he devel¬ 
oped a unique solution. We know from the writer Filippo Baldinucci 
(1 625-1 697) that Claude discovered that another artist, Sebastien 
Bourdon (1 61 6-1 671), was adept at imitating the light and tonal 
effects in Claude’s paintings. In fact, Bourdon’s skill in producing them 
was so great that, after visiting Claude’s studio, he painted a land¬ 
scape and sold it as a work purportedly by Claude. Other artists also 
found it easy to imitate Claude’s techniques and compositions. 

To safeguard against any such dishonest practices, around 1 635 
Claude decided to compile the Liber Veritatis (The Book of Truth), an 
album of drawings reproducing all of his paintings from that time on. 
On the verso, or back, he annotated each drawing with the name of the 
patron, buyer, or place to which the work was sent; he sometimes 
included the date and a reference to the work’s subject as well. 
Collectors could consult the book and verify whether a painting was 
included—and thus foil any potential forger. 

By the time of his death, Claude had made drawings of 1 95 of his 
paintings. He did not record paintings made before 1 635, and there¬ 
fore an estimated 50 works are missing from the album. Claude was a 
prolific draftsman—over 1,200 drawings by him are known, although 
the album records only drawings of his finished paintings (see 
Claude’s drawing of A Storm off the Coast, above). The Liber Veritatis, 


nowin the collection of the British Museum, consists of sheets meas¬ 
uring 7 u / 6 by 1 O’/iriches (1 95 x 260 mm) that are organized in groups 
of four white sheets alternating with four blue ones. Scholars have 
speculated that Claude chose these paper colors to reflect the light 
effects in his paintings. It also suggests that he probably did not exe¬ 
cute the drawings in chronological order. To create them, he used pen 
and ink with brown and sometimes gray washes. He added highlights 
with white chalk and touches of gold. Such time-consuming details, 
especially evident in the book’s later drawings, show that Claude 
began to use the album not just to reproduce paintings but also to 
create elaborate, finished drawings that stand on their own as accom¬ 
plished works of art. 

Dealers and collectors today often rely on a comparable type of 
book called a catalogue raisonne. Compiled by an expert after years 
of meticulous research, this publication describes and illustrates all 
the known, verified, and some attributed (but nonauthenticated) works 
by a particular artist as well as pertinent information about each 
object’s dimensions, condition, and provenance (history of owner¬ 
ship). But perhaps most important in the fight against forgeries is the 
wide range of available technologies—from carbon dating to infrared 
spectroscopy—to analyze and date a work’s materials and stages of 
creation. Still, even with these advanced detection methods, not all 
experts agree about the authenticity of a given work since these tech¬ 
nologies can often only verify the time or place a work was produced 
and not the artist’s hand. For that we still rely on connoisseurship and 
the experience and expertise of the art historian.

draped with his velvet coronation robes lined with ermine and 
trimmed with gold fleurs-de-lis. He appears self-assured, power¬ 
ful, majestic—and also tall, an illusion created by the artist, for his 
subject actually measured only 5 feet 4 inches. The portrait 
proudly displays the king’s shapely legs (emphasized by the high 
heels Louis himself designed to increase his height), which were 
his pride and joy as a dancer. Indeed, the king actively participated 
in the ballets of Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687) from the 1650s 
until his coronation. All the arts, from the visual arts to the 
performing arts, fell under royal control—a fact exemplified in 
Rigaud’s painting, which expresses Louiss dominance and 
unequaled stature as the center of the French state. 

French Classical Architecture 

Because they were large, ostentatious, and public, building proj¬ 
ects, even more than paintings, transmitted the values of the royal 
court to a wide audience. In French architecture, the Classical 
style expressed the grandeur and authority of imperial Rome and 
confirmed the ideals of tradition, omnipotence, absolutism, 
strength, and permanence espoused by the monarchy. Mammoth 
scale and repetition of forms evoke these broad concepts, which 
were embodied in royal structures erected in the heart of Paris as 
well as outside the city, in the palace and gardens at Versailles. 

In 1655, Louis XIV declared: “L’etat, c 3 est moi” (“I am the 
state”). This statement was not just political but represented an 


artistic and aesthetic idea as well. Louis’s projects for his palace 
and court took on colossal proportions and represented not a 
single individual, or even a single monarch, but the entirety of 
France. He began by renovating the Louvre, a project begun by 
his father, but that proved insufficient. Louis wanted to move his 
entire royal court to a more isolated location where he could con¬ 
trol them more efficiently, and so he began construction on the 
palace and gardens at Versailles, located a few miles outside Paris. 
These complex building projects all share a single style—that of 
Baroque Classicism. 

THE LOUVRE Work on the palace had proceeded intermittently 
for more than a century, following Pierre Lescot’s original design 
under Francis I; what remained was to close the square court on 
the east side with an impressive facade. Colbert was dissatisfied 
with the proposals of French architects including Francois 
Mansart (1598-1666), who submitted designs not long before his 
death. Colbert then invited Bernini to Paris in the hope that the 
most famous artist of the Roman Baroque would do for the 
French king what he had done for the popes in Italy. Bernini spent 
several months in Paris in 1665 and submitted three innovative 
designs on a scale that would have dwarfed the existing palace. 
After much argument and intrigue, Louis XIV rejected them and 
turned the problem over to a committee: Charles Le Brun, his 
court painter; Louis Le Vau (1612-1670), his court architect who 
had already done much work on the Louvre (including the

Gallery of Apollo, the Queen s Court, and the south facade); and 
Claude Perrault (1613-1688), an anatomist and student of ancient 
architecture. All three men were responsible for the structure of 
the new Louvre (fig. 21.11), but Perrault is rightly credited with 
the major share. Certainly his detractors at the time thought so, 
and he was often called upon to defend his design. 

Perrault based the center pavilion on a Roman temple front, 
and the wings look like the sides of a temple folded outward. The 
colonnade was controversial because of its use of paired columns, 
but this treatment quickly became a characteristic of French 
Classicism in architecture. 

The east front of the Louvre signaled the victory of French 
Classicism over the Italian Baroque as the royal style. It further 
proclaimed France as the new Rome, both politically and cultur¬ 
ally, by linking Louis XIV with the glory of the Caesars. This 
revitalization of the antique, both in its conception and its details, 
was Perrault s main contribution. 

Claude Perrault owed his position to his brother Charles 
(1628-1703), who, as Colberts master of buildings under Louis 


XIV, had helped undermine Bernini during his stay at the 
French court. It is likely that Claude Perrault shared the views 
set forth some 20 years later in his brother s Parallels Between 
the Ancients and Moderns in which Charles claimed that 
“Homer and Vergil made countless mistakes which the moderns 
no longer make [because] the ancients did not have all our 
rules.” The Louvres east front presents not simply a Classical 
revival but a vigorous distillation of what Claude Perrault 
considered to be the eternal ideals of beauty, intended to 
surpass anything built by the Romans themselves. Indeed, 
Perrault annotated Vitruvius and wrote his own treatise on the 
Classical orders. 

THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES Louis XIVs largest enter¬ 
prise was the Palace of Versailles (fig. 21 . 12 ), located 11 miles 
(18 km) from the center of Paris. By forcing the aristocracy to live 
under royal scrutiny outside Paris, the king hoped to prevent a 
repeat of the civil rebellion known as the Fronde, which had 
occurred during his minority in 1648-53.

decoration), and Antoine Coysevox (for the relief, The Triumph of Louis 
XTV). Salon de la Guerre (Salon of War), Palace of Versailles. Begun 1678 


The project was begun in 1669 by Le Vau, who designed the 
elevation of the garden front (fig. 21.13); within a year of doing so 
he had died. Under the leadership of Jules Hardouin-Mansart 
(1646-1708), the structure was greatly expanded to accommodate 
the ever-growing royal household. The garden front, intended by 
Le Vau to be the main view of the palace, was stretched to an 
enormous length but with no change in the architectural elements. 
As a result, Le Vau s original facade design, a less severe variant of 
the Louvre s east front, now looks repetitious and out of scale. 
The center block contains a single room measuring 240 feet in 
length, the spectacular Galerie des Glaces, or Hall of Mirrors (fig. 
21.14). At either end are the Salon de la Guerre (Salon of War) and 
its counterpart, the Salon de la Paix (Salon of Peace). The sump¬ 
tuous effect of the Galerie des Glaces recalls the gallery of Francis 
I at Fontainebleau, but the use of full-length mirrors was unique: 
They represented a great investment on the part of the monarchy. 
The art of large mirror-making was invented in Venice and 
brought to France by agents of Colbert. Such extravagant details 
were meant to reinforce the majesty of both Louis’s reign and of 
France. The mirrors were placed in such a way as to reflect the 
gardens outside, making the room appear larger by day At night, 
myriad reflections of candlelight illuminated the grand space. 
Whether by day or by night, the effect was impressive. 

Baroque features, although not officially acknowledged by the 
architects, appeared inside the palace. This shift reflected the 
king s own taste. Louis XIV was interested less in architectural 
theory and monumental Classical exteriors than in the lavish inte¬ 
riors that would provide suitable settings for himself and his 
court. Thus, the man to whom he listened most often was not an 
architect but the painter Charles Le Brun, whose goal was to sub¬ 
ordinate all the arts to the expression of the king s power. To 
achieve this aim, he drew freely on his memories of Rome; the 
great decorative schemes of the Italian Baroque must have 
impressed him. Although a disciple of Poussin, Le Brun had stud¬ 
ied first with Vouet and became a superb decorator. At Versailles, 
he employed architects, sculptors, painters, and decorators to 
produce ensembles of unprecedented splendor. The Salon de la 
Guerre (fig. 21.15), which includes a relief of The Triumph of 
Louis XIV by Antoine Coysevox (see page 753), is close in many 
ways to the theatricality and variety of mediums of Bernini s 
Cornaro Chapel (see fig. 19.31). Although Le Bruns ensemble is 
less adventurous than Bernini s, he has given greater emphasis to 
surface decoration. As in many Italian Baroque interiors, the sep¬ 
arate components are less impressive than the effect of the whole. 

THE GARDENS AT VERSAILLES Apart from its magnificent 
interior, the most impressive aspect of Versailles is its park 
designed by Andre Le Notre (1613-1700), who had become 
director of the gardens of Louis XIII in 1643 and whose family 
had served as royal gardeners for generations. Versailles and its 
gardens are vast: The completed palace and park covers almost 
18,000 acres (the wall around it is 27 miles long). The type of 
formal gardens found at Versailles had their beginnings in 
Renaissance Florence but had never been attempted on the scale 


achieved by Le Notre, who transformed an entire natural forest 
into a controlled park, a massive and expensive enterprise that 
reflected the grandeur of the king. The park follows its Grand 
Axis from east to west, intended to imply the course of the sun as 
it rises in the east over the king (the Sun King) in the palace and 
sets in the west at the farthest end of the gardens. Conceptually 
the landscape is as significant as the palace—perhaps more so, for 
it suggests the king s dominion over nature. The landscape design 
is so strictly correlated with the plan of the palace that it in effect 
continues the architectural space. Like the interiors, the formal 
gardens were meant to provide a suitable setting for the king s 
public appearances. They form a series of “outdoor rooms” for 
the splendid fetes and spectacles that were an integral part of 
Louis s court. 

The spirit of absolutism is apparent in Le Notre s plan, which 
called for the taming of nature: Forests were thinned to create 
stately avenues, plants were shaped into manicured hedges, water 
was pumped into exuberant fountains and serene lakes. The for¬ 
mal gardens consist of a multitude of paths, terraces, basins, 
mazes, and parterres (designed flower beds) that create a unified 
geometric whole. Farther from the palace, the plan becomes less 
formal and incorporates the site s densely wooded areas and open 
meadows. Throughout, carefully planned vistas give rise to visual 
surprises. An especially important aspect of the landscape design 


CHAPTER 21 THE BAROQUE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND 751 










was the program of sculpture, much of which incorporated 
images of Apollo, the sun-god, a favorite symbol of Louis XIV. 

Versailles was called by a contemporary “pure harmony. 
Everything there is part of the unity of a perfect work of art. ” But 
the elaborate and expansive gardens had their detractors as well. 
From these critics we are able to ascertain what life was like at 
Versailles. The due de Saint-Simon, a member of the court but no 
admirer of Louis, recorded in his diary: 

Versailles...the dullest of all places, without prospect, without 
wood, without water without soil; for the ground is all shifting 
sand or swamp, the air accordingly bad....You are introduced 
[in the gardens] to the freshness of the shade only by a vast tor¬ 
rid zone....The violence everywhere done to nature repels and 
wearies us despite ourselves. The abundance of water forced up 
and gathered together in all parts is rendered green thick and 
muddy; it disseminates humidity, unhealthy and evident; and an 
odor still more so. I might never finish upon the monstrous 
defects of a palace so immense. 

Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and of the Regency by the 
Duke of Saint-Simon, II (New York: P. F. Collier and Son, 1910) 

THE STYLE OF JULES HARDOUIN-MANSART Constrained 
at Versailles by the design of Le Vau, Jules Hardouin-Mansart s 
own style can be better appreciated in the church of the Invalides 
(fig. 21.16), best known today for housing the tomb of Napoleon. 
Originally the structure formed part of a hospital that served as a 
hostel for the many disabled soldiers returning from Louis’s con¬ 
tinuous wars, gathering them off the streets of Paris where they 
might incite disorder. The complex consists of a series of dormi¬ 
tories, dining halls, infirmaries, and two chapels—a simple, 
unadorned one for the soldiers and an elaborate, domed space for 
the king, where he could be seen high above them during his 
visits. Hardouin-Mansart s design visually connected the sacrifice 
of the soldiers to their allegiance to the king and the absolute 
authority of the monarchy. 

In plan, the Invalides consists of a Greek cross with four 
corner chapels (fig. 21.17); it is based on Michelangelos and 
Bramantes centralized plans for St. Peters. The dome, too, 
reflects the influence of Michelangelo, but consists of three shells 
instead of the usual two. The facade breaks forward repeatedly in 
the crescendo effect introduced by Maderno (see fig. 19.13), and 
the facade and dome are as closely linked as at Borrominis 
Sant’Agnese in the Piazza Navona (see fig. 19.23). The dome itself 
is the most original, as well as the most Baroque, feature of 
Hardouin-Mansart s design. Tall and slender, it rises in a single 
continuous curve from the base of the drum to the spire atop the 
lantern. On the first drum rests a second, short drum. Its windows 
provide light for the paintings on the dome s interior. The windows 
are hidden behind a “pseudo-shell” with a large opening at the top 
so that the painted visions of heavenly glory seem to be mysteri¬ 
ously illuminated and suspended in space. The bold theatrical 
lighting of the Invalides places it firmly within the Baroque style.

Sculpture: The Impact of Bernini 

Sculpture evolved into an official royal style in much the same 
way as architecture—through the influence of Rome and the 
impact of Bernini s visit to the royal court in 1665. While in Paris, 
Bernini carved a marble bust of Louis XIV. He was also commis¬ 
sioned to create an equestrian statue of the king, which he later 
executed in Rome and sent back to Paris, where it was reworked. 
It is now at Versailles. 

ANTOINE COYSEVOX Berninis influence can be seen in the 
work of Antoine Coysevox (1640-1720), the first in a long line of 
distinguished French portrait sculptors and one of the artists 
employed by Charles Le Brun at Versailles. The large stucco relief 
of the victorious Louis XIV that Coysevox made for the Salon de 
la Guerre (see fig. 21.16) retains the pose of Berninis equestrian 
statue, although it has more restraint. In a vivacious terra-cotta 
portrait of the influential Le Brun (fig. 21.18), Coysevox shows 
the artist with head turned to the side and slightly parted lips in a 
“speaking likeness” of the kind we have already seen in the paint¬ 
ings of Frans Hals (see fig. 20.17). The drapery folded over itself 
below the shoulder line recalls the general outline of Bernini s 
bust of Louis XIV. Le Brun s face, however, shows a naturalism 
and subtle characterization that are Coysevox s own.

PIERRE-PAUL PUGET Of all the seventeenth-century French 
sculptors, Pierre-Paul Puget (1620-1694) best represents the High 
Baroque style. Puget had no success at court until after Colbert s 
death, when Le Brun s power began to decline. His finest statue, 
Milo ofCrotona (fig. 21.19), owes its fierceness and drama to the 
impact of Bernini s trip to Paris and benefits from a comparison 
with Berninis David (see fig. 19.30). Although Pugets composi¬ 
tion is more contained, he nevertheless successfully conveys the 
dramatic force of the hero as he is attacked by a lion while his 
hand is trapped in a tree stump. The creature attacks from behind 
and digs its claws deeply into the thigh of Milo, who twists 
painfully and cries out in agony. The violent action imbues the 
statue with an intensity that also recalls the Laocoon (see page 
183). This reference to antiquity, one suspects, is what made the 
work acceptable to Louis XIV. 


CHAPTER 21 THE BAROQUE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND 753 



BAROQUE ARCHITECTURE 
IN ENGLAND 

The English contribution to the Baroque came mostly in the form 
of architecture since in painting it was artists from Italy, Flanders, 
and the Dutch Republic (Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, 
Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens—the latter two were 
knighted during their stays—who dominated the English royal 
court through the century. Orazio Gentileschi and Rubens 
worked for James I, while Charles Is court painter Van Dyck exe¬ 
cuted both portraits and allegorical paintings (see figs. 20.7 and 
20.8). After Van Dyck’s death, many artists continued his style of 
portraiture for wealthy patrons, initiating little in the visual arts 
until the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. After the Great Fire of 
London in 1666, the rebuilding of the city gave priority to archi¬ 
tecture, which thereafter represented the most important English 
artistic achievement. 

Inigo Jones and the Impact of Palladio 

The first significant English architect was Inigo Jones 
(1573-1652), architect to James I and Charles I as well as the era’s 
leading English theatrical designer. Jones’s style developed from 
the country-house tradition of large private mansions in parklike 
settings. Jones took two lengthy trips to Italy in 1597-1603 and 
1613-14, with an interlude in Paris in 1609. Upon returning from 
his second trip to Italy, he was appointed surveyor of the king s 
works, a post he held until 1643. Jones was now an affirmed 
disciple of Andrea Palladio, whose work he saw in Venice and 


whose treatises (along with those of Alberti) he owned and anno¬ 
tated. Before Jones, English architecture was a pastiche of 
medieval and Renaissance forms; its high point was the English 
Gothic cathedral (see figs. 12.49-12.54). Jones is responsible for 
introducing Palladios Renaissance Classicism to England, 
although the style took root only in the early decades of the 
eighteenth century, when a building boom resulted in the trend 
called the Palladian Revival. 

The Banqueting House Jones built at Whitehall Palace in 
London (fig. 21 . 20 ) conforms to the principles set out in Palladio’s 
treatises, although it does not copy any specific Palladian project. 
It was originally intended to be used for court ceremonies and 
performances called masques (a spectacle combining dance, 
theater, and music), although evening entertainments were halted 
after 1635 because smoke from torchlights was damaging 
Rubens’s ceiling painting, the Apotheosis of James I. The 
Banqueting House is essentially a Vitruvian “basilica,” a double 
cube with an apse for the king s throne, which Jones has treated as 
a Palladian villa. It is more like a Renaissance palazzo than any 
other building north of the Alps that had been designed at that 
time. Jones uses an ordered, Classical vocabulary and the rules of 
proportion to compose the building in three parts. The Ionic and 
composite orders of the pilasters add an understated elegance, and 
alternating segmental and triangular pediments over the first- 
floor windows create a rhythmic effect. The sculpted garland 
below the roofline and the balustrade above decoratively enhance 
the overall structure. The building is perhaps starker than origi¬ 
nally conceived; it bore colored stones for each of the stories 
before the facade was resurfaced. Jones’s spare style stood as a 
beacon of Classicist orthodoxy in England for 200 years.

Sir Christopher Wren 

But for the destruction caused by the Great Fire of London of 
1666, Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723), the most important 
English architect of the late seventeenth century, might have 
remained an amateur. Wren may be considered the Baroque 
counterpart of the Renaissance artist-scientist. An intellectual 
prodigy, he first studied anatomy and then physics, mathematics, 
and astronomy, and he was highly esteemed by Sir Isaac Newton 
for his understanding of geometry. Early in his career, Wren held 
the position of chair in the astronomy department at Gresham 
College, London, and then professor of mathematics at Oxford 
University. His interest in architecture did not surface until he 
was about 30 years old. His technical knowledge may have 
affected the shape of his buildings; certainly, no previous architect 
had gone to such lengths to conceal a buildings structural 
supports. Only an architect thoroughly grounded in geometry 
and mathematics could have achieved such results, and the tech¬ 
nical proficiency of Wren s structures has continually confounded 
his critics. 


THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON In early September 1666, 
the city of London was devastated by a catastrophic, uncontrol¬ 
lable fire covering 373 acres; four-fifths of the city was razed; 400 
streets smoked and over 100,000 people made homeless. One 
observer famously wrote: “London was, but is no more. ” Within 
a few days, Wren had already planned a new London: The burned 
areas would be cleared and the builders would start anew. His 
drawing of September 11, 1666 has been translated three-dimen- 
sionally here (fig. 21.21) and shows the influence of the planning 
of Renaissance Rome, known to him through engravings, and of 
Paris, a city he had only recently visited. The plan includes wide 
avenues and focal points punctuated by church steeples he would 
design (see fig. 21.24); the focal point (in the detail) is Wrens 
Monument to the Great Fire of London, which was erected 
between 1671 and 1677. Although his plan proved too radical for 
the crown to adopt, Wren was named to the short-lived royal 
commission to reconstruct the city (see www.myartslab.com ) and 
many of his ideas were incorporated into the new urban planning: 
for example, concern about materials (limitations on the use of 
wood), and provisions for pavements and treatment of sewage.

A few years later he began his designs for the rebuilding of the 
almost totally destroyed St. Pauls cathedral (figs. 21.22). Wren 
favored central-plan churches and originally conceived of St. 
Pauls in the shape of a Greek cross with a huge domed crossing, 
based on Michelangelo s plan of St. Peters. This idea was also 
inspired by a previous design by Inigo Jones, who had been 
involved with the restoration of the original Gothic structure of 
St. Paul s earlier in the century. Wren s proposal was rejected by 
the church authorities, however, who favored a conventional 
basilica. In the end, the plan is that of a Latin cross (as can be seen 
in the cut-away reconstruction fig. 21.23), the same followed for 
most Catholic churches, including St. Peter s. This was an ironic 
outcome given that the building program could have provided an 
opportunity to create a new vocabulary for the Protestant Church 
of England. 

On his only journey abroad in 1665-66, Wren visited France 
and met with Bernini, who was in Paris at the invitation of Louis 


XIV to design and complete the Louvre. The influence of this trip 
can be seen on the facade of St. Paul s (as well as in Wren s new 
street plans for London), where the impact of contemporary 
architecture in Paris can be discerned—the double columns of the 
Louvre and the three-part dome of Hardouin-Mansart s church of 
the Invalides. Unlike St. Peters, St. Pauls dome (see fig. 21 . 22 ) 
rises high above the main body of the building and dominates the 
facade. It looks like a much-enlarged version of Bramantes 
Tempietto (see fig. 16.8). St. Paul s is an up-to-date Baroque design 
that reflects Wren s thorough knowledge of the Italian and French 
architecture of the day Indeed, Wren believed that Paris provided 
“the best school of architecture in Europe,” and he was equally 
affected by the Roman Baroque. The lantern and upper part of the 
bell towers suggest that he knew Borrominis Sant’Agnese in 
Piazza Navona (see fig. 19.23), probably from drawings or 
engravings. The present structure reflects not only the complex 
evolution of the design but also later changes made by the com¬ 
mission overseeing construction, which dismissed Wren in 1718. 

For Wren as for Newton (who was appointed a commissioner 
of St. Pauls in 1697), mathematics and geometry were central to 
the new understanding of the universe and humanity s place in it. 
In Wren s Five Tracts , written toward the end of his life and pre¬ 
sented by his son to the Royal Society in 1740, he stated that 
architecture must conform to “natural reason,” which is the basis 
of eternal Beauty In other words, architecture must use rational 
(that is, abstract) geometrical forms, such as the square and the

CHAPTER 21 THE BAROQUE IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND 757 












circle, as well as proportion, perspective, and harmony—but it 
must not sacrifice variety. Such rationality and diversity are 
clearly evident in Wren s design for St. Pauls. 

Besides St. Paul s, Wren worked on 52 of the 87 damaged or 
destroyed churches, designing distinctive steeples for many of 
them. The steeple of the church of St. Mary-le-Bow (fig. 21.24) 
provides us with the most famous example. (It should be noted 
that many of these churches, including this one, were damaged 
during the bombing of London in World War II and have been 
reconstructed.) The steeple is exceptionally tall (225 feet high) and 
even today soars over surrounding buildings. The height is 
achieved through an unusual stacking of components: a two-story 
base (with arched entrance), plain attic, bell housing with paired 
pilasters, and a colonnaded temple surmounted by buttresses that 
support a lantern and obelisklike pinnacle as seen in the church of 
the Invalides. To indicate the church’s dedication, Wren designed 
12 “bows”—actually inverted brackets—at the base of the round 
temple. The result is an elaborate, multistoried steeple, Gothic in 
its verticality yet based on Classical motifs. Nothing like it had 
ever been seen before. Wren s innovations in this church and the 
others built after the Great Fire gave English Baroque church 
architecture its distinctive character. 

John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor 

The marriage of English, French, and Italian Baroque elements is 
still more evident in Blenheim Palace (fig. 21.25), a grandiose 


structure designed by Sir John Vanbrugh (1664-1726), a gifted 
amateur, with the aid of Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736), 
Wren s most talented pupil. Although Blenheim is considered to 
be Vanbrugh s greatest work, the building was in fact completed 
by Hawksmoor; yet the architecture is seamless. Blenheim skill¬ 
fully combines the massing of an English castle with the breadth 
of a country house, the rambling character of a French chateau 
such as Fontainebleau (see fig. 18.1), and a facade inspired by Sir 
Christopher Wren, Vanbrugh s rival. However, when Blenheim 
and its framing colonnade are compared with the piazza of St. 
Peters (see fig. 19.14), Vanbrughs design reveals itself to be even 
closer to Bernini. The main block uses a colossal Corinthian order 
to wed a temple portico with a Renaissance palace, while the 
wings rely on a low-slung Doric order. Such an eclectic approach, 
extreme even by the relaxed standards of the period, is maintained 
in the details. Vanbrugh, like Inigo Jones, had a strong interest in 
the theater and was a popular playwright. Blenheim s theatricality 
and massiveness make it a symbol of English power, a fitting, but 
more modest, counterpart to Versailles in both its structure and 
its grounds. Designed mainly for show and entertainment, it was 
presented by a grateful nation to the duke of Marlborough for his 
victories over French and German forces at the Battle of Blenheim 
in 1704, during the War of Spanish Succession. 

The power and massiveness of Baroque architecture from 
Bernini to Blenheim changed the look of western Europe in the 
seventeenth century. It also provided the foundation for the art and 
architecture of the Rococo—both in continuation and in contrast.

The Rococo 


Pv 1 



I N FRANCE THE ROCOCO STYLE IS LINKED WITH LOUIS XV (1 71 0-1 774) 

because it corresponds roughly to his lifetime—the heart of the eighteenth 
century. But the first signs of the Rococo style had appeared as much as 50 years 
before Louis’s birth, at the height of the late seventeenth-century Baroque style, 
and it continued on through the excesses of the reign of Louis XVI (r. 1774-1792) 


and his wife, Marie Antoinette, to the French Revolution of 1789. 
As noted by the philosopher Franqois-Marie Arouet, better 
known by his pen name, Voltaire (1694-1778), the eighteenth cen¬ 
tury lived indebted to the past. In art, Poussin and Rubens cast 
long shadows over the period. The controversy between their fol¬ 
lowers, in turn, goes back much further to the debate between the 
supporters of Michelangelo and those of Titian over the merits of 
disegno (expressed through drawing or line) versus color (see page 
584). In this sense, the Rococo, like the Baroque, still belongs to 
the Renaissance world. 

Despite similarities between the Baroque and Rococo, a fun¬ 
damental difference exists between the two styles. In a word, it is 
fantasy. If the Baroque presents theater on a grand scale, the Rococo 
stage is smaller and more intimate. Its artifice evokes an enchanted 
realm that presents a diversion from real life. In some ways, the 
Rococo in France manifests a shift in taste among aristocrats, who 
reasserted their power as patrons and began to favor stylized motifs 
drawn from nature and a more domestic art—private rather than 
public—with which to decorate their new homes in Paris. 

The word Rococo fits well, for it implies both a natural qual¬ 
ity and a sense of ornamentation well suited to court life. It was 
coined in the nineteenth century as a disparaging term, taken from 
the French word rocaille (meaning “pebble”) and the Portuguese 

Detail of figure 22.4, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Gersaint’s Signboard 


barocco (“baroque”), to refer to what were then perceived as the 
excessively ornate tastes of the early eighteenth century. The word 
Rococo, then, in the first place refers to the playful, irregular peb¬ 
bles, stones, and shells that decorated grottoes of Italian gardens 
and became the principal motifs of French interior designs. 

Although sometimes viewed as the final phase of the Baroque, 
the Rococo asserted its own stylistic traits and represents a period 
of independent intense creative and intellectual activity. French 
artists continued to be trained in the tradition of the Royal 
Academy of Painting and Sculpture, which stressed working from 
live models, studying anatomy, and practicing perspective and 
proportion—lessons supplemented by lectures on the art of 
Raphael and Poussin. Yet artists also began exploring new sub¬ 
jects and treating old themes in new ways. The interest in the 
poetic genre of the pastoral, as practiced by Baroque artists 
including Claude (see pages 743-44), with subjects of love and 
loss, romantic trysts, and poetic musings took on growing impor¬ 
tance in the eighteenth century. Patrons were increasingly taken 
with the notion of the “simple man” existing in an idealized 
nature. By way of response, the French Academy even established 
a new category to reflect this new interest, called the jete galante , 
a type of painting introduced by Jean-Antoine Watteau. The style 
celebrated the tradition of love and eroticism in art, and broad¬ 
ened the range of human emotion depicted there. 

Although most directly associated with France, the Rococo 
exerted a wide geographical influence and affected the arts in most

of western and central Europe (map 22.1). In Germany and 
Austria, the devastation of the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) was 
followed in the eighteenth century by a period of rebuilding and 
a growth in the number of pilgrimage churches, whose architec¬ 
ture and decoration reflected both the transformation of the 
Baroque and the new Rococo style. Italian artists such as Tiepolo, 
with his assistants, painted ceiling frescoes in central European 
churches and palaces in this new elaborate and elegant style and 
produced similar works for their native city of Venice as well. 
There, Canaletto painted vedute , or scenes of the city, which pro¬ 
vided foreign visitors with souvenirs of their Venetian stay. 

European colonization of the New World continued in the 
eighteenth century. Armies battled to secure these distant lands, 
depleting their nations’ treasuries but succeeding in sending back 
to their homelands exotic objects, including feathers, jewels, and 
metals that collectors coveted and artists used in the creation of 
new art. In the performing arts, the Venetian composer Antonio 
Vivaldi (1678-1741) and the German composer Johann Sebastian 
Bach (1685-1750) produced extraordinary music, and London 
became home to established theater, notably in Haymarket, 
Drury Lane, and Covent Garden. 


FRANCE: THE RISE OF THE ROCOCO 

After the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the nobility, formerly 
attached to the court at Versailles, found themselves freer from 
royal control. Louis XV, only two years old at Louis XIV’s death, 
would not be crowned until 1723. This early period of the 
Rococo—between 1715 and 1723—is known as the Regency, so- 
called because Lrance was governed by Louis’s cousin Philip, 
duke of Orleans, who was acting as regent. With a nobleman in 
power, the aristocracy regained much of their former authority, 
and they abandoned the strict, demanding court life of Versailles. 
Rather than returning to their chateaux in the provinces, many 
chose to live in Paris, where they built elegant town houses with 
small intimate rooms. These hotels particuliers developed into 
social centers, known as salons, for intellectual gatherings. The 
rooms were decorated with paintings, porcelain, and small sculp¬ 
tures that created a lavish, light-hearted mood. Paintings, there¬ 
fore, were just one element in the creation of an ambiance of 
refinement that permeated pre-revolutionary Prance. These 
paintings, as well as interior designs, would influence the decor of 
western and central Europe throughout the century. 


762 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 







Painting: Poussinistes versus Rubenistes 

Toward the end of the seventeenth century, a dispute arose among 
the members of the French Academy, who formed themselves 
into two factions: the Poussinistes and the Rubenistes. Neither 
Poussin nor Rubens was still alive at the time of this debate, 
which focused on the issue of drawing versus color. French artists 
were familiar with Poussin s paintings, which had been sent from 
Rome back to Paris throughout his career, and they knew 
Rubens s work from the Marie de’ Medici Cycle (see fig. 20.5) in 
the Luxembourg Palace. The conservative Poussinistes defended 
Poussin s view that line, which appealed to the mind, was superior 
to color, which appealed to the senses. The Rubenistes (many of 
whom were of Flemish descent) favored color, rather than draw¬ 
ing, as being truer to nature. They also pointed out that drawing, 
while admittedly based on reason, appealed only to the expert 
few, whereas color appealed to everyone. This argument had 
important implications. It suggested that the layperson should be 
the judge of artistic values, which challenged the Renaissance 
notion that painting, as a liberal art, could be appreciated only by 
the educated mind. The colorists eventually won the day, due in 
part to the popularity of painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. 

JEAN-ANTOINE WATTEAU The greatest of the Rubenistes 
was Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721). Born in Valenciennes, 
which until a few years before his birth had still been part of the 
Southern Netherlands, Watteau showed an affinity for the work 
of Rubens, the region s greatest artist. After moving to Paris in 
1702, he made many drawings styled after Rubenss French 


works, including the Marie de ’ Medici Cycle (see fig. 20.5). 
Watteau was a significant contributor to the new Rococo style as 
well as to the new subjects associated with it. His painted visions 
show idyllic images of aristocratic life, with elegant figures luxu¬ 
riously dressed in shimmering pastel colors and set in dreamlike 
outdoor settings. He often seamlessly interweaves theater and real 
life in his works, incorporating well-known characters from the 
commedia delVarte (a type of improvisational Italian theater) and 
creating stagelike settings that serve as backdrops for his actors. 
The carefully posed figures evoke forlorn love, regret, or nostal¬ 
gia, and imbue the scenes with an air of melancholy. Such works 
became increasingly sought after by collectors in France, and the 
popularity of such themes soon spread throughout Europe. 

Because Watteau s fantasies had little historical or mythologi¬ 
cal basis, his paintings broke many academic rules and did not 
conform to any established category. In order to be able to admit 
Watteau as a member, the French Academy had to create a new 
classification of painting, jetes galantes (meaning “elegant fetes” 
or “outdoor entertainments”). This category joined the hierarchy 
of genres that had been established in the seventeenth century by 
academy member Andre Felibien (1619-1695). The premier cate¬ 
gory was history painting, considered to be the highest form of 
art because it was thought to require the most imagination and 
was therefore the most difficult to execute. Next came portraits, 
landscapes, and finally still lifes. Watteau s reception piece for the 
French Academy, required when he became a member in 1712, 
was not delivered until five years later. The work, A Pilgrimage to 
Cythera (fig. 22.1), is an evocation of love and includes elements 
of classical mythology. Cythera, which came to be viewed as an

island of love, was one of the settings for the Greek myth of the 
birth of Aphrodite (Venus), who rose from the foam of the sea. 
The title suggests this traditional subject, but the painting was 
described in the French Academy records as a jete galante , 
perhaps the first use of this term. 

Watteau has created a delightful yet slightly melancholic scene. 
It is unclear whether the couples are arriving at or leaving the 
island. The action unfolds in the foreground from right to left like 
a continuous narrative, which suggests that the figures may be 
about to board the boat. Two lovers remain engaged in their 
amorous tryst; behind them, another couple rises to follow a third 
pair down the hill as the reluctant young woman casts a longing 
look back at the goddess’s sacred grove. Young couples, accompa¬ 
nied by swarms of cupids, pay homage to Venus, whose garlanded 
sculpture appears on the far right. The delicate colors—pale 
greens, blues, pinks, and roses—suggest the gentle nature of the 
lovers’ relationships. The subtle gradations of tone showed 
Watteau’s debt to Rubens and helped establish the supremacy of 
the Rubenistes. 

As a fashionable conversation piece, the scene recalls the 
elegant figures in the courtly scenes of the Limbourg brothers’ 
illuminations and those in Rubens’s The Garden of Love (see figs. 
14.3 and 20.6), but Watteau has altered the scale and added a touch 
of poignancy reminiscent of Giorgione and Titian. Watteau’s 
figures are slim, graceful, and small in scale; they appear even

more so when compared with most Baroque imagery. The land¬ 
scape does not overwhelm the scene but echoes its idyllic and 
somewhat elegiac mood. Watteau produces a sense of nostalgia, 
with its implications of longing and unrealized passion. This is 
achieved not only through the figures and their gentle touching 
and hesitancy but also through the sympathetic parallel found in 
his landscape and the sculptures in it. 

A similarly nostalgic atmosphere is evoked in Watteau’s 
Mezzetin (fig. 22.2), a painting of a stock figure from the comme- 
dia delTarte , whose name means “half-measure” and who played 
the role of an amorous suitor. He sings a pleading love song while 
playing his guitar in a parklike setting decorated with a statue of 
a woman in the background. Scholars presume that he is playing 
his music to her. It has been suggested that the painting, which 
was owned by Watteau’s friend Jean de Jullienne (the author of a 
biography of the artist; see Primary Source , page 766), may have 
related to Jean’s courtship of his wife. The wistful musician strains 
to look up to the right, out of the picture. Yet the fantastical, del¬ 
icately striped costume of rose, pale blue, and white, paired with 
yellow shoes and rose beret and cape, transforms the scene from 
melancholic to magical. The small, single figure in pastel colors, 
set amid this pale verdant setting, is typical of the Rococo in terms 
of spirit, figure type, and color of costume and setting. 

As already stated, Watteau’s use of color planted him firmly in 
the Rubeniste camp. However, his innovations and creativity as a

draftsman (which would have implied a Poussiniste status) com¬ 
bined both color and line. (See Materials and Techniques , page 
769.) Although previous artists, including Rubens, may have 
drawn with red or black chalk heightened with white, Watteau 
excelled in this technique, known as trois crayons. In Seated 
Young Woman (fig. 22.3), he uses the three chalks to best effect, so 
that the red color that defines her body—legs, hands, parts of her 
face (lips, tip of nose), nape, breast—suggests a vivacious quality 
when contrasted against the black and white of her clothing, eye¬ 
brows, and upswept hair. The colors enliven and add a spontane¬ 
ity to this life drawing. In numerous sketches, Watteau worked 
out poses, movements, gestures, and expressions, many of which 
(although apparently not this drawing) served as studies for 
figures in his paintings. 

The same informality can be seen in one of Watteau s best- 
known works, Gersaint’s Signboard or The Shop Sign (fig. 22.4 and 
page 760). Created to advertise the wares of his friend and art 
dealer Edme Gersaint, the sign does not in fact show Gersaint s 
gallery. Gersaint wrote about this commission and indicated that 
it was made at Watteau s suggestion to allow him to “stretch his 
fingers” after he had returned from a trip to London. Watteau had 
been ill (he would die soon after of tuberculosis), and the implica¬ 
tion was that the artist used this work as part of his hoped-for 


convalescence. This account has since been disputed, but the 
work remains Watteau s last. The painting (originally arched at 
top) reportedly took only eight mornings to complete. It was 
meant to be exhibited outside but was shown for only 15 days 
(perhaps due to the weather or because it sold quickly). Gersaint 
reported that the painting attracted many artists as well as 
passersby who admired the natural, elegant poses of the figures— 
traits still admired today. The voluminous rose satin dress of the 
woman on the left, seen from the back, draws the eye; this figure 
is balanced by the languidly leaning woman on the right. 
Sophisticated and comfortable in the setting, the women are 
attended to by a solicitous staff as they admire paintings in the 
shop, arranged three to four high on the walls. Scholars do not 
believe these are copies of actual paintings but rather variants on 
Flemish and Venetian works, a theory that seems plausible when 
this work is compared with Jan Brueghel the Elder s Allegory of 
Sight and its real painting gallery (see fig. 20.10). The shop s stock 
also includes a variety of clocks and mirrors, which create an 
atmosphere of opulence and would remind the viewer of the world 
of the ancien regime. This association is supported by a portrait of 
Louis XIV based on Rigauds (see fig. 21.10), seen on the left, 
which is being placed in a crate. Although on one level the pres¬ 
ence of the king s image suggests the departure of the old (he had

Jean de Jullienne (1686-1767) 



A Summary of the Life of Antoine Watteau, 
1684-1721 

Jullienne, a dyer and later the director of the Gobelin tapestry manu¬ 
factory , was a lifelong friend of Watteau's and a collector of his works. 
At Watteau's death, he had all of the artist's drawings engraved and 
later did the same with his paintings, afier buying many of them. His 
biography of the artist was first published in two volumes in 1726-28, 
along with 350 engravings afier Watteau's paintings and drawings. 
Another two volumes followed. 

W atteau, inclined more and more to study, and excited by the 
beauties of the gallery of this palace [the Luxembourg Palace] 
painted by Rubens, often went to study the color and the composi¬ 
tion of this great master. This in a short time gave him a taste much 
more natural and very different from that which he had acquired 
with Gillot. ... 

Watteau was of medium height and weak constitution. He had a 
quick and penetrating mind and elevated sensibilities. He spoke little 
but well, and wrote likewise. He almost always meditated. A great 
admirer of nature and of all the masters who have copied her, assidu¬ 
ous work had made him a little melancholy. Cold and awkward in 
demeanor, which sometimes made him difficult to his friends and 


often to himself, he had no other fault than that of indifference and of 
a liking for change. It can be said that no painter ever had more fame 
than he during his life as well as after his death. His paintings which 
have risen to a very high price are today still eagerly sought after. They 
may be seen in Spain, in England, in Germany, in Prussia, in Italy, and 
in many places in France, especially in Paris. Also one must concede 
that there are no more agreeable pictures for small collections than his. 
They incorporate the correctness of drawing, truth of color and an 
inimitable delicacy of brushwork. He not only excelled in gallant and 
rustic compositions, but also in subjects of the army, of marches, and 
bivouacs of soldiers, whose simple and natural character makes this 
sort of pictures very precious. He even left a few historical pieces whose 
excellent taste shows well enough that he would have been equally 
successful in this genre if he had made it his principal objective. 

Although Watteau’s life was very short, the great number of his 
works could make one think that it was very long, whereas it only 
shows that he was very industrious. Indeed, even his hours of 
recreation and walking were never spent without his studying 
nature and drawing her in the situations in which she seemed to him 
most admirable. 

The quantity of drawings produced by his study and which have 
been chose to be engraved and to form a separate work is a proof of 
this truth.

Princeton University Press, 1 982) 


died only a few years before in 1715), it is actually a pun on the 
name of the shop, Au Grand Monarque. Watteau’s extraordinary 
abilities as a painter are apparent as he transforms this commercial 
venture into a sensitive work of sophistication and tender beauty. 

FRANCOIS BOUCHER Following the untimely death of 
Watteau in 1721, Francois Boucher (1703-1770) rose to promi¬ 
nence in French painting. Boucher built his reputation on his 
imaginative compositions, pastoral landscapes, and scenes of 
bourgeois daily life. He served as court painter to Madame de 
Pompadour (1721-1764), who has been called the “godmother of 
the Rococo. ” She was Louis XV s mistress, as well as his frequent 
political advisor and a major patron of the arts. 

Boucher painted her portrait numerous times and with his 
1756 life-size painting: Portrait of Madame de Pompadour (fig. 22.5) 
he established—even orchestrated—her self-fashioning as a femme- 
savante —an educated, cultured, accomplished woman who was also 
elegant, beautiful, and sophisticated. Born Jeanne-Antoinnette 
Poisson, she became the Royal Mistress (an actual title) in 1746. 
She had come from a nonaristocratic family, but because of her 
relationship with the king had been made a duchess, a marquis, 
and in the year this painting was done (when she was 35 years old 
and no longer his mistress, but lifelong confidante), she was 
named Lady-in-Waiting to the Queen, the highest nonroyal title 
at court. It has even been suggested that the background clock 
indicates the actual time she was given this title (although 8:20 is 
often the time set on old clocks for display purposes). 


Madame de Pompadour is shown amid luxurious surround¬ 
ings wearing a dress that signals opulence. The voluminous nature 
of the shimmering fabric, its turquoise blue color, and the intri¬ 
cacy of its bows and sewn roses also show off her small, narrow 
waist. She sits in her boudoir/library, which reflects the range of 
her accomplishments. The rosewood writing table set with pen, 
ink, and envelopes and the well-used book in her hand as well as 
the many in the cabinet and on the floor (truly an overflow) 
further confirm—even define—her level of literacy and qualify 
her as an educated woman. She also identified herself with Venus. 
The cupid by the clock, the roses on her dress and at her feet, and 
the pearl bracelets (pearls from the sea in which Venus was born) 
are each attributes that suggest her affinity with the love-goddess. 
She doesn’t just sit on the day bed ( chaise longue ), but leans on its 
pillows, much like the languid female customer in Watteaus 
Gersaint's Signboard (see fig. 22.4). It suggests a relaxed, casual 
mood—the nonchalance of the leisurely aristocracy. 

We can also compare the portrait to Rubens’s life-size 
Marchesa Brigida Spinola Doria (see fig. 20.3), who strides from 
her palazzo. The Rococo portrait uses the play of diagonals (in 
her posture) and verticals (the pilasters, bookcase, and mirror’s 
gilt frame) in much the same way Rubens uses these design 
elements. But the pastel colors, detail, and opulence anchor 
Boucher’s painting in the Rococo world. The painting mirrors the 
luxurious and exuberant lifestyles of Madame de Pompadour, 
and the French aristocracy, for whom Boucher’s works held 
great appeal.

JEAN-HONORE FRAGONARD Transforming fantasy into 
reality in paint was the forte of Jean-Honore Fragonard 
(1732-1806)—or at least that was the reputation of this star pupil 
of Boucher. Also a brilliant colorist, Fragonard won the distin¬ 
guished Rome Prize in 1752 and spent five years in Rome, 
beginning in 1756. Upon his return to Paris, he worked mostly for 
private collectors. Fantasy, flirtation, and licentiousness—in 
short, the spirit of the Rococo and the tradition that began with 
Watteau—coalesce in his painting The Swing (fig. 22.6). An anec¬ 
dote provides an interpretation of the painting. According to the 
story, another artist, Gabriel-Frangois Doyen, was approached by 
the baron de Saint-Julien to paint his mistress “on a swing which 
a bishop is setting in motion. You will place me in a position in 


which I can see the legs of the lovely child and even more if you 
wish to enliven the picture. ” Doyen declined the commission but 
directed it to Fragonard. 

The painting, an example of an “intrigue,” suggests a collusion 
in erotic fantasy between the artist and patron, with the clergy as 
their unwitting dupe. This “boudoir painting” (on the subject of 
sexual intimacy) offers the thrill of sexual opportunity and 
voyeurism but translated to a stagelike outdoor setting. The inno¬ 
cence of the public arena heightens the teasing quality of the 
motion of the swing toward the patron-viewer. The painted 
sculpture of a cupid to the left, holding a finger to his lips, sug¬ 
gests the conspiracy in the erotic escapade in which we as viewers 
are now participants. Fragonard used painted sculpture in many

Pastel Painting 

P astels are a form of colored chalks or powders that are mixed (or 
filtered) with glue, juice, gum arabic, or whey and then rolled into 
a cylindrical tube. They are made and sold today in much the same way 
as they were in the Rococo era. The fillers and water enable the pas¬ 
tels to be applied smoothly. Pastels can be soft or hard, but they must 
be dried out to be packaged as pastel crayons. 

Leonardo worked with pastels in the late fifteenth century (for his 
portrait of Isabella d’Este, 1499), but they really gained popularity 
among artists in the sixteenth century. Yet artists used them only to 
execute preparatory drawings, not to create finished works. In the 
eighteenth century, however, artists realized the possibilities of the 
medium and began making pastel paintings as finished works. Pastels, 
as well as the popular trois crayons technique (see fig. 22.3), had the 
advantage of suggesting both line and color at the same time. Since 
much debate arose in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth 
centuries about drawing (i.e., line) versus color, and since critics 
lauded artists such as Raphael who could combine both, the use of 
pastels may be considered a response to this issue. The lines could be 
smudged, built on each other, or hatched so that a single line could 
become an area of color and several together could create an even 
more vibrant patch. 

Artists chose pastels primarily to make portraits, applying flicks of 
color to suggest animation, emotion, or expression and thus giving 
the sitter a more vivid and lifelike appearance. One of the greatest 
pastel portraitists is Rosalba Carriera (1 675-1 757), a Venetian artist 
known for revealing the psychological intensity of her sitters. Carriera 
was famous in her own time and had an international clientele of 
British, French, German, and Polish patrons. She became a member of 
the Academy of St. Luke of Rome in 1 705, the Academy Clementina of 
Bologna in 1 720, and the French Academy in 1 721. Upon traveling to 
Paris in 1 720-21, she was hailed by both the French court and French 
artists including Hyacinthe Rigaud (see Chapter 21) and Watteau (see 
pages 763-66), who made several drawings of her. The intimacy and

of his works to echo or reinforce their themes. Set in a lush arbor, 
this scene encapsulates the secluded “place of love” that provides 
secrecy for this erotic encounter. The dense and overgrown land¬ 
scape, lit by radiant sunlight, suggests the warmth of spring or 
summer and their overtones of sexuality and fertility. The glow¬ 
ing pastel colors create an otherworldly haze that enhances the 
sensuality of this fantasy spun by Fragonard. 

Fragonard epitomized the sensuality of the Rococo, and his 
works are marked by an extraordinary virtuosity in their use of 
color. His paintings range from erotic fantasies to intimate studies 
and pastoral landscapes, subjects that provided a distraction for 
his wealthy patrons.

JEAN-SI ME ON CHARDIN Raised in a bourgeois household, 
Jean-Simeon Chardin (1699-1779) rose to become treasurer of the 
French Academy as well as its tapissier , responsible for installing 
the paintings at its exhibitions. Chardin s expertise in still life as 
well as in genre painting was indebted to the many Dutch and 
Flemish seventeenth-century paintings then in France (many of 
these small, highly portable paintings were sold at auction). 
Indeed, some of Chardin s own patrons were important collectors 
of seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish art. 

To Chardins patrons, members of the rising bourgeoisie in 
France, such genre scenes and domestic still lifes proclaimed the 
virtues of hard work, frugality, honesty, and devotion to family. 
Chardin s quiet household scenes struck a chord with his sophis¬ 
ticated patrons, and demand for them was so high that he often 
painted copies of his most popular subjects. His paintings were 
also reproduced as prints, making them affordable to those who 
lacked the means to buy an original work. 


CHAPTER 22 THE ROCOCO 769 


MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 








Soap Bubbles (fig. 22.7) is very much an outgrowth of Dutch 
genre painting and the vanitas symbols frequently seen in the still- 
life tradition. The bubble, intact only for a moment, symbolizes 
the brevity of life, which serves as one of the painting s underly¬ 
ing themes. However, Chardin has chosen a charming, endearing 
way to send his message to a viewer. He presents two children: an 
older boy who is possibly instructing a younger one, who eagerly 
looks on—play was a common theme in Chardin s work. Unlike 
most Rococo painting, the figures in this work are half-length, 
life-size rather than diminutive, and their scale affects our under¬ 
standing of the reality, reinforcing the possibility that we could 
encounter a similar scene in our own world. 

Back from the Market (fig. 22.8) shows life in a Parisian bour¬ 
geois household. We see the large room but cannot ignore the 
potentially amorous scene taking place outside on the left. The 
maid s posture, leaning to her left with her shoes pointed to the 
right, suggests informality (we have seen this leaning in figs. 22.4 
and 22.5). The beauty hidden in everyday life and a clear sense of 
spatial order beg comparison with the Dutch artist Jan Vermeer 
(see fig. 20.35). However, Chardin s brushwork is soft at the edges 
and suggests objects rather than defines them. In the still-life

elements in the painting (the floured loaves of bread are especially 
notable), he summarizes forms and subtly alters their appearance 
and texture. Thus, one can understand the appeal of pastel paint¬ 
ing (see Materials and Techniques , page 769) as Chardin often 
turned to this medium late in life, when his eyes were failing him. 

Still-life painting was important to Chardin (see page 769) as 
it was as a still-life artist (considered the lowest rank of painting) 
that he was admitted to the French Academy. But he raised this 
form of painting in its simplicity and elegance to a newly appreci¬ 
ated level. The Brioche (The Dessert ), named for the center roll, 
displays a variety of textures set on a ledge that we view at eye 
level (fig. 22.9). We can compare Chardin s painting to Heda s Still 
Life with Oysters , Roemer , a Lemon , and a Silver Bowl (see fig. 
20.31). Texture in the Dutch work is created by the defined, 
sparkling edges of the broken glass, the shine of the silver, and the 
distinct reflections in the roemer. In Chardins work, we are 
mostly impressed by the blurring of the edges: on the brioche 
topped with an orange branch, in the difficult-to-discern facets of 
the glass liqueur bottle on the right, and in the gilt-edged Meissen 
tureen on the left. Chardin used contemporary ceramics and 
porcelain in his paintings: German Meissen porcelain (celebrated 
French Sevres would be its rival later in the century) was produced

in imitation of Chinese porcelain. In fact, in the eighteenth 
century, the tureen in the painting was described as Chinese 
(although, as is clear from the painted images on it, it is not). 

Chinoiserie 

Chinese wares—in the Netherlands spurred on by the Dutch East 
India Company (see page 700), in France, and throughout 
Europe—were wildly popular. As such, the Chinese also began 
making pieces for export to fulfill the desires of the European 
market, and European manufacturers developed products and 
designs in imitation of the Chinese. These items in Chinese style 
were known as Chinoiserie (chinois means “Chinese” in French) 
and belonged mostly to the decorative arts: silk, furniture (desks, 
cabinets), screens, garden decor, lacquerware, and of course, 


porcelain. But perhaps the most significant Chinese export to 
Europe was tea, which first came to Europe through the Dutch 
East India Company in 1610. 

Drinking tea changed both the daily routines of individuals 
and the economies of nations. It was only in the eighteenth 
century that tea sets (teapots, cups and saucers, sugar bowls, 
creamers and the utensils for them) in a variety of materials 
(porcelain, silver, pewter) were first created. Jean-Etienne 
Liotard s (1702-1789) Still Life Tea Set (fig. 22.10) is an example of 
several levels of Chinoiserie—the tea, the porcelain Chinese-style 
tea set with images of Chinese figures and decoration (an example 
of Chinese export ware), all assembled on a lacquer tray 

Both Watteau and Boucher created designs in Chinoiserie for 
various patrons in prints, lacquerware and tapestry designs.

used Chinoiserie elements in his work. This was a style that artists 
could adapt to their own ends. 

The French Rococo Interior 

It is in the intimate spaces of early eighteenth-century interiors 
that the full elegance and charm of the Rococo are shown. The 
Parisian hotels of the dispersed nobility soon developed into 
social centers. The field of "design for private living” took on new 
importance at this time. Because these city sites were usually 
cramped and irregular, they offered few opportunities for impres¬ 
sive exteriors. Hence, the layout and decor of the rooms became 
the architects’ main concern. The hotels demanded an intimate 
style of interior decoration that gave full scope to individual 
fancy, uninhibited by the classicism seen in the monumentality 
of Versailles. 

Crucial to the development of French decor was the new 
importance assigned to interior designers. Their engravings estab¬ 
lished new standards of design that were expected to be followed 


by artisans, who thereby lost much of their independence. 
Designers also collaborated with architects, who became more 
involved in interior decoration. Along with sculptors, who often 
created the architectural ornamentation, and painters, architects 
helped to raise the decorative arts to the level of the fine arts, thus 
establishing a tradition that continues today. The decorative and 
fine arts were most clearly joined in furniture. Gilt, metals, and 
enamels were often applied to interior decor to create the feathery 
ornamentation associated with the Rococo. Many of these arti¬ 
sans came originally from the Netherlands, Germany and Italy 
The decorative arts played a unique role during the Rococo. 
Hotel interiors were more than collections of objects: They 
were total environments assembled with extraordinary care by 
discerning collectors and the talented architects, sculptors, deco¬ 
rators, and dealers who catered to their exacting taste. A room, 
like an item of furniture, could require the services of a wide 
variety of artisans: cabinetmakers, wood carvers, gold- and silver¬ 
smiths, upholsterers, and porcelain makers. The products of these 
artisans were set in white rooms decorated with gilt molding and 


772 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 




pastel-colored Rococo paintings, the overall effect being 
enhanced by mirrors and lighting. The artisans involved were 
dedicated to producing an ensemble, even though each craft was, 
by tradition, a separate specialty subject to strict regulations. 
Together they fueled the insatiable hunger for novelty that swept 
the aristocracy and haute bourgeoisie of Europe. 

NICOLAS PINEAU Few of these Rococo rooms survive intact; 
the vast majority have been destroyed or greatly changed, or the 
objects and decorations have been dispersed. Even so, we can get 
a good idea of their appearance through the reconstruction of one 
such room (perhaps from the ground floor behind the garden ele¬ 
vation) from the Hotel de Varengeville, Paris (fig. 22.11), designed 
about 1735 by Nicolas Pineau (1684-1754) for the duchesse de 
Villars. Pineau had spent 14 years in Russia collaborating with 
other French craftsmen on Peter the Great s elaborate new city of 


St. Petersburg. His room for the duchess incorporates many con¬ 
temporary Rococo features. To create a sumptuous effect, the 
white walls are encrusted with gilded stucco ornamentation in 
arabesques, C-scallops, S-scrolls, fantastic birds, bat s wings, and 
acanthus foliage sprays. The elaborately carved furniture is 
embellished with gilt bronze. Everything swims in a sea of 
swirling patterns united by perhaps the most sophisticated sense 
of design and materials the world has ever known. No clear 
distinction exists between decoration and function in the richly 
designed fireplace and the opulent chandelier. The paintings, too, 
have been completely integrated into the decorative scheme, with 
works by Boucher set over two of the doors (such paintings even 
established a new type of work called “overdoors”). Similarly 
elaborate, gilt-decorated white walls became the hallmark of the 
Rococo, not only in its private spaces, but in church and palace 
decoration as well, especially in central Europe (see pages 776-77).

CLODION AND FRENCH ROCOCO SCULPTURE Used to 
adorn interiors, French Rococo sculpture took many forms and 
was designed to be viewed at close range. A typical example is the 
small Nymph and Satyr Carousing (fig. 22.12) by Claude Michel 
(1738-1814), known as Clodion, a successful sculptor of the 
Rococo period who later effectively adapted his style to the more 
austere Neoclassical manner. Clodion began his studies at 
Versailles and won the prestigious Rome Prize. His greatest con¬ 
tribution to the Rococo was transforming the fantasies of 
Boucher and Fragonard into three-dimensional works of coquet¬ 
tish eroticism. The open and airy composition of this sculpture is 
related to a work by Bernini, but its miniature scale produces a 
more intimate and sensual effect. Although Clodion undertook 
several large sculptural cycles in marble, he reigned supreme in 
the more intimate medium of terra cotta. 

THE ROCOCO IN WESTERN EUROPE 
OUTSIDE OF FRANCE 

The French Rococo exerted a major influence across the English 
Channel. There, foreign artists—Holbein, Gentileschi, Rubens, 
Van Dyck—had flourished for generations, and the works of 
Dutch and Italian artists were widely collected. Although foreign 


artists still reigned supreme, the Rococo helped to bring about 
the first school of English painting since the Middle Ages that had 
more than local importance. As we have seen with the works of 
Chardin and Rubens, among others, printmaking was used not 
just to create new compositions but to disseminate painted 
works, giving them a larger audience and broader appeal. This 
medium proved most beneficial for genre paintings and land¬ 
scapes, areas of great interest to, and increasingly collected by, the 
British public. 

William Hogarth and the Narrative 

William Hogarth (1697-1764) was the first major native English 
artist since Nicholas Hilliard (see fig. 18.25). He began his career 
as an engraver and soon took up painting. Although he must have 
learned lessons about color and brushwork from Venetian and 
French examples, as well as from Van Dyck, his work is entirely 
original. He made his mark in the 1730s with a new kind of paint¬ 
ing, which he described as “modern moral subjects ... similar to 
representations on the stage. ” Hogarths work is in the same vein 
as John Gays The Beggar's Opera of 1728, a biting social and 
political stage satire that Hogarth illustrated in one of his paint¬ 
ings. Hogarth’s morality paintings teach, by bad example, solid 
middle-class virtues and reflect the desire for a return to simpler 
times and values. They proved enormously popular among the 
newly prosperous middle class in England. 

In the scene reproduced here both as a painting and an engrav¬ 
ing (figs. 22.13 and 22.14), taken from his The Rake's Progress 
series, the artist shows a young man, Tom Rakewell, who has just 
received an inheritance and is now spending his fortune by 
overindulging in wine and women. He is seen disheveled and 
drunk. (Later in the series, the rogue enters into a marriage of 
convenience, is arrested for debt, turns to gambling, goes to 
debtors’ prison, and dies in Bedlam, the London insane asylum.) 
This scene is set in a famous London brothel, The Rose Tavern. 
The young woman adjusting her shoe in the foreground is a strip¬ 
per preparing for a vulgar dance involving the mirrorlike silver 
plate and the candle behind her; to the left, a chamber pot spills its 
foul contents over a chicken dish; and in the background, a singer 
holds sheet music for a bawdy song of the day. A candle held to a 
map on the back wall indicates that Tom’s world will burn—as did 
Nero’s, the only Roman emperor whose image is not defaced in 
the paintings in the room. The scene is full of witty visual clues to 
its overall meaning, which the viewer would discover little by 
little, adding a comic element to this satire of social evils. 

Hogarth combines Watteau’s sparkling color with Jacob 
Jordaens’s or Jan Steen’s emphasis on narrative (see figs. 22.1,20.9, 
and 20.33). Hogarth’s moral narratives are so entertaining and 
popular that viewers can enjoy his sermon without being over¬ 
whelmed by the stern message. Of course, the “progress” of the 
rake was really his downfall. This series was the counterpart to 
Hogarth’s earlier set, The Harlot's Progress (1731), where an inno¬ 
cent girl, Molly Hackabout, upon comes to the city and is tricked 
into becoming a prostitute, which leads to her demise.

After executing the paintings, Hogarth made prints to sell 
to the public. For The Rake's Progress , he made the prints only 
after the passing of the Engravers Copyright Act of 1735 which 
provided protection from the many imitators who sought to 
copy his works (see The Art Historian's Lens , page 747 for other 
artists’ concerns about counterfeiters). Prints made Hogarth a 
wealthy man. 

Canaletto 

The paintings of the Venetian artist Canaletto (Giovanni Antonio 
Canal, 1697-1768), known for his vedute (meaning “view” paint¬ 
ings) were especially popular with the British, particularly young 
men on the Grand Tour (planned trips through western Europe to 
complete their education) after their formal schooling. They 
brought these scenes of Venice (and elsewhere) home as souvenirs. 
This new form of subject can be traced back to the seventeenth 
century, when many foreign artists, such as Claude Lorrain (see 
fig. 21.8), specialized in depicting the Roman countryside, or to 
the Haarlempjes , the local Dutch landscapes of Ruisdael (see fig. 
20.28). After 1720, however, vedute took on a specifically urban 
identity, focusing more narrowly on buildings or cityscapes. 
During the eighteenth century, landscape painting in Italy evolved 
into a new form in keeping with the character of the Rococo.

The Royal Collection, copyright Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 


The Bucintoro at the Molo (fig. 22.15) is one of a series of 
paintings of Venice commissioned by Joseph Smith, an English 
entrepreneur (later named British consul to Venice) living there. 
Smith then issued the paintings as a suite of etchings to meet the 
demand for mementos of Venice from those who could not afford 
an original canvas by the artist. This work shows a favorite 
subject: the Doge returning on his magnificent barge to the Piazza 
San Marco from the Lido (the city’s island beach) on Ascension 
Day after celebrating the Marriage of the Sea. Canaletto has 
captured the pageantry of this great public festival, which is 
presented as a brilliant theatrical display. 

Canaletto s landscapes are, for the most part, topographically 
accurate. However, he usually made slight adjustments for the 
sake of the composition, and sometimes treated scenes with 
greater freedom or created composite views. He may have used a 
mechanical or optical device, perhaps a camera obscura , a forerun¬ 
ner of the photographic camera (see page 732), to render some of 
his views. The liveliness and sparkle of his pictures, as well as his 
sure sense of composition, sprang in large part from his training 
as a scenographer (a painter of stage sets for operas—including 
those by Antonio Vivaldi, 1678-1741). As in our example, 
Canaletto often included vignettes of daily life in Venice that lend 
greater human interest to his scenes and make them fascinating 
cultural documents as well. 


Canaletto later became one of several Venetian artists to spend 
long sojourns in London, where he created views of the city’s 
new skyline dotted with the church towers of Wren (see page 
755). Other Venetian artists, such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 
(see page 781) and painters from his workshop had significant 
careers outside of Italy, in Germany and Austria, where the 
Rococo flourished. 

THE ROCOCO IN CENTRAL EUROPE 

Rococo architecture was a refinement in miniature of the curvilin¬ 
ear, “elastic” Baroque of Borromini and Guarini. It was readily 
united with the architecture of central Europe, where the Italian 
Baroque had firmly taken root. It is not surprising that the Italian 
style received such a warm response there. In Austria and south¬ 
ern Germany, ravaged by the Thirty Years’ War, patronage for 
the arts was limited and the number of new buildings remained 
small until near the end of the seventeenth century. The Baroque 
here was an imported style, practiced mainly by visiting Italian 
artists. Not until the 1690s did native architects come to the fore. 
By the eighteenth century, however, these countries, especially 
the Catholic parts, were beginning to rebuild on a larger scale. 
A period of intense building activity in the first half of the 


776 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO

eighteenth century gave rise to some of the most imaginative 
creations in the history of architecture. These monuments were 
built to glorify princes and prelates, who are generally remem¬ 
bered now only as lavish patrons of the arts. Rococo architecture 
in central Europe is larger in scale and more exuberant than that 
in France. Moreover, painting and sculpture are more closely 
linked with their settings. Palaces and churches are decorated with 
ceiling frescoes and sculpture unsuited to domestic interiors, 
however lavish, although they reflect the same taste that produced 
the Rococo French hotels. 


Johann Fischer von Erlach 

The Austrian Johann Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723), the first 
important architect of the Rococo in central Europe, studied in 
Rome and was closely linked to the Italian tradition. His work 
represents the decisive shift of the center of architecture from 
Italy to north of the Alps. Fie is best known for the Karlskirche 
(the church of St. Charles Borromeo, literally “Charles s church”) 
in Vienna (figs. 22.16 and 22.17), built in thanks for the ending of 
the plague of 1713, much like the church of Santa Maria della

Italian and French architectural features to new effect, combining 
the facade of Borromini s Sant’Agnese and the Pantheon portico 
(see figs. 19.23 and 7.23). He added a pair of huge columns, 
derived from the Column of Trajan (see fig. 7.39) and decorated 


with scenes from the life of the saint. The two columns symbolize 
the Pillars of Hercules—the Straits of Gibraltar—a reference to 
Charles Vis claim to the throne of Spain. They also take the place 
of towers, which have become corner pavilions reminiscent of 
Lescots Louvre court facade (see fig. 18.2). The church proclaims 
the emperor Charles VI as a Christian ruler and assures us of his 
domination over the Turks, who repeatedly menaced Austria and 
Hungary. They had been defeated only recently—at the Siege of 


778 PART III THE RENAISSANCE THROUGH ROCOCO 








Vienna in 1683—but only with the aid of John III of Poland. The 
Turks remained a serious threat as late as 1718. 

Fischer von Erlach uses aspects of major works of the canon 
of Western architecture here to create an entirely new work that 
brings with it all the grandeur and esteem of the old traditions. 
The extraordinary breadth of this architectural ensemble is due 
to the site itself (see fig. 22.16), which obscures the equally long 
main body of the church. With the inflexible elements of Roman 
imperial art embedded into the elastic curves of his church, 
Fischer von Erlach expresses, more boldly than any Italian archi¬ 
tect of the time, the power of the Christian faith to transform the 
art of antiquity. 


Egid Quirin Asam 

The Rococo made stirring claims in the heart of southern 
Germany—Bavaria—where new buildings or renovations of old 
ones transformed churches into extravagant liturgical stage sets. 
Egid Quirin Asam (1692-1750) and his brother, Cosmas Damian 
Asam (1686-1739), were responsible for the complete design and 
decoration of several churches and palaces in Bavaria. The broth¬ 
ers traveled to Rome (1711-13) where they studied the works of 
Bernini and his influence in their work is palpable. 

Egid Quirin Asam s magnificent contribution to the renova¬ 
tion of the Benedictine abbey at Rohr (his brother was to execute 
paintings here, but they were never completed) reveals a clear 
debt to the Roman Baroque master. The original Romanesque 
church had been remodeled several times before the eighteenth 
century, but Asam completely transformed the interior. The main 
altar is set as a stage with larger than life-size stucco figures 
depicting The Assumption of the Virgin (fig. 22.18). The Virgin 
with the help of angels ascends into the golden heavens (the dome 
lit by windows), welcomed by the Trinity in the clouds as the 
white stuccoed apostles who surround her open sarcophagus (the 
huge lid is standing on the right) gesticulate wildly in amazement 
at this miracle. Their grand, broad gestures fill the space and are 
mirrored by the Virgin s own outstretched arms and fluttering 
fabrics. The scene is set before a flowing blue-gold curtain and 
framed by four columns. It is as if Bernini s Ecstasy of St. Teresa 
(see fig. 19.31) has met his Baldacchino and Cathedra Petri (see fig. 
19.15). The lightness of the stucco (rather than marble) allowed 
for the use of wires and supports to raise the Virgin and to sup¬ 
port the extended arms of the saints. The ensemble of exaggerated 
drama from the tomb to the golden heavens is an extravagant 
fulfillment of the Baroque in the eighteenth century. 


Dominikus Zimmermann 

Dominikus Zimmermann (1685-1766) created what may be the 
finest architectural design of the mid-eighteenth century: the rural 
Bavarian pilgrimage church nicknamed “ Die Wies ” (“The 
Meadow”). The exterior is so plain that by comparison the inte¬ 
rior seems overwhelming (figs. 22.19 and 22.20). This richness 
reflects the fact that the architect and his brother, Johann Baptist

Zimmermann (1680-1758), who was responsible for the frescoes, 
trained initially as stucco workers. The interior design includes a 
combination of sculptural painted stucco decoration and painting. 
Like Fischer von Erlach s Karlskirche, the church s basic shape is 
oval. Yet because the ceiling rests on paired, free-standing sup¬ 
ports, the space is more fluid and complex, recalling a German 
Gothic Hallenkirche (hall church). Even the way the Rococo 
decor tends to break up the ceiling recalls the webbed vaults of the 
Gothic Heiligenkreuz in Schwabisch-Gmiind (see fig. 12.56). 
Here Guarini s prophetic reevaluation of Gothic architecture has 
become reality. 


Balthasar Neumann 

The work of Balthasar Neumann (1687-1753), a contemporary of 
Zimmerman s who designed buildings exuding lightness and ele¬ 
gance, represents one of the high points of the Rococo in central 
Europe. Trained as a military engineer, he was named a surveyor 
for the Residenz (Episcopal Palace) in Wurzburg after his return 
from a visit to Milan in 1720. Although the basic plan was already 
established, Neumann was required to consult the leading architects 
of Paris and Vienna in 1723 before he made his extensive modifi¬ 
cations. The final result is a skillful blend of the latest German, 
French, and Italian ideas. The breathtaking Kaisersaal (fig. 22.21)

is a great oval hall decorated in the favorite color scheme of the 
mid-eighteenth century: white, gold, and pastel shades. The struc¬ 
tural importance of the columns, pilasters, and architraves has 
been minimized in favor of their decorative role. Windows and 
vault segments are framed by continuous, ribbonlike moldings, 
and the white surfaces are covered with irregular ornamental 
designs. These lacy, curling motifs, the hallmark of the French 
style (see fig. 22.11), are happily combined with German Rococo 
architecture. (The basic design recalls an early interior by Fischer 
von Erlach.) But it is the painted decoration that completes the 
rich organic structure. The abundant daylight, the play of curves 
and countercurves, and the weightless grace of the stucco sculp¬ 
ture give the Kaisersaal an airy lightness far removed from the 
Roman Baroque. The vaults and walls seem thin and pliable, like 
membranes easily punctured by the expansive power of space. 

Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Illusionistic 
Ceiling Decoration 

Central European Rococo churches and palaces required paint¬ 
ings to complement the architecture and achieve the full effect of 
extensive, overwhelming, yet light decoration (through the use of 


white, gold trim, and pastel colors). Venetian colorists with a 
revived appreciation of Veronese s colorism and pageantry, but 
with an airy sensibility that is new, were skilled in the Baroque 
illusionism of the previous century and were able to adapt it to 
Rococo architecture. They were active in every major center 
throughout Europe, especially in London, Dresden, and Madrid. 
And the most sought-after of these Venetian artists—both in 
Venice and throughout central Europe in the eighteenth cen¬ 
tury—was Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1696-1770). 

The last and most refined stage of Italian illusionistic ceiling 
decoration can be seen in the works of Tiepolo, who spent most 
of his life in Venice, where his works defined the Rococo style. 
Tiepolo spent two years in Germany, and in the last years of his 
life he worked for Charles III in Spain. His mastery of light and 
color, his grace and masterful touch, and his power of invention 
made him famous far beyond his home territory. When Tiepolo 
painted the Wurzburg frescoes (figs. 22.22 and 22.23), his powers 
were at their height. The tissuelike ceiling gives way so often to 
illusionistic openings, both painted and sculpted, that it no longer 
feels like a spatial boundary. Unlike Baroque ceilings (see figs. 
19.11 and 19.12), these openings do not reveal avalanches of fig¬ 
ures propelled by dramatic bursts of light. Rather, pale blue skies 


CHAPTER 22 THE ROCOCO 781

and sunlit clouds are dotted with an occasional winged creature 
soaring in the limitless expanse. Only along the edges of the 
ceiling do solid clusters of figures appear. 

At one end, replacing a window, is The Marriage of Frederick 
Barharossa (see fig. 22.23). As a public spectacle, it is as festive as 
The Feast in the FFouse of Levi by Veronese (see fig. 17.38). The 
artist has followed Veroneses example by putting the event, 
which took place in the twelfth century, in a contemporary set¬ 
ting. Its allegorical fantasy is “revealed” by the carved putti open¬ 
ing a gilt-stucco curtain onto the wedding ceremony in a display 


of theatrical illusionism worthy of Bernini. Indeed, it parallels the 
drama orchestrated by Egid Quirin Asam at Rohr (see fig. 22.18). 
Unexpected in this festive procession is the element of classicism, 
which gives an air of noble restraint to the main figures, in keep¬ 
ing with the solemnity of the occasion. 

Tiepolo later became the last in the long line of Italian artists 
who were invited to work at the Royal Court in Madrid where he 
worked for Charles III. There, he encountered the German 
painter Anton Raphael Mengs, a champion of the classical revival, 
whose presence signaled the end of the Rococo.

Art in the Age 
of the Enlightenment, 

1750-1789 


A most remarkable change in our ideas is taking place, one of such rapidity that it 
seems to promise a greater change still to come. It will he for the juture to decide the aim, 
the nature, and the limits of this revolution, the drawbacks and disadvantages of which 

posterity will he able to judge better than we can. 

—Jean d’Alembert 


W HEN THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER AND SCIENTIST JEAN 

d’Alembert made this prophetic statement in 1759, the Western 
world was indeed embarking on a revolution, one that is still 
unfolding today. This revolution ushered in a radically new way of 
viewing the world, one that would lead to the social, scientific, economic, and 


political values that govern our present lives. Little did d’Alembert 
realize that he was witnessing the birth of the modern world. 

This new world was heralded by twin revolutions: the 
Industrial Revolution, which began first in Britain in the middle 
of the eighteenth century and gradually spread worldwide in the 
nineteenth century; and the political revolutions of the United 
States and France in 1776 and 1789, respectively. Democracy, 
personal liberty, capitalism, socialism, industrialization, techno¬ 
logical innovation, urbanization, and the “doctrine of progress,” 
that is, a continuous upward march toward an improved life 
through science and knowledge, are just some of the many mod¬ 
ern concepts that emerged from this period. 

The force behind this transformation was the Enlightenment, 
a term that refers to the modern philosophy that emerged largely 
in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States in the eigh¬ 
teenth century. The foundation for this new thought lay in late 
seventeenth-century Britain with the philosopher John Locke 
(1632-1704) and the physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton 
(1642-1727), perhaps the two most influential thinkers of their

age. Both stressed empiricism—the idea that knowledge comes 
from practical experience rather than abstract thought or religious 
revelation—as the basis for philosophy and science. For Newton, 
this meant proceeding from personally collected data and obser¬ 
vation—not superstition, mysticism, religion, hearsay, or 
whimsy—and applying this information in a rational, logical 
fashion. For Locke, empiricism established experience as the only 
basis for formulating theory and principle. No longer could ideas 
be considered innate or ordained by God. Locke upset the 
applecart of Original Sin when he declared that all humans are 
born good and have a natural right to life, liberty, and property. 
He defined the function of government as the protection of these 
natural rights, and failure to do so granted citizens the license to 
remove their government, even if that required revolution. 

What began as a trickle of influence evolved into a torrent as 
the basic premises behind the innovative ideas of Locke and 
Newton produced an explosion of treatises and theories through¬ 
out the eighteenth century. Leading this philosophical charge 
were the philosophies, as the leading French intellectuals of the 
time are commonly called. Among the best known are Voltaire 
(1694-1778), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), and Denis 
Diderot (1713-1784), who, along with d’Alembert, edited the 52- 
volume Encyclopedic , the world’s first encyclopedia, which in its

attempt to document the world and knowledge epitomizes 
Enlightenment empiricism. 

In addition to establishing basic human rights and a new moral 
order, Enlightenment thought also ushered in modern science. 
Electricity and oxygen were discovered, for example, and chem¬ 
istry and natural science as we know it today were established. 
Science helped launch the Industrial Revolution. By midcentury, 
the first mills were churning out yards of fabric at an unimagin¬ 
able rate in the Midlands of England, and the notion of labor was 
redefined as the first factory workers, employed at subsistence 
wages, were tethered to clattering looms in enormous spaces filled 
with deafening noise. Miners excavated coal and ore to produce 
iron, permitting construction of the first metal bridge. Perfection 
of the steam engine by Scottish engineer James Watt from 1765 to 
1782 aided the mining and textile industries and enabled Robert 
Fulton, in 1807, to send a steamboat chugging up the Hudson 
River in the face of a swift current and public incredulity, arriving 
in Albany from Manhattan in unimaginably quick time. 

The second half of the eighteenth century was a period of 
transition as the world moved from the old to the modern, from 
rule by aristocracy and church to democracy, from agriculture to 
industry, and from rural to urban. The art of this time reflects this 
transformation, for it is often changing and complex, with several 
almost contradictory attitudes existing in a single work. The 
dominant style associated with this transitional period is 
Neoclassicism, meaning the “New Classicism,” which often illus¬ 
trated what were considered the virtuous actions and deeds of the 


ancient Greeks and Romans. As we shall see, however, not all 
works labeled Neoclassical are set in historical antiquity; they 
may be contemporary genre scenes or major events that have the 
look or feel of classical antiquity and that embrace similar moral 
values. 

Neoclassicism embraced the logic and morality of the 
Enlightenment, which were perhaps best encapsulated in the 
works of Voltaire. In his plays, poems, novels, and tracts, Voltaire 
used logic to attack what he called “persecuting and privileged 
orthodoxy,” mainly meaning Church and State, but any illogical 
institution or concept was fair game for his satire. He believed sci¬ 
ence could advance civilization and that logic presumed a govern¬ 
ment that benefitted the people, not just the aristocracy. It is from 
Voltaire that we get the “doctrine of progress.” The models for 
Voltaire s new civilization were the republics of ancient Greece 
and Rome, which in addition to being the first democracies 
provided the first rationalist philosophers. Taking its vocabulary 
directly from ancient art, Neoclassicism would reject the sensual 
pastel colors and bold painterly flourishes of the Rococo and 
instead return to the hard line and cool paint handling of the 
Italian Renaissance (see Chapters 15, 16, and 17) and French 
Classicism (see Chapter 21). 

While Neoclassicism is the style generally associated with the 
second half of the eighteenth century, simultaneously, a second 
and seemingly antithetical thread appears in art: Romanticism. 
As we shall see in the next chapter, Romanticism really comes of 
age about 1800, when the term was actually coined in order to 


786 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




























describe the sweeping changes in worldview then occurring. 
Instead of Neoclassicism s logic and its desire to control the forces 
of nature through science, Romanticism values emotion and intu¬ 
ition and believes in the supremacy of raw, unrestricted nature. 
Like Neoclassicism, however, early Romanticism often stems 
from Enlightenment thought, in particular its emphasis on moral¬ 
ity. Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the principal proponent of this view, 
which he articulated in his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences 
(1750). Here, he advocated a return to nature, arguing, like Locke, 
that humans are born good, not in sin, and that they use their 
innate sense or instincts to distinguish between good and bad, that 
is, between what makes them happy and sad. Feeling determines 
their choices, not rational thought, which one uses to explain 
choices, not to make them. Society, he believed, through its 
mores, values, and conventions, eventually imposes its own 
rationalized standards on humans, distracting them from their 
first true and natural instincts. Rousseau praised what he called 
the sincere “noble savage,” steeped in nature, and he denounced 
contemporary Western civilization for its pretensions, artificiality, 
and, in general, for those social restraints that prevent us from 
tapping into the power of our basic emotions. 

Rousseau, in turn, inspired the German proto-romantic 
movement known as Sturm und Drang and conventionally trans¬ 
lated as “Storm and Stress,” although “Passion and Energy” or 
“Energy and Rebellion” is perhaps more accurate. This literary 
movement, which centered on the Weimar region, appeared from 
roughly the late 1760s through the early 1780s. Its best-known 
representative was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), 
author of The Sorrows ofYoung Werther (1774), one of the most 
widely read novels of its day. Like Rousseau, the group supported 
personal freedom, which in part was a reaction to the repressive 
despotism of the German states and of contemporary moral and 
social conventions. Similarly, the movement advocated powerful 
emotions and extreme passion as an expression of the unique, 
creative individual, and it likewise called for a return to nature, 
a pre-civilization state. 

While Neoclassicism is the style generally associated with the 
period, we must remember that the rational and the emotional 
survived side by side in art, flip sides of the same Enlightenment 
coin. Proponents of both attitudes aggressively rejected Rococo 
art (see Chapter 22), which they perceived as licentious, frivolous, 
even immoral, and which was generally associated with aristoc¬ 
racy and privilege, the twin evils condemned by the Enlighten¬ 
ment. While there was a call for a new art, one based on Classical 
values, no one was sure what it should look like. Not until the 
1780s, with the paintings of Jacques-Louis David and the sculp¬ 
ture of Antonio Canova, did the Neoclassical style crystallize. 
In the meantime, Neoclassicism would appear in many guises, 
sometimes even containing elements of Rococo elegance, a 
reminder that the Rococo still survived—Boucher did not die 
until 1771, and Fragonard and Clodion lived on into the nine¬ 
teenth century. Simultaneously, the Romantic fascination with 
strong emotions, with the irrational and unexplainable, and 
with the powerful forces of nature, was developing, which 


ironically would overshadow Neoclassicism by the 1790s, the 
decade following David s and Canova s rise as well as the French 
Revolution of 1789. While Britain and France dominate art in the 
second half of the century and are the focus of our discussion, 
Neoclassicism, like the Enlightenment, was an international 
movement, well represented in Scandinavia, Austria, Germany, 
and Russia. 

ROME TOWARD 1 760: 

THE FONT OF NEOCLASSICISM 

Rome was the center of the art world in the eighteenth century, 
and virtually anyone aspiring to become a painter, sculptor, or 
architect wanted to study there, experiencing first hand the antiq¬ 
uities of Greece and Rome and the riches of the Renaissance and 
Baroque periods. Not just artists came to Rome, for no gentle¬ 
man s education was complete without making a “Grand Tour” of 
Italy, including the North Country (Florence, Tuscany, Umbria, 
and Venice) and Naples, the jumping-off point for Herculaneum 
and Pompeii, perfectly preserved Roman cities that were in the 
process of being excavated from 1738 and 1748, respectively. 
These archaeological excavations, as well as those in Athens 
(of the Akropolis, 1751), Palmyra (1753), Baalbek (1757), Split 
(Spalato, 1757), and Ionia (1764), fueled an interest in antiquity 
and fired the imagination of artists, largely through illustrations 
published in lavish folio format. But the climax of the Grand Tour 
was Rome, which was itself one large excavation site, with antiq¬ 
uities dealers furiously digging for artifacts and sculpture to sell 
to tourists. 

Equally responsible for creating a renewed preoccupation 
with antiquity were the writings of the German scholar Johann 
Winckelmann (1717-1768, see page 157), librarian to the great 
antiquities collector Cardinal Albani, whose Villa Albani in Rome 
was one of the antiquities museums—along with the Villa 
Borghese and the Capitoline Hill—that every gentleman on the 
Grand Tour had to visit. In 1755, Winckelmann published 
Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Art in Painting and Sculpture , 
and in 1765, he produced his magnum opus , History of Greek Art. 
The latter was one of the most widely read books of its day, which 
accounts for its influence. In both publications, Winckelmann ele¬ 
vated Greek culture to a position of supremacy it never quite held 
in the Classical tradition: an era of perfection that was followed 
only by imitation and decline. But Winckelmann did not just see 
beauty in Greek art; he also saw moral qualities that paralleled 
Enlightenment thought: “the general and predominant mark of 
Greek masterpieces is noble simplicity and calm grandeur , both in 
gesture and in expression. The expression of all Greek statues 
reveals even in the midst of all passions a great and grave soul 
[italics added]. ” He concludes that “the only way for us to become 
great, and if possible, even inimitable, is through imitation of the 
ancients.” In response to Winckelmann s influence, the rallying 
cry of Neoclassicism would be the creation of moral works 
embodying “noble simplicity and calm grandeur. ” 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 787 



Artistic Foundations of Neoclassicism: 

Mengs and Hamilton 

Influenced by the revived interest in antiquity, two artists work¬ 
ing in Rome began to lay the foundation for Neoclassicism: 
Anton Raphael Mengs (1728-1779) and the Scottish painter 
Gavin Hamilton (1723-1798). Mengs, a German who worked in 
Rome on and off from 1740 to 1765, gained notoriety when 
Cardinal Albani, at Winckelmann s urging, commissioned him to 
paint a ceiling fresco for the Villa Albani. Completed in 1761 and 
with Winckelmann assisting with the iconography, his Parnassus 
(fig. 23.1) depicts the cardinal as Apollo surrounded by the seven 
female Muses, most of whom can be identified as the cardinal s 
friends. The composition is based on Raphaels Vatican fresco of 
the same title. Stylistically, Mengs drew on Raphael, as well as 
ancient sources. His painting combines Raphaels planarity 
(objects and figures are parallel to the picture plane) and linearity 
(objects and figures have crisply drawn contours). The figures 
themselves are copied from Raphael and from the recently 
unearthed murals at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Apollo s pose 
recalls the Apollo Belvedere (see page 157), a work in the Vatican 
collection and made famous by Winckelmann. For the sake of 


planarity, Mengs dispensed with the Baroque device of an illu- 
sionistic ceiling (see fig. 19.10), one that opens up to the sky. 
Instead he made his ceiling look like a wall painting by Raphael, 
simply hung on a ceiling. He also daringly replaced the lush 
Rococo brushwork then in fashion (see page 766) with tight 
brushwork that dissolves into a smooth, hard surface. An even 
lighting models solid, three-dimensional forms. All of these 
elements—planarity, linearity, tight brushwork, even lighting, 
sculptural forms, and Classical figures and themes—played a 
prominent role in the development of the Neoclassical style. 

The one element absent from Mengs s painting that would 
be crucial for the development of Neoclassicism is an austere, 
moralistic subject, such as a scene of self-sacrifice. This missing 
ingredient was provided by the painter and antiquities dealer 
Gavin Hamilton, who in the early 1760s began painting deathbed 
scenes, such as Andromache Bewailing the Death of Hector (ca. 
1761), a subject taken from Homer showing Andromache bent 
over the body of her husband, Hector, the Trojan leader who had 
been killed by the Greek Achilles. The painting was reproduced 
in a widely circulated engraving of 1764 (fig. 23.2), a reminder of 
the importance of prints in giving currency to images before the 
invention of photography, as well as an additional way for artists

to earn a living. Everyone who went to Rome would have seen 
this picture in Hamilton’s studio, since at the time he was one of 
the must-see painters. For those who did not get to see the work 
in Rome, it was available for viewing at a 1764 exhibition of the 
Society of Artists in London, an organization providing an annual 
exhibition for members and considered the premier venue in the 
British capital until the Royal Academy opened in 1768. This 
painting of mourning must have shocked eyes accustomed to 
Rococo gaiety, fantasy, and pleasure. Its moral is matrimonial 
devotion as opposed to marital indiscretion, unwavering dedica¬ 
tion rather than titillating deception, virtue not vice. Elements of 
the composition were inspired by reliefs on Roman sarcophagi 
and sepulchral buildings, but Hamilton’s prime source was 
Poussins Death of Germanicus (see fig. 21.4), which was then 
in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The two pictures share the 
receding barrel vault on the left and the same planar composition 
established by the lateral spread of the bed with canopy and 
recumbent body. Hamilton would paint other works on the 
themes of virtue and moral fortitude, and while he was not the 
first to reintroduce themes that had been of extreme importance 
to artists until the advent of the Rococo, his pictures seem to have 
been a catalyst. Increasingly in the 1760s and 1770s, artists in all 
mediums turned to this kind of moralistic subject matter. 

ROMANTICISM IN ROME: PIRANESI 

As discussed in the introduction, Neoclassicism was not the only 
movement to evolve after 1750. Concurrently, the first signs of a 
Romantic spirit were emerging, a spirit that evoked strong emo¬ 
tional responses from the viewer. In Rome, the source of this 


current was Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), a printmaker 
who would have a powerful impact on eighteenth-century artists, 
especially architects, as we shall see. By the 1750s, Piranesi was 
renowned for his vedute , or views, of Rome, which gentlemen on 
the Grand Tour took home as souvenirs of their visit. (In Venice, 
they would buy vedute by Canaletto and other artists—see page 
775.) Winckelmann’s glorification of the Greeks and belittling of 
the Romans had infuriated Piranesi, who set out to defend his 
Roman heritage by producing Roman Antiquities , a four-volume 
work completed in 1757 and illustrated with several hundred 
etchings of Roman ruins. These etchings are hardly mere docu¬ 
mentation of sites in and around Rome. Often presenting worm s- 
eye views of the structures (fig. 23.3), Piranesi transformed them 
into colossal, looming monuments that not only attested to the 
Herculean engineering feats of the ancient Romans but also the 
uncontested might and supremacy of Roman civilization. The 
frightening scale of the monuments dwarfs the awestruck tourists 
who walk among the dramatically lit ruins. These structures seem 
erected not by mere humans, but by a civilization of towering 
giants who mysteriously vanished. Time, however, has taken a toll 
on their monuments, now crumbling and picturesquely covered 
by plants. Tourists such as Goethe, who before only knew Rome 
from Piranesi’s vedute , were shocked to discover how small the 
ruins actually were upon seeing them for the first time. 

These images embody Piranesi’s own sense of awe in the face 
of Roman civilization and constitute a melancholic meditation on 
the destructive ability of time to erode that once-great empire. 
The prints are not intended just to inform; they are also meant to 
evoke a sense of astonishment, even fright. In them we see the 
beginnings of a sensitivity that is antithetical in spirit to the noble 
simplicity and calm grandeur of Neoclassicism.

Before the eighteenth century was out, the sense of awe that 
Piranesi produced would be identified as being caused by what 
the period called the “sublime. ” The sublime is not a style, but a 
quality or attribute. Interestingly, the word became current in 
1756, a year before Piranesi s publication, when the British states¬ 
man Edmund Burke (1729-1797) published a treatise titled A 
Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime 
and Beautiful. Burke s study was directed more toward psychol¬ 
ogy than aesthetics, but its impact on the world of art was 
tremendous. He defined beauty as embodying such qualities as 
smoothness, delicacy, and grace, which produced feelings of joy, 
pleasure, and love. The sublime he defined as obscurity, darkness, 
power, vastness, and infinity, anything that generated feelings of 
fright, terror, being overwhelmed, and awe. The sublime, he 
wrote, produced “the strongest emotion which the mind is capa¬ 
ble of feeling. ” As the century progressed, more and more artists 
embraced this quality, catering to viewers 5 demands to be awed or 
moved by paintings, sculpture, and architecture. 


NEOCLASSICISM IN BRITAIN 

It almost seems as though the British were predisposed to 
embracing Neoclassicism, not only because the birth of 
Enlightenment occurred in Britain but also because the nation 
already had an intense involvement with antiquity in literature, 
which dated to the opening decades of the eighteenth century The 
Augustan or Classical Age of British poetry was in full bloom by 
then, with its leading authors, such as John Dryden, Alexander 
Pope, and Samuel Johnson, emulating the form and content of the 
writers active during the reign of the first Roman emperor, 
Augustus Caesar (63 BCE-14 ce), many of whose works these 
same British poets translated. Britain at this time was enjoying 
unprecedented peace and prosperity which, in part, was respon¬ 
sible for the identification with Augustus Caesar s reign, similarly 
marked by stability economic success, and the flourishing of cul¬ 
ture. The liberal faction of the British aristocracy modeled itself 
on ancient Rome, relating the British parliamentary government 


790 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 
















































that shared power with the king to the democracy of the Roman 
Republic. As we shall see, by the 1720s, these liberals, who 
compared themselves with Roman senators, had come to desire 
country homes based on Roman prototypes. 

Sculpture and Painting: 

Historicism, Morality, and Antiquity 

The British were particularly receptive to the Neoclassical foun¬ 
dation established by Mengs and Hamilton. Hamilton’s moralis¬ 
tic antique scenes in particular had a major impact, and the list of 
artists inspired by them is extensive, starting with a handful in the 
1760s and extending to dozens more in the following decades. 
However, the taste for the classical could also be just that, a taste 
for a style or look, with little consideration for the underlying 
moral message. This was especially true in the decorative arts (see 
Materials and Techniques , page 792). 

THOMAS BANKS Hamilton’s impact was so great it extended 
beyond painting to sculpture, as seen in the work of Thomas 
Banks (1735-1805). From 1772 to 1779 Banks studied in Rome, 
where he chiseled a marble relief of The Death ofGermanicus (fig. 
23.4). Reflecting the Enlightenment emphasis on logic and credi¬ 
bility, Banks authenticated his scene by making his setting as real 
and as historical as possible, using archaeologically correct archi¬ 
tectural details and furniture (note the klismos chair, for instance, 
which was especially popular in the fifth century BCE). To make 
his image more antique, he aligned his Classical figures in a flat, 
shallow frieze composition, idealizing faces and putting them in 
Greek profile. The unusual stance of the soldier on the far right is 
a mourning pose that Banks copied from Roman reliefs. As in 
Hamilton’s Andromache Bewailing the Death of Hector , the 
devoted women and children express intense sorrow for the dying 
general, while the dedicated soldiers, with raised oath-swearing 
arms, probably inspired by Hamilton’s 1763-64 Oath of Brutus, 
vow to avenge his murder. Similarly sweeping curves augment the 
intense emotion of both groups, although Hamilton’s figures, 
especially Andromache, appear to imitate the explosive monu- 
mentality of Michelangelo’s sibyls and prophets. As we shall see, 
Neoclassicism, in its climax in France in the 1780s, will abandon 
curvilinear design and embrace a severe geometric grid that 
underscores the intense moralistic resolve of the figures. 

ANGELICA KAUFFMANN Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807) 
was among the most important artists for the development of 
Neoclassicism in Britain. She was born in Switzerland, studied in 
Rome in the 1760s, and moved to London in 1766. She befriended 
Joshua Reynolds, who was to become the first president of the 
Royal Academy when it was founded in 1768, and she herself was 
a founding member. Prior to the twentieth century, she was one 
of only two women admitted into the academy. As a woman, she 
was denied access to studying the male nude, then considered crit¬ 
ical to a history painter’s success, which makes her accomplish¬ 
ments all the more remarkable. Of the few eighteenth-century

women artists to carve out a successful career in a man’s world, 
Kauffmann was the only one who became a history painter. The 
others were either still-life painters, like the Parisian Anne 
Vallayer-Coster (1744-1818), or portraitists, like Marie-Louise- 
Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun (see page 816), who was the French queen 
Marie-Antoinette’s favorite artist, and Adelaide Labille-Guiard 
(1749-1803). Male prejudice was so strong against the latter two 
French women, both of whom rank among the finest painters of 
the period, that they were accused of employing men to make 
their works. Enlightenment philosophy, with its emphasis on 
equality, may have provided a theoretical premise for greater 
social, economic, and political freedom for women, but in reality 
female artists remained second-class citizens throughout the eigh¬ 
teenth century, only occasionally gaining access to the academies 
in London and Paris (the French Academy only allowed four 
women members at a time). Furthermore, male artists continued 
to depict women stereotypically, as wives and mothers who in 
addition to being fertile and pretty are helpless, passive, grieving, 
and immobile, as we saw in Hamilton’s Andromache Bewailing 
the Death of Hector And Banks’s The Death ofGermanicus. 

Like so many of her contemporaries, Kauffmann raided Greek 
and Roman literature for her subjects. In 1769, at the first Royal 
Academy exhibition, she presented Hector Taking Leave of 
Andromache , and three years later she showed Andromache and 
Hecuba Weeping over the Ashes of Hector , two pictures portray¬ 
ing unwavering marital fidelity. A classic example of Kauffmann’s 
moralistic pictures is Cornelia Presenting Her Children as Her 
Treasures (Mother of the Gracchi) (fig. 23.5) of about 1785. Here 
she champions child-rearing and family duty over materialism. 
While portraying a woman as a mother, she nonetheless coun¬ 
ters traditional male stereotyping by presenting her subject as 
proactive and in control. In this second-century BCE story from

Josiah Wedgwood and Neoclassical Jasperware 


R eflecting the rising demand in Britain for all things Classical 
was jasperware porcelain, invented by Josiah Wedgwood and 
produced by the mid-1 770s in his factory named Etruria in 
Staffordshire. Jasperware is a durable, unglazed porcelain dec¬ 
orated with Classically inspired bas-relief (low-relief) or cameo 
figures. Most jasperware is ornamented in white relief on a 
colored ground, especially blue and sage green. In 1 775, 
Wedgwood hired the sculptor John Flaxman (1 75 5-1 826) to pro¬ 
duce many of his designs, which were largely based on ancient 
Greek vases in the collection of William Hamilton. The Greek 
vases, not discovered until the middle of the eighteenth century, 
were considered Etruscan, hence the name Etruria for 
Wedgwood’s plant. Hamilton’s collection, housed in Naples 
and sold to the newly founded British Museum in 1 772, was 
published in enormous folio volumes in the 1 760s and readily 
available for copying. 

Reproduced here is a Flaxman vase depicting Hercules in the 
Garden of the Hesperides, designed in 1 785, although not pro¬ 
duced until later. Flaxman translated the two-dimensional draw¬ 
ing on a Hamilton vase into the shallow three-dimensionality 
appropriate for jasperware. While he retained the strong 
contours, profiles, and basic configuration of the figures on 
Hamilton’s vase, he subtly increased the elegance of the origi¬ 
nal Greek design, largely by simplifying the drawing and making 
it more graceful. 

Like most Wedgwood images, the scene is not one of action, 
resolve, or a decisive moment reflecting nobility of character. 
Instead, Flaxman shows Hercules in repose in the garden where 
his eleventh task required him to steal the golden apple belong¬ 
ing to Zeus, which was protected by the multi-headed Hydra and 
the Hesperides, the daughters of Atlas. The image looks more 
like a Classical fete galante than a heroic act of Herculean 
courage and might. The prettiness of the color and delicacy of 
the design echo Rococo sensitivity and are a reminder that the 
taste for the Classical could also be just that, a taste for a style 
or look, with little consideration for a moralistic message, as we 



saw in the Neoclassical images of 
Hamilton, Banks, and Kauffmann. 

The rise of Wedgwood coincided 
with the Industrial Revolution: the 
company was based upon mass pro¬ 
duction. Wedgwood produced the 
same Flaxman design on different 
objects: vases, fireplace panels, 
plaques, medallions, and jardinieres 
(large, ornamental flowerpot hold¬ 
ers). With his partner Thomas 
Bentley, who was responsible for the 
firm’s preoccupation with Classical 
art and for hiring Flaxman, 

Wedgwood opened a showroom in 
London to promote their wares and 
innovatively published a well-distrib¬ 
uted catalogue of their products. 

The two men were not only mass- 
producing art, they were also 
mass-marketing it, making high- 
quality work available to a broad 
public at a reasonable price. They 
also fulfilled a growing public 
infatuation with celebrities, for their 
medallions included portraits of 
famous people, in effect anticipating 
the role of photography some 75 

years later and the mass media in the twentieth century. Flaxman designed 
profiles of such renowned figures as the writer Samuel Johnson and the 
sensation of London, the actress Sarah Siddons. 

The Industrial Revolution was increasing wealth and creating an upper 
middle class in Britain, and Wedgwood was meeting the needs of this new 
clientele—art was no longer just for royalty, the aristocracy, and the church. 
Demand was so great that Wedgwood installed his first steam engine at 
Etruria in the early 1 780s to make his plant more efficient.

Roman history, a visiting friend has just shown off her jewelry to 
Cornelia Gracchus. Instead of displaying her own gems, Cornelia 
proudly presents her children, two of whom, Tiberius and Gaius, 
would become great politicians. To prepare her sons for leader¬ 
ship, Cornelia acquired the finest tutors in the world, and it was 
said that she “weaned” them on conversation, not her breasts. She 
remained an ally and advisor to both, and in addition to her 
reputation for virtue and intelligence, she was one of the most 
powerful women in the history of the Roman Republic. 
Kauffmann, a woman artist struggling in a mans world, must 
have identified with the successful Cornelia, whose features in the 
painting resemble the artist s own. 

In Cornelia Presenting Her Children , Kauffmann has created 
an austere and monumental painting that reinforces the 
strength and nobility of the mother. The picture is dominated 
by the bareness of the floor and walls, the carefully modeled 
statuesque figures, and a stable composition anchored by a solid 
triangle culminating in Cornelia. The Cornelia theme was not 
unique to Kauffmann, but was quite popular with other artists. 
Not only did it illustrate virtue, it also reflected the new interest 
in the importance of the family unit that stemmed from the 


Enlightenment teachings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who advo¬ 
cated that parents should nurture their children at home, rather 
than sending them off to wet nurses and nannies until they were 
adolescents. 

The Birth of Contemporary History Painting 

Enlightenment empiricism had a major impact on history painting 
in two ways. One was the strong emphasis on historicism—when 
portraying a scene set in the historical past, costume, setting, and 
props all had to be convincing and true to the period. The second 
impact affected the presentation of major contemporary events 
that the future would perceive as historically important. Until 
now, such moments had generally been shown using allegory and 
symbols, not by portraying the actual scene, or figures would be 
dressed in Classical garb in order to provide the sense of decorum 
and importance the event apparently required. But with the 
Enlightenment, paintings increasingly had to be logical and real 
and every bit as convincing to contemporaries as we expect period 
films to be today. This applied not only to the historical past but 
to contemporary events as well. 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 793 



BENJAMIN WEST The artist perhaps most responsible for 
popularizing contemporary history painting is Benjamin West 
(1738-1820), one of the most successful British Neoclassical 
history painters. A Quaker born and raised just outside of 
Philadelphia, West went to Rome in 1760 where he studied with 
Mengs, befriended Gavin Hamilton, and immersed himself in 
antiquity and the Classically influenced Renaissance masters, 
especially Raphael. By 1763, he had settled permanently in 
London, and within three years had found success, in part 
because of his innovative handling of Neoclassicism s emerging 
vocabulary. He was a founding member of the Royal Academy in 
1768, and he became its president in 1792 when Joshua Reynolds 
died. Throughout his life, he was a mentor for many American 
artists, and always remained proud of his New World heritage, 
even supporting the American Revolution. (For a discussion of 
art in colonial America, see the Introduction.) 

Among the pictures that established West s reputation are his 
Agrippina with the Ashes ofGermanicus of 1768, a picture that falls 
into the moral category of the dedicated widow, and The 
Departure ofRegulus from Rome from 1769, which reflects the 
stoic self-sacrifice of a Roman general to save his country. 


Employing Enlightenment historicism, the pictures are set in 
convincingly real ancient Roman cities, with figures aligned 
in relief, parallel to the picture plane, against a backdrop of 
Classical buildings. 

West shocked the London art world in 1770 when he 
announced he was working on a contemporary history painting, 
The Death of General Wolfe (fig. 23.6), and placing the event in the 
realistic setting of 1759 Quebec during the French and Indian 
War. Wolfe won the Battle of Quebec, which became a turning 
point in the war and made him a national hero. Upon hearing of 
West s plan, King George III declared he would never purchase a 
picture with his soldiers shown in modern uniforms, and 
Reynolds frowned on the pictures breach of decorum, which 
required an allegorical apotheosis scene. But when exhibited at 
the Royal Academy, the painting was immediately applauded by 
the public. The costumes, setting, and Indian warrior all lend the 
image an air of authenticity, despite inaccuracies (see The Art 
Historian's Lens , page 795), and in an era before photography and 
film, made the audience feel as though it were indeed witnessing 
its great national hero at the very moment he sacrificed his life for 
his country.

The Elusive Meaning of West's The Death of General Wolfe 


T he history of art is filled with mysteries, and among the most com¬ 
mon unknowns for art made before 1 900 are the authorship and 
date of a piece, the reason it was made, and its message. Art histori¬ 
ans are often forced to rely on speculation, a tactic filled with risk but 
one that has the advantage of beginning an intellectual dialogue that 
may lead to firm answers. Benjamin West’s The Death of General Wolfe 
raises probing questions. The most obvious question is, why did West 
depict this particular subject? The key to the answer may be the figure 
of William Johnson, who is shown in a green coat to the left (see fig. 
23.6). His name and a map with “Mohawk Valley” and “Ontario” on it 
are etched on his powder horn. These territories had been ceded to 
him as superintendent of Indian affairs by the Native Americans. More 
important, he had been the hero at the battles of Lake George and Fort 


Niagara and therefore was a symbol of the important role that 
Americans played in winning the French and Indian War. Despite the 
picture’s historicism, West’s image is a fiction: Johnson had not been 
at Quebec, and the Indians aided the French, not the British. West made 
this picture on the threshold of the American Revolution (the Boston 
Massacre was in 1 770), and his ahistorical inclusion of Johnson was 
perhaps designed to make the British aware of their indebtedness to 
the colonists, represented here by Johnson, who as faithful citizens had 
supported Britain, and of the need to be more conciliatory in granting 
the concessions they felt they had earned. This interpretation accounts 
for many of the unusual components in the painting, although the fact 
that the explanation is so logical is its only proof. Although conjecture, 
it certainly provides a new way to think about the picture. 



\A 


\A 


The painting was also successful because West aggrandized 
and classicized his figures and the event, in effect creating a mod¬ 
ern Classical scene. Contemporary viewers recognized they were 
in the presence of what amounted to a traditional Lamentation 
scene (for instance, see fig. 14.15), and that their hero was a mod¬ 
ern-day Christ or martyr. The surrounding “apostles” express 
remorse and concern, but their powerful emotions, worthy of 
Poussin according to contemporary reviewers, are noble and con¬ 
trolled, in keeping with the Classical rule of decorum. Figures 
strike contrapposto poses, stand in Classical profile, and have the 
sculptural quality of a shallow ancient relief or Raphael saint, 
apostle, or Greek philosopher (see fig. 16.24); they are simultane¬ 
ously modern and Classical. The one unemotional figure is the 
Iroquois, Rousseaus “noble savage,” whom West presents with 
the grandeur and composure of an ancient river-god. West s paint¬ 
ing technique was influenced by that of Hamilton and Mengs, 
both of whom he knew in Rome, for he first drew and then 
colored in the figures, allowing crisp contours to ennoble them. 

Grand Manner Portraiture in 

the Neoclassical Style: Joshua Reynolds 

Portraiture dominated British painting, for it was extremely diffi¬ 
cult to earn a living as a history painter—there just was not much 
demand for it. Nonetheless, it was a fashionable “face painter,” as 
portraitists were derogatorily called, who played a major role in 
encouraging British artists to turn to working in a grand manner 
that aspired to match the great accomplishments of the ancients 
and their Classical heirs in the Renaissance and Baroque. This 
proselytizer was Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), who studied in 
Rome from 1750 to 1752 and returned to London determined to 
elevate British art in the mold of the great masters. Working 
behind the scenes, Reynolds played a role in establishing the 
Royal Academy of Art in 1768, and as a favorite of George III, he 
was appointed the body’s first president, a position he held until 
his death in 1792. From 1769 to 1790, Reynolds delivered his 


Fifteen Discourses on Art , in which he laid out theories similar to 
those of Charles Le Brun, the first director of the French Royal 
Academy (see page 745). He advocated history painting in the 
grand manner, emulation of the great masters, and an idealization 
in art. 

While Reynolds was financially forced to spurn history paint¬ 
ing for portraiture, he elevated the genre by encasing his figures in 
Classical poses and layering the images with recondite references 
of the kind that could be found in great history painting. Upon 
returning from Rome, for example, he painted a monumental 
full-length portrait of Commodore Keppel (1753), which shows 
the subject walking on a beach after a shipwreck. But Keppel is 
ennobled, for his pose is clearly based on the Apollo Belvedere (see 
page 157), then considered one of the great monuments of Greek 
art that Reynolds saw during his time in Rome. In his 1765 
portrait Lady Sarah Bunbury Sacrificing to the Graces (fig. 23.7), 
Reynolds fills his picture with Classicisms. The presentation of 
the Three Graces on an antique pedestal at the upper left of the 
picture is based on a well-known Hellenistic sculpture. Lady 
Sarahs gown is not contemporary dress but rather ancient drap¬ 
ery, pinned at the shoulder and with a band at the waist. The 
brazier, urn, and architecture are also antique. The sitter s pose is 
based on a figure in a Guido Reni painting (see page 672). 

Like a history painter, Reynolds has loaded his image with 
symbols. Using Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia or Andrea Alciatii’s 
Emblemata , books of symbols dating to the Renaissance that were 
vital resources for history painters, Reynolds selected the Three 
Graces because they were a representation of amicitia , or friend¬ 
ship. Ripa declared that the three figures symbolize the three 
stages of friendship, which are the giving, receiving, and constant 
exchange of friendship between friends. The intertwined arms 
represent this exchange, and the nudity the openness of 
friendship. The myrtle wreath held by the central figure signifies 
friendships self-propagation, while the roses on the pedestal 
represent its beauty and pleasure. The figure pouring a sacrificial 
libation has been identified as Lady Sarah s lifelong friend, Lady

Susan Fox-Strangways. While little is known about the commis¬ 
sion for this picture, scholars believe the painting is as much about 
the platonic dedication of the women to one another as it is a 
portrait of Lady Sarah. 

In the 1750s and 1760s, Reynolds made countless portraits 
that could be described as Neoclassical, pictures filled with 
Classical references and executed in a style that has a strong linear 
quality as well as smooth modeling and even lighting that sculp¬ 
turally forms figures and objects. But in his quest to emulate the 
Old Masters, as he advocated in his Discourses, Reynolds was a 
stylistic chameleon, at one moment taking his cue from Raphael, 
the next Guido Reni, the next Rubens, and the next Rembrandt. 
One artist who is lurking behind most of his pictures in some 
form, however, is Anthony van Dyck, the Flemish painter who 


ended his brief career painting royalty in London. His enormous 
full-lengths portraits with grandly yet elegantly posed figures (see 
fig. 20.8) challenged most portraitists in eighteenth-century 
Britain, and despite the Neoclassical look of Lady Sarah Bunbury, 
this almost 8-foot-high canvas, which would proudly preside in a 
public room of the sitter s imposing home, reflects the scale and 
grandeur of Van Dyck s work. 

Architecture and Interiors: 

The Palladian Revival 

In Britain, a Classical revival began much earlier in architecture 
than it did in painting and sculpture, and its origins date to the 
architectural treatises of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of 
Shaftesbury, and of Colen Campbell, published in the 1710s. Both 
writers argued for a British architecture based on antiquity and 
Antonio Palladios classically inspired villas, which not only 
evoked antiquity but projected a perfect harmony using geome¬ 
try, mathematics, and logic (see pages 614-17). Sounding much 
like Winckelmann did when he was discussing sculpture some 50 
years later, Shaftesbury, in his Letter Concerning Art , or Science of 
Design (1712), wrote that the proportions and geometry of 
ancient architecture reflected the nobility and beauty of the Greek 
and Roman soul, which have a powerful effect on the enlightened 
“man of taste. ” Architecture was beauty, not function. 

The works of both Campbell and Shaftesbury reflect a British 
antagonism toward Roman Catholicism. In Britain, Baroque 
architecture was associated with two evils: papist Rome and 
French royalty. Shaftesbury a patron and student of John Locke, 
was an advocate of individual freedom, and he equated ancient 
architecture with democracy He was also a member of the Whigs, 
the liberal antimonarchy political party (The Tories, the conser¬ 
vative promonarchy party, had backed the Roman Catholic Stuart 
king James II, who died in 1701.) In 1714, the Whig party came to 
power, ending 13 years of political turmoil. Its democratic mem¬ 
bers especially identified with Classical-revival architecture, for 
they saw themselves as the modern equivalent of Roman senators, 
who had country villas in addition to city houses. Campbell, who 
was virtually unknown prior to the publication of Vitruvius 
Britannicus (1715-25), could hardly fill singlehandedly the 
demand from Whigs who wanted Palladian-style country homes. 
His three-volume treatise consisted of dozens of his own 
Palladio-inspired designs, which formed a pattern book for archi¬ 
tects for the remainder of the century Most British architects had 
a copy of Campbell s Vitruvius Britannicus as well as Vitruvius 5 
Ten Books o f Architecture and Palladio s Four Books. 

THE COUNTRY VILLA! CHISWICK HOUSE We can see the 

impact of Vitruvius Britannicus on Campbells patron, Lord 
Burlington (1694-1753), who after a trip to Italy in 1719 became 
an amateur architect and eventually supplanted Campbell as the 
leading Palladian. In 1725, Burlington with the artist William 
Kent (1684-1748) designed Chiswick House (fig. 23.8), located 
on Burlington’s estate outside of London and one of the most

Palladios Villa Rotonda (see fig. 17.34), which Lord Burlington 
had studied on his Grand Tour. The exterior staircase, however, 
could just as well have come from Campbell s 1715 design for the 
facade of Wanstead House, which appears in volume one of 
Vitruvius Britannicus. 

Chiswick House is remarkable for its simplicity and logic, 
making it easy to understand why Lord Burlington was such a 
success as an architect. The building is a cube. Its walls are plain 
and smooth, allowing for a distinct reading of their geometric 
shape and the form of the windows. The Greek temple portico 
protrudes from the wall, again creating a simple and clear form. 
Even the prominent domed octagonal rotunda is geometric, as are 
its tripartite semicircular clerestory windows, based on windows 
in Roman baths. Here we have reason and logic clearly stated, and 
put in the service of the ideals of morality, nobility, and republi¬ 
can government. Like Shaftsbury, Burlington believed architec¬ 
ture to be an autonomous art dealing in morality and aesthetics, 
not function. 

URBAN PLANNING! BATH Perhaps the greatest example of 
the Classical revival in Britain is in Bath, a resort that had been a 
spa town since Roman times. Local architects John Wood the 
Elder (ca. 1704-1754) and the Younger (1728-1782) played a 
major role in developing the sleepy town as it expanded to accom¬ 
modate the flood of wealthy Londoners who as a result of the 
burgeoning economy at midcentury came to “take the waters. ” In 


the 1740s and 1750s, John Wood the Elder, influenced by the 
Classical revival, aspired to evoke ancient Rome and designed an 
imperial gymnasium, forum, and circus. Only the last was real¬ 
ized with success. Built in 1764, it consists of 33 attached houses 
surrounding a circle and divided by three streets. The facades are 
identical and continuous, and resemble the Colosseum turned 
outside in (see fig. 7.20). John Wood the Younger upstaged his 
father in 1767 when he designed the Royal Crescent (fig. 23.9), 
a crescent-shaped space containing 30 houses. Wood the Younger 
used a colossal Palladian Ionic order mounted on a podium base¬ 
ment, giving the facade a magnificent unified grandeur. The 
Woods’ urban planning of circuses was so innovative it would be 
replicated in Britain right through the nineteenth century. 

THE NEOCLASSICAL INTERIOR The British taste for 
the Classical extended to interior design and was largely created 
by one man, Robert Adam (1728-1792). Adam was a wealthy 
Scottish architect who made the Grand Tour from 1754 to 1758. 
He scrambled over the Roman ruins, assisting Piranesi in measur¬ 
ing and documenting the deteriorating structures and recon¬ 
structing them on paper. Upon returning to Great Britain, he 
began practicing in London and was soon the city’s most fashion¬ 
able architect. Although he designed several houses, his specialty 
was renovating interiors and designing additions, especially for 
country homes. Along with Joshua Reynolds, Adam played a 
major role in developing a taste for the Neoclassical in London in 
the late 1750s.

23.9 John Wood the Younger. Royal Crescent, Bath, England. 1767-ca. 1775 


A fine example of his work is the library wing at Kenwood 
(fig. 23.10), built in 1767-69. The ceiling of the room is a Roman 
barrel vault, and at either end is an apse separated from the main 
room by Corinthian columns. This concept comes largely from 
Palladio. The decoration is based on Classical motifs, which 
Adam could copy from the many archaeological books then being 
published. On the one hand, the library is quite Classical, not just 
because of the motifs, but also because it is symmetrical, geomet¬ 
ric, and carefully balanced. On the other hand, it is filled with 
movement, largely because of the wealth of details and shapes that 
force the eye to jump from one design element to the next. 
Adam s palette is pastel in color and light in tone; light blues, 
white, and gold prevail. Curving circles, delicate plant forms, and 
graceful fluted columns with ornate capitals set a festive, elegant, 
and refined tone closer to Rococo playfulness than to 
Neoclassical morality. For the decorative wall paintings, Adam 
often turned to the Italian Antonio Zucchi and occasionally to 
Angelica Kauffmann, whom Zucchi married in 1781. 


EARLY ROMANTICISM IN BRITAIN 

The architect Sir John Vanbrugh was not only one of the leading 
figures of the British Baroque (see page 758), he was also respon¬ 
sible for introducing Gothic design to domestic architecture when 
he built his own London mansion, Claremont, in 1708, silhouet¬ 
ting the roofline with massive medieval crenelations. This deci¬ 
sion to depart from the Baroque or Classical may at first seem 
incongruous, but within Vanbrugh are the seeds of Romantic 
longing for emotional experience. Vanbrugh argued not to 
destroy old buildings but rather to conserve them because they 
inspire “more lively and pleasing Reflections on the Persons who 
have inhabited them; on the remarkable things which have been 
transacted in them, or the extraordinary occasions of erecting 
them.” This longing for exotic experience, of being transported 
mentally to a distant past, gradually became a prevailing senti¬ 
ment in British art, surfacing in painting, architecture, and land¬ 
scape design. By the closing decades of the eighteenth century 


798 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 











































23.10 Robert Adam. Library, Kenwood, London. 1767-69 


exotic experience alone would not be sufficient; audiences would 
want to be awed or terrified, just as they do today when they go 
to see a horror film. 


Architecture and Landscape Design: 

The Sublime and the Picturesque 

We do not know precisely what motivated Edmund Burke to 
write his 1756 treatise A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of 
Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautijul (see page 790), but he must 
in part have been prompted by the period s increasing desire to 
undergo powerful subjective experiences, an emphasis that existed 
alongside a strong belief in the primacy of logic and empiricism. 
We have already seen how Piranesi created a sense of awe and 
melancholy in his etchings of Roman monuments, which were 
popular throughout Europe and were often labeled “sublime” 
once the word became current. The British, however, were prin¬ 
cipally responsible for developing a taste for the sublime in the 
visual arts—for the experience of undergoing the most primal 
of emotions, those verging on terror—and it first appears in 
architecture and garden design. 

Simultaneously, the British also developed two other concepts 
or principles, neither of which is a style. One is the picturesque. 


Initially the term was used in the guidebooks to the Lake District 
in the north of England to mean a scenic view that resembled a 
landscape painting. It gradually came to mean as well that some¬ 
thing had variety and delightful irregularities that made it inter¬ 
esting to look at, and the concept was offered as an alternative to, 
on the one hand, the sublime, which caused awe and fear, or as 
Burke claimed, a feeling of a need for self-preservation, and, on 
the other hand, beauty which was manifest in smooth, symmetri¬ 
cal, and harmonious qualities that generated feelings of joy pleas¬ 
ure, and love. The British writer William Gilpin, who played a 
major role in defining the term picturesque in several late 
eighteenth-century treatises, wrote that a Gothic castle would be 
infinitely more interesting and picturesque if it were in a state of 
decay a crumbling ruin covered with vegetation. In a painting, 
this ruin would offer greater variety for the eye if it were executed 
with a large range of colors instead of just a few, and were lit with 
a strong light that resulted in a play of dark and light as opposed 
to even, uniform illumination. Although not discussed by Gilpin, 
this same Gothic castle could be considered beautiful if exquis¬ 
itely proportioned and in perfect condition, and it would be 
sublime if it were enormous, dark, and foreboding, seeming to 
harbor unseen dangers. The picturesque, in contrast to the 
sublime, generated visual interest, not fright or awe. 

The other major concept developed at the time was associa- 
tionism, a term invented by twentieth-century historians to 
describe the eighteenth centurys love of layering architecture and 
garden design with numerous associations, many exotic, that were 
often designed to elicit emotional responses as well as to edify 
Enlightenment research and publications vastly increased the 
knowledge of history and the world, and this knowledge was now 
poured into art. Winckelmann and Piranesi, for example, gave 
separate identities to Greek and Roman art, which had previously 
been combined under the banner of Classical art; now artists 
could make reference to the “noble simplicity and calm grandeur” 
of the Greeks or to the imperial might of the Romans. We have 
already seen, for example, how British architects evoked republi¬ 
can Rome in their buildings in order to elicit a sense of democ¬ 
racy While architecture had always been representational, that is, 
containing associations, now these associations became more 
extensive, precise, formal, and literary. 

THE ENGLISH LANDSCAPE GARDEN Burlington and Kent 
landscaped the grounds surrounding the Palladian-revival 
Chiswick House to look natural, that is, unplanned and without 
human intervention. This was a radical departure from the style of 
the house itself and from the geometric gardens that were then in 
vogue, such as those at Versailles (see fig. 21.12). Winding paths, 
rolling lawn-covered hills, serpentine ponds, and irregular stands 
of trees greeted visitors making their way to the mansion. 
Picturesque asymmetry rather than orderly geometric symmetry 
prevailed. However, these natural-looking grounds were not 
intended to be a re-creation of untamed nature; rather, they were 
an idealized vision of the Classical past as if rendered in a land¬ 
scape painting by Claude Lorrain (see fig. 21.8), who was

23.11 Henry Flitcroft and Henry Hoare II. Park at Stourhead, Wiltshire, England. Designed 1743, executed 1744-65, with later additions 


extremely popular among British collectors. Aristocrats arriving 
in their carriages even had special yellow-tinted “Claude” glasses 
that gave the view the same warm twilight glow found in the 
French masters paintings. On the one hand, we can label the 
grounds as Neoclassical, since they are meant to evoke the 
Classical past as seen through the eyes of Claude. But on the other 
hand, they are Romantic, for they are designed to transport view¬ 
ers psychologically into a lost Arcadian world, an immersion 
accompanied by powerful emotions. 

Kent was probably responsible for most of the landscaping at 
Chiswick, and he became renowned as a landscape designer, 
rather than as an architect. He is credited with establishing the 
English style of landscape garden, his finest perhaps being the one 
he developed at Stowe in the 1740s. There, Kent sprinkled the 
grounds with carefully sited Classical temples and Gothic 
“ruins.” Unfortunately, there is very little left of Kents gardens. 
The best-preserved picturesque landscape garden is by two fol¬ 
lowers of Kent and Burlington, the architect Henry Flitcroft 
(1697-1769) and the banker Henry Hoare II (1705-1785), who 
started developing the grounds on the latter s estate at Stourhead 
in Wiltshire in 1743 (fig. 23.11). In the carefully orchestrated view 
reproduced here, we look across a charming bridge and artificial 
lake to see nestled in the distant trees a Pantheon-like structure 
that is a replica of the Temple of Apollo in Claude s Coast View of 
Delos with Aeneas , a picture based on Vergil s epic poem The 
Aeneid. The path around the lake is meant to be an allegorical 
reference to the journey of Aeneas through the underworld, for 
the lake itself represents Lake Avernus, the entrance to the under¬ 
world. A grotto by the lake contains statues of a nymph and river- 
god. Thus, not only are there picturesque variety and views in the 
park at Stourhead, but there are also layers of historical and 
literary associations. Nor is the park limited to Greek and Roman 
motifs, for it includes rustic cottages, a Gothic spire, a Turkish 
tent, and Chinese bridges, an encyclopedic compendium reflect¬ 
ing Enlightenment discoveries. And there are also the sham ruins 


that Kent popularized at Stowe “to raise the imagination to sub¬ 
lime enthusiasm, and to soften the heart to poetic melancholy,” as 
contemporaries themselves described them. 

In other words, the English garden did more than just evoke 
the nobility of the Classical past, in which case it would simply be 
described as Neoclassical. It also catered to a Romantic sensibility 
developing at the time—a sensibility characterized by delight in 
the exotic as well as a desire to experience powerful emotions. It 
was, in fact, a Piranesian contemplation of the destructive power 
of time and mortality as seen in the ruins. Burke had put the word 
sublime into play and, as we saw in the previous quote about 
sham ruins, the period was using it. 

THE GOTHIC REVIVAL! STRAWBERRY HILL While the 
Woods were developing Bath to look like a Roman city and 
Palladian country houses were springing up all over Britain, a 
Gothic revival was also taking place. An interest in Gothic archi¬ 
tecture—which was then perceived as a national architecture 
because it was believed to have originated in Britain—was 
sparked in part by the appearance of some of the first literature on 
the style, which until then had been so little studied that no one 
knew when the buildings were made or that they even belonged 
to different periods of the Gothic, each with a different style. 
After midcentury, books began to identify the major buildings 
and their dates, and to define a development of Gothic architec¬ 
ture. But the Gothic style s appeal in large part lay in its sublime 
qualities. The cathedrals were cold, dark, and gloomy and con¬ 
tained vast overwhelming spaces. Gothic ruins, which could be 
seen everywhere, evoked associations of death, melancholy and 
even horror. In 1764, the Gothic novel emerged as a genre with 
the publication of Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto: A 
Gothic Story , which was set in a haunted castle. The book started 
a medieval craze that peaked with Victor Hugos 1831 Notre- 
Dame de Paris , in which the dark, foreboding cathedral is the 
home of the terrifying hunchbacked recluse Quasimodo.

23.12 Horace Walpole, with William Robinson and others. Strawberry 
Hill, Twickenham, England. 1749-77 

Horace Walpole (1717-1797) also deserves credit for making 
the Gothic revival fashionable when, with a group of friends, he 
redesigned Strawberry Hill (fig. 23.12), his country house in 
Twickenham, just outside of London. Started in 1749, the renova¬ 
tion took over 25 years to complete. The house is distinctly 
medieval; the walls are capped with crenelated battlements and 
pierced by tracery windows. While Walpole may have thought 
of these features as eliciting a sublime quality, they are not 
really sublime. Instead they have a Rococo delicateness. The 
crenelations are petite, not massive, and the windows sit near the 
surface, making the walls look delicate, not fortresslike. Instead, 
Walpole s concept of the Gothic revival is more limited to just 



being picturesque; the L-shaped building is irregular, asymmetri¬ 
cal, and looks like an accretion of additions from different 
periods, which it actually is because the building was erected 
piecemeal over a long period, with each section being designed by 
a different person. (The Neoclassical architect Robert Adam, for 
example, contributed the turret.) A Rococo lightness also charac¬ 
terizes the interior, as in the Picture Gallery (fig. 23.13). Walpole 
insisted on historical accuracy for his rooms and had architectural 
details copied from engravings of medieval buildings that were 
being researched at that time. The gallery ceiling, for example, is 
taken from the Lady Chapel of Henry VII at Westminster Abbey 
(see fig. 12.54). The walls may be richly brocaded, but they look 
dainty, as though covered with lace-paper doilies, while the thin, 
gilded fan vault is elegant and lighthearted. Walpole verbally 
expressed the playfulness with which he approached the past 
when he wrote about “the charming venerable Gothic” and 
“whimsical air of novelty” the style lent contemporary buildings. 
Walpole s Gothic revival was in many respects as playful and dec¬ 
orative as Adam s Classical revival, a reminder that both represent 
a transition from the Rococo to the true Romantic revival, which 
would be much more somber, awe-inspiring, and even horrific, as 
seen in Fonthill Abbey of 1796 (see fig. 24.28). 

Early Romantic Painting in Britain 

Just as the Gothic revival thrived alongside the Classical revival in 
Britain, Romantic painting coexisted with Neoclassical. Romantic 
undercurrents even appeared in pictures that are essentially 
Classical, a paradox that underscores the limitations of labeling. 
Like a moth to a flame, the taste of the period was increasingly 
drawn to the awesome power of nature, the experience of unfet¬ 
tered elemental emotions and instincts, and even the wonder of 
the irrational. In effect, the Enlightenment at moments could 
deny its very foundation of logic and empiricism and permit itself 
to be swept away by the emotional pull of the exotic, wondrous, 
terrifying, and unexplainable. But we must remember that this 
thirst for sublime experiences stems from an identifiably 
Enlightenment mentality. Burkes treatise on the sublime, for 
example, reflects the Enlightenment inquiry into the operation 
of the human mind, while the cataloguing of the emotions and 
experiences parallels the compendious nature of Diderot and 
d’Alembert s Encyclopedia. 

GEORGE STUBBS While we can only speculate as to whether 
Piranesi in his prints of Roman monuments was at all influenced 
by Burke’s concept of the sublime, we know for sure that the 
treatise spurred George Stubbs (1724-1806) in the early 1760s to 
paint his series of approximately 21 paintings of a lion attacking 
either a horse or a stag, works that represent some of first exam¬ 
ples of Romantic painting. Stubbs, who was from Liverpool, was 
a largely self-taught artist. He started as portrait painter in the 
north of England in the 1740s, and from 1745 to 1751 studied and 
taught human anatomy at York County Hospital. In 1754, he 
went to Italy, only to declare that he could learn nothing from the 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 801 














Greeks and Romans; nature instead would be his only source 
of inspiration. Upon returning to England, he moved to 
Lincolnshire, where he practiced this professed Enlightenment 
empiricism by dissecting horses in order to study their anatomy. 
In 1766, he published his studies in Anatomy o fa Horse. This was 
after he had moved to London, where he almost instantly became 
the country’s foremost painter of horses, portraits that often also 
included an owner or groom holding the horses lead. Never 
before had horses been painted with such scientific precision, a 
quality that in part accounted for Stubbs’s acclaim. 

While returning via ship from Rome in 1755, Stubbs saw a lion 
attack a horse in Morocco. When he repeatedly painted the scene, 
he was clearly under the influence of Burke’s treatise, as seen in a 
fine 1770 example (fig. 23.14). Here, Stubbs quite deliberately set 
out to create a horrifying natural event that would evoke a sub¬ 
lime emotion in a viewer. Stubbs’s protagonists are animals, who, 
unlike humans, are immersed in nature and at one with it, virtual 
personifications of unleashed natural forces. We identify with the 
horse, which is white, a symbol of goodness and purity. Its 
mouth, eye, mane, and legs are taut with fear and pain. Evil is 
represented by the lion’s dark powerful legs, which seem almost 
nonchalant as they rip into the horse’s back, pulling the skin 
away to expose a skeletal ribcage. The lion’s body disappears into 
the blackness of the landscape, identifying its evil force with a 


frightening darkness and elemental powers that surge from the 
earth. Ominous storm clouds announce the horse’s fate as they 
threaten to cast the entire scene into dark shadow at the moment, 
we assume, the doomed horse expires. West, in The Death of 
General Wolje, similarly harnessed the forces of nature to rein¬ 
force the emotional intensity and psychology of his figures. 

JOSEPH WRIGHT Joseph Wright (1734-1797), born and raised 
in Derby in the Midlands, went to London in 1751 to study paint¬ 
ing with a well-known portraitist, Thomas Hudson, with whom 
he later worked. However, Wright then returned to the Derby 
area, where he essentially spent his entire life. From here, he sent 
pictures to London, first to the Society of Artists and, after 1778, 
to the Royal Academy. While Wright earned his living largely 
from portraiture, he is best known today for his genre paintings 
and landscapes and has been hailed as “the first professional 
painter to express the spirit of the Industrial Revolution,” of 
which he was in the middle since Derby is near Birmingham, the 
center of the Industrial Revolution. This acclaim is largely due to 
his paintings of iron forges and factories. He also made pictures of 
science experiments, and was himself a member of the Lunar 
Society, a Birmingham scientific organization that included many 
major figures, such as the physiologist and natural philosopher 
Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Many of

Wright s images were set at night so that he could indulge in his 
scientific love of painting complicated light effects, which some¬ 
times emanated from an artificial light source, including newly 
invented gas lamps. 

In many of his images, Wright sought to create a sense of the 
miraculous or the unusual, thus reflecting the Romantic curiosity 
for new experiences and powerful emotions. A fine example of 
this is The Old Man and Death (fig. 23.15), painted toward 1773. 
The theme comes from Aesops fables (also recounted by Jean de 
La Fontaine), in which an old man, exhausted from carrying his 
load of faggots, falls to the ground and summons Death to come 
and take him away so that he need not return to his labor. Death 
instantly appears, terrifying the wearied worker, who now insists 
that he is fine, picks up his bundle, and continues about his busi¬ 
ness. In his painting Wright shows us Death, in the form of a 
skeleton with an arrow resting in his right palm, approaching the 
fatigued elder, who suddenly develops the energy of a horse. 
Although a daylight scene, Wright blasts the startled faggot- 
gatherer with an eerie powerful light, which seems to make him 
reel backwards. Adding to the sense of doom and gloom is the 
Gothic ruin, covered in plants, as were Piranesi s Roman ruins. 
Moss dangles from surrounding trees, contributing further to the 
lugubrious atmosphere. Employing his scientific approach to 
image making, Wright shuns Rococo paint handling and color, 
and instead carefully picks out each and every detail in the 
scene—every pebble on the ground, brick on the Gothic ruin, and 
leaf on the plants and trees. After finishing this frightening 
picture, Wright left for Italy, where instead of studying Greek and 
Roman art, he headed off to Naples. There, he watched the 


awesome eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which he painted, as well 
as sublime cavernous caves that he explored on the Bay of Naples. 

JOHN HENRY FUSELI Early Romanticism in Britain culmi¬ 
nated in the art of the Swiss-born painter John Henry Fuseli 
(1741-1825), whose special province was plumbing the innermost 
recesses of the mind and the incomprehensible forces within 
nature. Fuseli initially intended to be a theologian. In Zurich, he 
studied with the famous philosopher Johann Jakob Bodmer 
(1698-1783), who introduced him to the works of Shakespeare, 
Dante, Homer, and Milton, and to the Nibelungenlied , a medieval 
Norse epic that Germans believed was the northern equivalent of 
Homers The Odyssey and The Iliad. He also befriended Johann 
Kaspar Lavater, a poet and physiognomist, who was an antagonist 
of rationalism despite his scientific interest in the way facial fea¬ 
tures reflected states of mind and personality. Lavater s interest in 
psychology heavily influenced Fuseli. As important, Lavater put 
Fuseli in direct contact with the German Sturm und Drang, , which 
clearly influenced his development as an artist. He was especially 
captivated by the concept of the antihero, found, for example, in 
Goethe s The Sorrows ofYoung Werther (1774). The novel tells the 
tale of a young man, Werther, who rejects society falls in love 
with a woman who spurns him, and in depression kills himself, 
suicide, in effect, being an extreme form of withdrawal from 
civilization and return to nature. The antihero was an important 
new kind of hero, one who established personal moral codes and 
followed personal passions to attain freedom and fulfill individual 
needs. These values would become part of the foundation of 
Fuseli s art. 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 803 





In 1764, Fuseli moved to London. Encouraged by Reynolds, 
he took up painting and in 1770 went to Rome, where he became 
the leading figure in a circle of British and Swedish artists that 
included Thomas Banks. Dismissing Winckelmann s adulation of 
the calm grandeur and noble simplicity of Greek sculpture, as 
well as the perfect harmony of the High Renaissance as repre¬ 
sented by Raphael, he gravitated to Michelangelo s colossal, twist¬ 
ing, muscular figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling and especially 
the Last Judgment (see fig. 17.14). He was also inspired by the 
distorted anatomies of such Mannerists as Parmigianino (see fig. 
17.29) and Rosso Fiorentino (see fig. 17.1). 

Fuseli s selection of subjects was as unique as his style. Instead 
of noble, virtuous scenes drawn from the Roman historians Livy 
and Plutarch, he chose psychologically and physically agonizing 
events from Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and Ossian (a 
fake ancient Gaelic epic poet invented by James Macpherson and 
foisted on the public in the 1760s), many with erotic overtones. 
The more horrific and tortured the scene, the better, and the 
artists surrounding Fuseli in Rome favored similar themes. By the 
1780s, Fuselis subject matter dominated British painting, with

even the Neoclassicist Benjamin West painting lurid scenes from 
Shakespeare and the Bible. 

Upon Fuselis return to London in 1779, his themes and style 
were fixed, as we can see in Thor Battering the Midgard Serpent 
(fig. 23.16) of 1790. The subject comes from the Nibelungenlied , 
an epic tale of the doom that results in the demise of the gods and 
the end of the cosmos and all morality. The wolf Skoll devours the 
sun and his brother Hatii eats the moon, plunging the world into 
darkness. Earthquakes shatter the world, releasing such monsters 
as Jormugand, the Midgard Serpent, who arises from the sea 
intent on poisoning the land and sky. Gods and giants fight fierce 
battles with the monsters, and here Thor, the god of thunder, is 
charged with slaying Jormugand, although ultimately he dies 
from the serpents poison. The scene radiates sublime horror, 
from which the boatman shrinks and the ghost-white Wotan, king 
of the gods, cowers. Neoclassical planarity, tight drawing, consis¬ 
tent lighting, and the smooth handling of paint are replaced by an 
explosion of light, a flurry of Baroque brushwork, and a dramatic 
composition. The bold elements of this composition include the 
tensely coiled serpent, the deep recession of both the boat and 
boatman, and the violent upward thrust of Thor, whose 
Michelangeloesque proportions seen from the low vantage point 
of the serpent itself endow him with an appearance of Herculean 
strength. The image is all blood, water, rippling flesh, the heat of 
the serpent s breath, and the darkness of night, and because of the 
serpent s-eye perspective, a viewer is immersed in nature and put 
directly in the midst of the violent, frightening struggle. 

While Thor epitomizes courage and sacrifice, Fuseli was often 
interested in portraying unconventional heroes who follow per¬ 
sonal passion and exemplify individual freedom, especially in the 
face of societal pressure to conform and repress desires. How else 
to explain Fuseli s admiration for the Satan of Milton s epic poem 
Paradise Lost , whom he painted numerous times within the circle 
of Chaos, calling up his legions to launch a futile attack on the 
unfallen world of the Garden of Eden? Fuseli himself exemplified 
artistic freedom in his unique style and unconventional subjects, 
as well as in highly personal images, such as The Nightmare (fig. 
23.17) of 1781. The meaning of this work remains a puzzle. 
Clearly, sex permeates the picture, from the figure s erotic pose, to 
the mare s penetration of the “vaginal” parting of the curtain, and 
the sensual red of the fabric. But does the incubus (an evil spirit 
that has sexual intercourse with women while they sleep) on the 
womans stomach represent her own psychotic monster or 
Fuseli s own repressed desires? A portrait of a woman on the back 
of the canvas suggests the exposed libido is Fuseli s, for although 
the figure is not identified, it may be of a Zurich woman who 
spurned the artists offer of marriage in 1779 when he was passing 
through the city en route to London. 

Regardless of the answer, this very personal painting is an 
extraordinary image, powerful, unique, and filled with sublime 
terror. It explores the erotic depths of the human mind and shrugs 
off expectations of what painting is supposed to be about. With 
Fuseli we have moved into the full-blown Romantic era, which 
begins to emerge throughout Europe toward 1800.

Romanticism in Grand Manner 
Portraiture: Thomas Gainsborough 

Just as we saw that Neoclassicism affected portraiture in the work 
of Sir Joshua Reynolds, so too did burgeoning Romanticism. It is 
best exemplified in the portraits of Reynoldss nemesis, Thomas 
Gainsborough (1727-1788). Gainsborough was born into a pros¬ 
perous Sudbury manufacturing family, and after studying paint¬ 
ing in London with a French Rococo painter in the 1740s, he 
returned to his native Suffolk, initially painting landscapes. But to 
earn a living, he soon turned to portraiture, and in 1759 moved 
to Bath to take advantage of the wealthy clientele who came there 
to vacation. He did not move to London until 1774, but the 
appearance of his works at the Society of Artists from 1761 and 
the Royal Academy after 1769 established him as one of the lead¬ 
ing artists of his day. 

Like Reynolds, Gainsborough took his cue from Van Dyck, 
and his forte was enormous, life-size, full-length portraits, the fig¬ 
ures often having elegant proportions and poses. While Reynolds 
created bold, modeled forms, Gainsborough dissolved figures and 
objects in lush, feathery brushwork, as can be seen in his 1785 
Portrait of Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan (fig. 23.18), the sitter 
being a celebrated soprano married to the playwright responsible 
for the comedy of manners The School for Scandal. Not only does

Gainsborough s gossamer-thin touch give an elegance to the sur¬ 
face, it also animates it, making it seethe with motion and tying all 
of the objects together. More important, Gainsborough has inte¬ 
grated Mrs. Sheridan into the landscape. Her hair is windswept, 
following the pattern of the tree above and behind her, which 
forms a halo of sky around her head. Her body also echoes the 
thrust of the land, her drapery rippling in the same direction as the 
leaves, clouds, and rock. Mrs. Sheridan is steeped in nature, virtu¬ 
ally swept away by it. Here we see demonstrated Rousseau s return 
to nature, the locus of innocence, beauty, and moral perfection. 

NEOCLASSICISM IN FRANCE 

As in Britain, the reaction against the Rococo in France first 
appeared in architecture, but it surfaced in the 1750s and 1760s, 
rather than the 1710s and 1720s. At first elegant and rational and 
largely based on seventeenth-century French Classical architec¬ 
ture, it moved into an austere, awe-inspiring, and even visionary 
stage by the late 1770s. This sublime phase of Neoclassicism had 
a profound impact on painting. Despite repeated appeals from 
numerous sources, including Enlightenment exponents and the 
government, painters were slow to meet the challenge to create a 
new moralistic art based on antiquity. It was not until the late 
1770s that large numbers of painters took up the cause, and it was 
not until the 1780s, with the advent of Jacques-Louis David and 
his austere brand of Neoclassicism, that a new style emerged, one 
that thrived well into the nineteenth century. 

Architecture: Rational Classicism 

The first phase of French Neoclassical architecture was a reaction 
to the excesses of the Rococo, which had been about asymmetry, 
graceful movement, decorative flourishes, and curvilinear ele¬ 
gance. The new architecture was about rational design, and hence 
is often called “Rational Classicism.” All components of a build¬ 
ing had to be geometric, symmetrical, and logical in the sense that 
they should be essential to the structure. While this rational phase 
of Neoclassical architecture was theoretically based on nature, it 
nonetheless took its lead from seventeenth-century French 
Classical architecture. 

THEORETICAL BEGINNINGS Launching the attack on the 
Rococo was the architect Jacques-Frangois Blondel (1705-1774), 
who in a speech at the opening of the Royal School of 
Architecture in 1747 condemned the ornate flamboyance of that 
style. Here, and in his later publications, he called for a return to 
the Classicism of great seventeenth-century architects: Claude 
Perrault, Nicolas-Frangois Mansart, and Louis Le Vau (see pages 
748-51). Applying Enlightenment reason, Blondel demanded that 
buildings be logical, simple, functional, and symmetrical. They 
should be constructed with right angles, not curves, and there 
should be no superfluous ornament. Facades were to reflect inte¬ 
rior layout and social use. 


Blondel s rationalism was seconded by the influential writer 
Abbe Marc-Antoine Laugier (1713-1769), who in his Essay on 
Architecture (1753) and Observations on Architecture (1765) 
declared that function, not beauty, should determine the style of a 
building. Denouncing decorative ornament as well, his theory 
permitted only columns, architraves, pediments, and walls, all of 
which were essential and therefore natural. He condemned 
pilasters, niches, and any nonfunctional wall decoration or shape. 
Architectural components had to be based on nature, as illus¬ 
trated by the famous engraving on the frontispiece of his Essay, a 
primitive hut, in essence the first building, consisting of four 
crude tree trunks dug into the ground in a rectangular configura¬ 
tion, with a gable roof made of twigs. This structure was the pri¬ 
mordial forerunner of the Greek post-and-lintel system and the 
pedimented facade. Laugier s aesthetics also accommodated 
Gothic architecture, for he viewed its soaring stone columns as 
logical and natural, like a forest of trees, and he loved its spacious¬ 
ness and light. Buttressing was structural, thus allowed. 

But the theoretician who stripped rational architecture down 
to a barebones austerity that pointed to the future was Jean- 
Frangois de Neufforge (1714-1791). Drawing on antiquity and 
Palladio but mostly on the British Palladians, his multivolume 
treatise Basic Collection of Architecture (1757-68) was filled with 
his own designs that reduced architecture to simple geometric 
forms: cubic houses, bare walls, severe unframed rectangular win¬ 
dows. Although he was otherwise virtually unknown, his treatise 
became a major source book for the period, one that many French 
architects owned and from which they lifted ideas. 

A second major force for the Classical revival in architecture 
was the marquis de Marigny, who in 1751 became director general 
of buildings, a position that gave him artistic control over France, 
since he oversaw all royal commissions for art and buildings, as 
well as the French Academy. In preparation for the appointment, 
he went on the Grand Tour with the architect Jacques-Germain 
Soufflot from 1749 to 1751, receiving a Classical education that 
would prepare him to revolutionize French taste. Upon return¬ 
ing, he hired Soufflot to finish Perrault s Louvre (see fig. 21.11), 
which at the time was literally a ruin and slated for demolition. 
After the completion of the Louvre, he instructed Ange-Jacques 
Gabriel (1698-1782), the newly appointed first architect to Louis 
XV, to erect two enormous government buildings on the north 
side of what is today the Place de la Concorde, where they can 
still be seen: two huge identical facades framing the Rue Royale. 
Gabriel had never been to Rome, and for him Classicism largely 
meant seventeenth-century French Classicism. His two buildings 
are so similar to Perrault s Louvre they almost do not need illus¬ 
trating: The major differences are that the double columns of 
Perrault s facade are now single, and the center pediment is 
removed, reappearing again at either end of the colonnade to 
become “bookends” framing the colonnade. 

JACQUES-GERMAIN SOUFFLOT It was Soufflot (1713-1780), 
an ardent follower of Blondel, who designed the most famous 
rationalist building. Unfortunately, his masterpiece, the church of 


806 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD

(formerly Sainte-Genevieve), Paris. 1757. 


Sainte-Genevieve, has been so altered, including its name and 
function, that its current appearance can be quite misleading. In 
1755, Marigny commissioned Soufflot to design the church. 
Within two years, the architect had completed his initial plan, 
which had a clearly stated geometry: an equilateral Greek cross 
with a six-column portico entrance (fig. 23.19). The wide square 


center crossing would have a hemispherical dome (modeled on 
the Pantheon in Rome) sitting on a drum supported by narrow 
piers consisting of four triangles, each triangle formed by three 
columns. Perrault s Louvre was his model. The pedimented sec¬ 
tion of the Louvres east faqade inspired the portico, and the 
Louvre colonnade provided the idea for the rows of interior 
Corinthian columns supporting an entablature. The drum for the 
dome largely derives from the circular peristyle Perrault used for 
the dome at the Louvre chapel. But Soufflot, following Laugier s 
vision of combining the clarity and grandeur of the Classical with 
the lightness and spaciousness of the Gothic, filled his church 
with light. Using a daring system of hidden buttresses, he was able 
to remove the wall mass and open the building up with enormous 
vertical windows. 

Unfortunately, the clergy and public attacked Soufflots 1757 
plan, and the church was heavily compromised. An apse was 
added and the transept extended, destroying the symmetry of the 
first design. To adjust to these new proportions, Soufflot had to 
increase the size of the dome, with the result that it looks more 
like the Baroque dome on Christopher Wrens St. Pauls 
Cathedral (see fig. 21.22). But the greatest abuses came with the 
French Revolution. In its ardor to erase religion and honor 
French heroes, the Directoire government of the new republic in 
1793 declared the building a pantheon to the nations leaders (fig. 
23.20). To convert the church into a lugubrious mausoleum, the 
windows were walled in and the interior ornamentation removed. 
Additional changes well into the nineteenth century further 
destroyed Soufflot s vision.

The Sublime in Neoclassical Architecture: 

The Austere and the Visionary 

French architecture started to move into a new, more austere 
phase in the 1770s, one less interested in following the rules of the 
ancients and more preoccupied with reducing architecture to ele¬ 
mental geometric forms that operate on a monumental scale and 
create a Piranesian sense of awe and power. Among the architects 
largely responsible for this aesthetic were Claude-Nicolas Ledoux 
and Etienne-Louis Boullee. 

M ARIE-JOSEPH PEYRE Marie-Joseph Peyre (1730-1785) was 
a student of Blondels, and in 1751 he won the Rome Prize. Fie 
met Piranesi and with his new mentor surveyed the baths of 
Caracalla and Diocletian (see figs. 7.58 and 7.63). This determined 
the course of his career, for he turned his back on the rules and 
propriety of Vitruvius and Palladio, and instead dreamed of mak¬ 
ing monumental, sublime architecture. In 1765, Peyre published 
Architectural Works , which included his plans for ideal buildings 
and the philosophy behind them. He emphasized the importance 
of scale and enormous cavernous spaces, especially advocating the 
use of vaults and domes that reflected the engineering prowess of 
the Romans. Modern architecture had to aspire to the sublime, to 
be awesome and grand—and he used the word “sublime” as 
defined by Burke. Decoration and detail were to be curtailed as 
the architect instead relied on the monumentality of the Romans 
to generate powerful emotional responses—shock, fear, awe, 
reverence, and passion. 

Peyre s Theatre Frangais (the present-day Theatre de POdeon, 
fig. 23.21), designed from 1767 to 1770 with another likeminded 
architect, Charles de Wailly, reflects the severity and monumen- 
tality that he advocated in his treatise, although it falls a bit short 
of a sense of the sublime, largely due to the practical restrictions 


of the commission. Nonetheless, the building seems austere com¬ 
pared to any eighteenth-century French building that preceded it. 
The facade consists of a towering two-story, unpedimented por¬ 
tico. Instead of elegant Corinthian or Ionic columns, Peyre used 
the harsh, unfluted Tuscan Doric. The only “decoration” is the 
striations and rustication of the stone. There are no frames around 
the arched doors and windows, and these openings penetrate deep 
within the wall, making it seem formidable and weighty 
Geometry prevails in the form of circles and rectangles, and in the 
strong horizontals of the entablatures. Peyre s theater is a forceful 
block of a building, imposing in scale, awesome in its massiveness, 
and rational in its geometry 

CLAUDE-NICOLAS LEDOUX Even more severe than Peyre s 
Theatre Frangais were the buildings of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux 
(1736-1806), also a student of Blondel. Ledoux was heavily influ¬ 
enced by Peyre s Architectural Works, Piranesis publications, and 
Neufforges Basic Collection of Architecture. He had no need of 
going to Italy By the mid-1760s he was a fashionable Parisian 
architect designing many of the most prestigious hotels partic¬ 
ulars , as grand private homes were called, and by the 1770s, he 
was designing austere Palladian residences. In 1771, Ledoux 
became inspector of the royal salt mine at Chaux in the Franche- 
Comte region of southeastern France, designing many of its 
buildings from 1774 to 1779. The entrance portico to the gate¬ 
house of the salt mine (fig. 23.22) was in the Tuscan Doric style, 
which meant columns had neither flutes nor base and instead 
brutally sprang directly from a platform. The wall behind these 
primitive columns had an enormous primordial arch made of raw, 
uncut stone. 

At Chaux, Ledoux developed a utopian vision of architecture, 
one that provided for the needs of employees of every rank. He 
was heavily influenced by Rousseau s vision of a world without

social barriers as well as by the social philosophy of an 
Enlightenment economic group called the Physiocrats, who 
advocated a basically agrarian economy that operated not only to 
benefit the proprietor class of landowners but also the productive 
class of laborers, thus giving workers a respected and essential 
position. Ideally, Ledoux wanted to lay out Chaux in concentric 
circles, with the most important functions symmetrically located 
in the center and the least farthest away. An essential component 


of the design had the concentric circles of buildings gradually dis¬ 
solve into the surrounding countryside, thus becoming immersed 
in nature. Homes were often designed based on the dweller s job. 
The river authority’s house, for example, was an enormous seg¬ 
ment of pipe that the Chaux River would have literally run 
through if the house had actually been built (fig. 23.23). 
Hoopmakers would reside in houses shaped like wheels. 
Regardless of the owners rank, each home had an austere

stripped-down geometry that gave it a sense of importance and 
monumentality worthy of a noble civilization. While Ledouxs 
visionary architecture romantically conjured up the power and 
might of long-gone great civilizations, it simultaneously freed 
itself from the architectural vocabulary of the historical past as it 
radically reduced buildings to abstract forms, mutating 
Neoclassicism from a revival of the Classical past to a futuristic 
vision of purity and perfection. 

ETIENNE-LOUIS BOULLEE Ledoux s contemporary Etienne- 
Louis Boullee (1728-1799) shared his quest to create a monumen¬ 
tal architecture using a basically abstract vocabulary. Like 
Ledoux, he did not go to Italy and took his cue from Piranesi, 
Neufforge, and Peyre. After a modest career designing relatively 
severe Palladian hotels , he retired in 1782 to teach at the Royal 
Academy of Architecture, which gave him considerable influence 
over the next generation of architects throughout Europe. He also 
designed and published visionary structures that were so imprac¬ 
tical they could never be built, which he knew. They are impor¬ 
tant nonetheless because they reflect the growing taste for the 
sublime that was welling up in France by the 1780s and that could 
be expressed, if not in real buildings, then at least on paper. 

One of Boullee s most famous visions is his design for a tomb 
for Isaac Newton (fig. 23.24). Conceived as a 500-foot-high 
hollow sphere resting in three concentric circles, it was meant to 
suggest a planet tracking three orbits. The top quarter or so of the 
orb was perforated with small holes to allow in light, making the 
ceiling from inside look like a night sky filled with stars. Below 
lay Newton s cenotaph, dwarfed by the immense scale of the 
structure and lost in the low lighting. The dramatic shadows and 
dark clouds of Boullee s drawing augment the frightening monu- 
mentality of his structure and help transform the edifice into an 


awesome meditation on the power of universal forces and the 
insignificance of human existence. How ironic that Boullee 
should conceive of such a sublime building using a rational, 
geometric vocabulary—and have meant it to honor one of the 
most logical thinkers of all time. 

Painting and Sculpture: 

Expressing Enlightenment Values 

There was no parallel in French history painting to the swing 
toward Classicism occurring in French architecture in the 1750s 
and 1760s. Until the 1780s, the Enlightenment emphasis on 
reason and morality was best presented not by history painting 
but by the lower stratum of genre painting. In sculpture, it 
appeared in portraiture. 

JEAN-BAPTISTE GREUZE One artist alone created the vogue 
for genre painting, Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805), and from 
1759 until the 1770s his scenes of everyday life were the sensation 
of the Paris Salons. The Salon was an exhibition of members of 
the Royal Academy held in the Louvre. While conceived in the 
seventeenth century, the show was held only a handful of times 
before 1737, when it was first instituted as an annual that gradu¬ 
ally evolved into a biennial presented in the Salon carre of the 
Louvre, hence its name. Pictures literally wallpapered the high 
walls, with smaller works and landscapes appearing at eye level, 
above which hung portraits, and above them, enormous history 
paintings. A narrow staircase leading to the Salon was packed 
with small still lifes and genre scenes. The Salons, which opened 
on August 25, the feast-day of St. Louis, and lasted between three 
and six weeks, were attended by some 20,000 to 100,000 people, 
who came from all strata of society, resulting in bakers and

blacksmiths literally rubbing shoulders with dukes and duchesses 
in the crowded room. With the Salons critics emerged, their 
commentaries, often scathing, appearing in brochures that were 
generally published anonymously 

Greuze emerged from a working-class background in the 
Lyon region and went to Paris in the mid-1750s to make his mark 
at the Royal Academy A wealthy collector sponsored a trip to 
Italy for him from 1755 to 1759, but Greuze left Paris a genre and 
portrait painter and returned as one as well. Nonetheless, he 
became the rage of Paris with The Village Bride (fig. 23.25), his 
submission to the Salon of 1761, which shows a Protestant wed¬ 
ding the moment after a father has handed his son-in-law a dowry, 
dutifully recorded by a notary, seated on the right. The scene 
seethes with virtue as the various members of this neat, modest, 
hardworking religious family express familial love, dedication, 
and respect. Here is the social gospel of Rousseau: The nai've poor, 
in contrast to the more cultivated, yet immoral aristocracy, are 


closer to nature and thus full of “natural” virtue and honest sen¬ 
timent. Greuze draws a parallel between the human family and 
the hen and her chicks, each with one member separated, thus 
reinforcing the point about the natural instinct of common folk. 
Critics and public alike raved about the authenticity of the ges¬ 
tures and emotions, comparing them favorably with those of the 
noble figures of Poussin (see fig. 21.5). While Greuze was cer¬ 
tainly attempting to match the intensity of emotion and gesture 
found in history painting, he was also inspired by contemporary 
theater, which accounts for the arrangement of the figures in a 
tableau vivant (a “living painting,” when actors onstage freeze as 
in a painting to portray a pregnant moment) just as the father is 
declaiming his poignant speech about the sanctity of marriage. 

Greuze was also heavily influenced by his friend Diderot, who 
championed him in his Salon reviews, which appeared anony¬ 
mously in the Correspondence litteraire , a paper circulated pri¬ 
vately throughout Europe and Russia. (See Brimary Source , page

OURCE 


Denis Diderot (1713-1784) 

- From Salon of1763, Greuze 

Diderot's reviews of the biennial Salons, published in the outlawed 
newspaper Correspondence litteraire, are generally considered the 
beginning of art criticism. The fill title of the painting discussed below 
is The Paralytic Succoured by His Children, or The Fruit of a Good 
Education, which was subsequently acquired by Catherine II of Russia, 
with Diderot acting as intermediary. In a setting similar to The Village 
Bride, Greuze placed in the painting a paralyzed old man being affec¬ 
tionately attended by his large family. 



N ow here is the man for my money, this Greuze fellow. Ignoring 
for the moment his smaller compositions ... I come at once to 
his picture Filial Piety , which might better have been entitled the 
Reward for Providing a Good Uphringing. 

To begin with, I like this genre: it is a painting with a moral. Come, 
now, you must agree! Don’t you think the painter s brush has been 
employed long enough, and too long, in the portrayal of debauchery 
and vice? Ought we not to be glad to see it competing at last with 
dramatic poetry in moving us, instructing us, correcting us, and 
encouraging us to virtue? Courage, Greuze, my friend; you must go 
on painting pictures like this one! 


812.) In his painting, Greuze perfectly captures Diderots drame 
bourgeois , the new sentimental theater that this philosophe devel¬ 
oped in the 1750s and that focused on ordinary middle-class 
people. As important as the bourgeois settings and sentimentality 
supporting virtue is Diderot s Enlightenment emphasis on logic 
and naturalism in theater. The dialogue was to be in prose, not 
verse, and the actors were to be instructed to stay in character and 
play to each other, not to the audience, which would destroy the 
illusion of reality. In other words, he wanted the audience to 
forget they were in a theater and be transported to the world of 
his drama. Likewise, Greuze wanted his viewers to forget the 
gallery they were standing in as they became immersed in the 
scene he magically painted. 

Largely derived from Dutch and Flemish genre painting and 
certainly playing to an audience that loved Chardin s illusionism 
(see page 769), The Village Bride is filled with realistic detail, 
including attention to textures. The figures are individualized, 
rather than portrayed as ideal types: They are so real that when 
Greuze used them again in later paintings, the public decided it 
was witnessing the continuation of the story of the same family. 
As we shall see, Greuze s realism and morality as well as his preg¬ 
nant tableau vivant moment will figure prominently in French 
Neoclassicism when it emerges some 20 years later. 

JEAN - AN TOIN E HOUDON The French sculptor who perhaps 
best exemplifies Enlightenment empiricism is Jean-Antoine 
Houdon (1741-1828). Both Greuze and Houdon used realism in 
their works, but Houdon, unlike Greuze, incorporated realism 
into a facade of Classicism. Son of the concierge at the Royal 
Academy school and thus literally growing up in the academy, he 
had little education but was extremely hardworking. His artistic 
vision was not given to flights of fantasy; rather, it was firmly 
rooted in Enlightenment empiricism. The elegant, mythological 
frolics of Clodion (see fig. 22.12) and the complex allegories 
favored by many French sculptors were foreign to his sensibility. 
Instead he approached the world scientifically. While a pensioner 
at the French Academy in Rome from 1765 to 1768, Houdon 
studied realistic Roman portrait busts, not idealized Greek sculp¬ 
ture, and in 1767 he executed in plaster a life-size flayed male 


torso revealing in detail every muscle of the body while it leans 
against a support in perfect contrapposto, like Praxiteles’ Hermes 
(see fig. 5.57).

Etienne- Jean Delecluie 
(1781-1863) 

From Louis David, son ecole et son temps 

In the early 1820s, David related the following to his student Etienne- 
Jean Delecluze, who published it in his 1855 hook on David. Here, 
David describes the impact his 1779 discovery of Caravaggio and the 
Caravaggisti had on him. He ends his statement, however, by renounc¬ 
ing Caravaggio and embracing Raphael, an attitude that refects a shifi 
in style in his late work. 

W hen I arrived in Italy, the most striking characteristic of the 
Italian pictures I saw was the vigor of the color and the shad¬ 
ows. It was the quality most radically opposed to the weakness of 


French painting; this new relationship between light and dark, this 
imposing vivacity of modeling, of which I had no idea, impressed me 
to such an extent that in the early days of my stay in Italy, I thought 
the whole secret of art consisted in reproducing, as had certain Italian 
colorists at the end of the sixteenth century, the bold uncompromis¬ 
ing modeling that we see in nature. ... I could understand and appre¬ 
ciate nothing but the brutally executed but otherwise commendable 
pictures of Caravaggio, Ribera, and Valentin who was their pupil. 
There was something barbarous about my taste, my formation, even 
my intelligence; I had to get rid of this quality in order to arrive at the 
state of erudition, or purity, without which one can certainly admire 
the Stanze of Raphael, but vaguely, without understanding, and with¬ 
out the ability to profit from them. 


Source: Anita Brookner, Jacques-Louis David (New York: Harper & Row, 1 980) 




As would be expected of such an empirical mentality, Houdon 
specialized in portraits, and he became portraitist in chief to the 
Enlightenment, depicting virtually every one of the era s major 
personalities, including Diderot, Rousseau, Louis XVI, Catherine 
II of Russia, and Benjamin Franklin. Houdon s uncanny ability to 
capture both the look and essential character of his sitter is appar¬ 
ent in Voltaire Seated (fig. 23.26), here shown as a terra-cotta cast 
from the original plaster, which is lost. The sculptor classicizes his 
sitter by dressing him in a Roman toga and headband, and seating 
him in an antique-style chair. But then Houdon s empiricism 
takes over. He gives us the sagging folds of skin on Voltaire s neck, 
the sunken toothless mouth, the deep facial wrinkles, and the 
slumping shoulders, all of which mark the sitter s age and frailty. 
Simultaneously, Houdon has brilliantly seized the philosophers 
sharp intellect and wit: The head is turning and the mouth smil¬ 
ing, and while one hand droops over the arm of the chair, suggest¬ 
ing age, the other grasps it firmly. 

The Climax of Neoclassicism: 

The Paintings of Jacques-Louis David 

The reign of genre painting in Enlightenment France was short, 
with Greuze s popularity peaking by 1765. The tide began to turn 
toward history painting in 1774 when Charles-Claude d’Angiviller 
was appointed director-general of buildings by Louis XVI. It 
became his personal mission to snuff out what he considered 
Rococo licentiousness and replace it with moralistic history 
painting. Beginning in 1777, he regularly commissioned “grand 
machines,” as these enormous oils were called (they required spe¬ 
cial installation equipment), based on the noble and virtuous 
deeds of the ancients as well as exemplary moments from French 
history, which included a number of pictures set in the Middle 
Ages and Renaissance. The resulting paintings are largely forgot¬ 
ten today, but the project triggered a quest, and even a heated 
competition, among artists to produce the great history painting. 
The fruit of d’Angiviller s program appeared in the mid-1780s 


with the emergence of Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), whose 
images were so revolutionary they have virtually come to epito¬ 
mize Neoclassicism, thus simplifying a very complex period and 
a very complicated term that encompasses much more than 
David s style. 

It took David almost two decades to find his artistic voice, his 
distinctive mature style. He began his studies at the Royal 
Academy school in 1766. He did not win the Rome Prize until 
1774, and then studied in Rome from 1775 to 1781. His progress 
was painfully slow, and he only seemed to find himself in 1780 
after copying a painting the year before of a Last Supper by 
Valentin de Bologne, a French follower of Caravaggio, in the 
Palazzo Barberini. De Bologne s powerful naturalism and dra¬ 
matic lighting, which carved out crisp sculptural figures and 
objects, triggered something in him (see Primary Source above), 
and in 1781 he submitted to the academy a painting of the Roman 
general Belisarius that incorporated this newly discovered aes¬ 
thetic world. The work became his academic acceptance piece and 
garnered him a large following of students. It also won him his 
first major commission from d’Angiviller. 

It took David three years to complete d’Angiviller s commis¬ 
sion, The Oath of the Horatii (fig. 23.27), which he finished in Rome 
in 1784. When David unveiled The Oath in his Rome studio, it 
instantly became an international sensation, with an endless proces¬ 
sion of visitors filing through to see this revolutionary work. The 
Oath arrived in Paris from Rome a few days after the opening of the 
1784 Salon, its delayed grand entrance enhancing the public clamor. 

The theme for the picture comes from a Roman seventh- 
century BCE story found in both Livy and Plutarch recounting 
how a border dispute between Rome and neighboring Alba was 
settled by a sword fight involving three soldiers from each side. 
Representing Rome were the three Horatii brothers, and Alba the 
three Curiatii brothers. Complicating the story, a Horatii sister, 
Camilla, was engaged to a Curiatii brother, while one of the 
Horatii brothers was married to a Curiatii sister. Only Horatius 
of the Horatii brothers survived the violent fight, and David was 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 81 3 


OUR 



instructed by d’Angiviller to paint the moment when Horatius 
returns home and slays his sister after she curses him for killing 
her fiance. Instead, David painted a scene that does not appear in 
the literature: the Horatii, led by their father, taking an oath to 
fight to the death. The composition is quite simple and striking: 
David contrasts the virile stoic men, their bodies locked in rigor¬ 
ous determination, with the slack, curvilinear heap of the dis¬ 
tressed women, Camilla and the Curiatii wife, who, either way, 
will lose a brother, husband, or fiance. 

David was undoubtedly inspired by the many oath-taking 
paintings that had appeared since Gavin Hamilton had made an 
Oath of Brutus in 1764. The dramatic, pregnant moment, which 
David made one of the hallmarks of Neoclassical history painting, 
allowed him to create a tableau vivant championing noble and 
virtuous action dedicated to the supreme but necessary sacrifice 
of putting state before family. The severity of the Horatii s dedi¬ 
cation is reinforced by the severity of the composition. It can be 
seen in the austerity of the shallow space, and even in David s 


selection of stark, baseless Tuscan Doric columns, which Ledoux 
had made fashionable in France the decade before. It also appears 
in the relentless planarity that aligns figures and architecture par¬ 
allel to the picture plane and in the harsh geometry of the floor, 
arches, and grouping of the warriors. It surfaces as well in the 
sharp linear contours of the figures, making them seem as solid 
and frozen as statues. In his planarity and linearity, David is more 
“Poussiniste” than his idol Poussin, from whom he borrows 
figures. Line and geometry, the vehicles of reason, now clearly 
prevail over the sensual color and brushwork of the Rococo. 

But it is the Caravaggesque naturalism and intensity that make 
this image so powerful and distinguish it from Renaissance and 
Baroque Classicism. Sharpening edges and heightening the drama 
of the painting is a harsh light that casts precise shadows, an effect 
derived from Caravaggio (see fig. 19.2), as is the attention to tex¬ 
tures and such details as chinks in the floor marble. The picture is 
startlingly lifelike, with the setting and costumes carefully 
researched to re-create seventh-century BCE Rome.

814 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 











While The Oath is generally perceived as the quintessential 
Neoclassical picture, one of several David made that came to 
define the style, it is filled with undercurrents of Romanticism. 
It is a horrific scene, one that frightened onlookers, sending chills 
down their spines. This is not just an image of moral resolve and 
logic, reflecting the words of Cassius when he declares in 
Voltaire s play Death of Caesar that “a true republican s only 
father and sons are virtue, the gods, law, and country.” Under 
the frozen Neoclassical stillness of this scene lies the tension of 
the bloodbath soon to come. We see this in the father s brightly 
lit fingers, which echo the stridency of the swords. This enormous 
13-foot painting is about the impending violence, from which 
the woman in the ominous background shadow tries to shield 
the children. 


David was a rabid revolutionary once the French Revolution 
began in 1789, and he became a powerful figure in the new repub¬ 
lic when it was established in 1792. He was a member of the 
National Convention, the legislative assembly holding executive 
power in the early years of the French Republic, and was in 
charge of artistic affairs, in effect becoming the republic s minister 
of propaganda. He voted to execute the king, sent the revolution¬ 
ary leader Georges-Jacques Danton to the guillotine, and success¬ 
fully closed the Royal Academy. He was too busy signing arrest 
warrants and death sentences to make much art at the time. 

Two major works from the early 1790s, however, are portraits 
of assassinated revolutionaries and were conceived as pendants. 
Only one survives: The Death of Marat (fig. 23.28), which was 
exhibited with its mate at the Louvre in May 1793, after which the

government declared it would hang in perpetuity in the hall of the 
National Convention. The picture was propaganda. Marat was a 
deputy in the National Convention and the editor of a populist 
newspaper. He was a dedicated revolutionary and a defender of 
the people. But he was also a ruthless man, who was hated and 
feared. He was so despised that a counterrevolutionary from 
Caen, one Charlotte Corday, plunged a knife into his chest while 
he was writing on a portable desk laid across his bathtub, where 
he spent most of his time due to a lethal skin condition that 
grossly disfigured him. 

David, who had visited Marat the day before, shows him 
expiring in the tub, still holding in one hand the quill with which 
he defended the French Republic, and in the other the fake peti¬ 
tion Corday used to divert his attention before stabbing him. Like 
The Oath , David presented this scene with realism, attention to 
detail, sharp lighting, and planarity. But now he pushes the image 
much closer to the picture plane, almost to the surface of the can¬ 
vas, with Marat s writing crate and Corday s blood-stained knife 
dramatically thrust into the viewer s space and the figure of Marat 
just inches behind.

To contemporaries, this must have seemed like modern 
reportage. No matter that it was a propagandist^ lie. Marat s 
bathroom was quite lavish, not the monastic republican interior 
seen here, which is so frugal the sheets are patched and a crate is 
used as a writing surface. Marat was notoriously unattractive, but 
here he has the physique of a Greek god and a seraphic face. The 
pose of the slumped arm is unmistakably that of Christ in a 
Deposition, Lamentation, or Pieta scene (see figs. 16.12 and 
17.37), and derives from a Pieta by Davids student Anne-Louis 
Girodet made the year before. The sheets recall Christ s shroud. 
The mundane writing crate is elevated to a time-worn tombstone. 
Like West in The Death of General Wolfe (see fig. 23.6), David 
appropriated religious iconography for secular glorification. He 
has also given the picture a personal twist, for on the crate he has 
written “A Marat” (“To Marat”) with his signature below. 
Although a commission, the painting was one that David, as a 
member of the government, in a sense commissioned from him¬ 
self, and one that he wanted to make. The dedication certainly 
makes the picture seem like a personal statement, almost a decla¬ 
ration that the powerful emotions expressed in it are particular to 
him as much as they are an expression of collective grief. The look 
of the painting has roots in a long Classical tradition going back 
to Poussin, Raphael, Caravaggio, and antiquity, but its personal 
intensity, as we shall see, is not far removed from that of the 
Romantic era, which is looming just around the corner and will be 
the subject of Chapter 24. 

Neoclassical Portraiture: 

Marie-Louise-Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun 

The impact of Davids Neoclassicism was powerful, not just 
on history painting but portraiture as well. We can see this impact 
on the 1789 Self-Portrait with Daughter (fig. 23.29) by Marie- 
Louise-Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun (1755-1842). Born in Paris to a 
father who was a minor painter and who died when she was 12, 
Vigee-Lebrun, as a woman, was denied access to the Royal 
Academy. Consequently, she was essentially self-taught. In her 
teens, she began painting portraits, which were illegal since she 
did not have a license from the academy, which forced her to seek 
admission to the less prestigious Academy of St. Luke, where 
she exhibited in 1774. The following year, in a marriage of con¬ 
venience, she wed Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Lebrun, a painter and 
prominent art dealer, who gave her access to powerful contacts. 
Her exceptional talent, vibrant personality, and sophistication 
soon had her circulating among the aristocracy and the wealthy, 
and she became a favorite of Queen Marie-Antoinette, whose 
portrait she painted many times, beginning in 1778. Thanks to the 
queens influence, the Royal Academy in 1783 accepted her as a 
painter of historical allegory. 

Lebrun is generally labeled a Rococo painter, her portraits 
having an affableness, liveliness, intimacy, and colorful palette 
associated with the style (see page 761). But throughout her 
career, Vigee-Lebrun was attuned to the latest artistic fashions, 
and she was a forceful arbiter in the world of couture, introducing, 



816 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



for example, shawls, and making “an arrangement with broad 
scarfs lightly intertwined around the body and on the arms, which 
was an attempt to imitate the beautiful drapings of Raphael and 
Domenichino,” as she said in her memoirs. Vigee-Lebrun s 1789 
portrait of herself with her daughter reflects the taste for the 
Classical that was then becoming pervasive in Paris. (In 1788, 
Vigee-Lebrun famously gave a souper grec , or Greek supper, con¬ 
sidered one of the great social events of the reign of Louis XVI.) 
In this portrait, we see the sitters attired a la antique, wearing 
togas, Vigee-Lebrun s cinched above the waist with a scarf. The 
artist wears an antique headband and sports a Roman-style coif¬ 
fure. Instead of a lavish Rococo interior, she and her daughter 
pose against an austere, although warm, wall. 

Vigee-Lebrun loved her daughter, but the powerful intimacy 
and affectionate nature of the scene should also be seen as a reflec¬ 
tion of the new Rousseauian attitude toward children that called 
for greater parental involvement in child-rearing, a quality that 
was increasingly apparent in portraiture in the second half of the 
century as young children began to be featured more frequently 
in portraits with their parents. But despite these Neoclassicisms 
and Enlightenment influences, this spectacular painting still 
retains an undercurrent of the Rococo, seen in its warm colors, 
affable glances, soft Correggioesque contours, and curvilinear 
patterning of arms and drapery. 


Antonio Canova. Canova emerged in Rome in the 1780s, and by 
the 1790s he was the most famous sculptor in the world, receiving 
commissions from all over Europe and America. He was the artist 
the majority of sculptors in both the Old and New World emu¬ 
lated and tried to equal, deep into the nineteenth century. 

Neoclassical Sculpture: Antonio Canova 

Antonio Canova (1757-1822) came from a family of stonecutters 
in the region around Venice. When he was nine his artistic talent 
was brought to the attention of a Venetian senator, under whose 
patronage he was able to study sculpture in Venice, becoming a 
teenage prodigy. By 1780, he was in Rome, financed by the 
Venetian senate, and the following year he took the city by storm 
with his marble sculpture Theseus Vanquishing the Minotaur. The 
work was a sensation in part because it looked Classical, like an 
excavated sculpture, although it was not based on a specific 
antique source—it was entirely Canova s creation. 

We can see Canovas originality in Cupid and Psyche (fig. 
23.30), commissioned in 1787 by a tourist for his home in Britain. 
Canova first modeled the work in plaster, and then had assistants 
rough it out in marble. Afterward he completed the carving, 
which included creating an impressive variety of surface textures,

ITALIAN NEOCLASSICISM 
TOWARD 1 785 

This chapter began in Rome toward 1760, and our story comes 
full circle by ending there as well, toward 1785, no longer looking 
at foreigners, such as Mengs and Hamilton, but at an Italian sculp¬ 
tor. It took over 20 years for Neoclassical painting to crystallize 
into a distinctive style in the work of David, and the same 
happened almost simultaneously in sculpture in the work of 


CHAPTER 23 ART IN THE AGE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, 1 750-1 789 81 7 



23.31 Antonio Canova, Tomb of the Archduchess 
Maria Christina , Augustinerkirche, Vienna. 
1798-1805. Marble, life-size 



especially the remarkable cold-perfect finish for flesh that was 
often copied but never equaled by his many imitators. Nor did 
anyone match his exquisite compositions of continuous elegant 
contours, which in Cupid and Psyche are visible in the curving 
pattern of the sensuous arms and legs, as well as in the flowing 
drapery and the oval mound gently elevating the figures. 

Canova delivers more than beautiful idealized Classical 
models, more than noble simplicity and calm grandeur—he also 
presents intense emotion. Here, he portrays the moment when 
Cupid, having fallen in love with the human Psyche, gives her a 
kiss that awakens her from the eternal sleep into which she has 
been cast by the jealous Venus. With this kiss, she becomes 
immortal, like Cupid. Canova captures a tenderness and passion 
in both expression and gestures that was unthinkable before 1780, 
and this reflects the interest in states of mind that preoccupied the 
Fuseli circle in Rome in the 1770s and consumed British artists in 
the 1780s. Canova was a close friend of Gavin Hamilton, who in 
addition to introducing Canova to the antiquities of Rome 
undoubtedly brought to his attention the emotional intensity that 
his British colleagues were exploring in their art. 

We can see this emotional intensity stated in a very different 
way in the Tomb of the Archduchess Maria Christina (fig. 23.31) 
in the church of the Augustins in Vienna. One of the many 


commissions that flooded Canova s studio by the 1790s, the mon¬ 
ument projects a chill pallor and deathly silence appropriate to a 
scene of mourning. Classically robed figures with bowed heads, 
one holding an urn supposedly containing ashes, trudge in 
Classical profile ever so slowly into the pyramidal tomb. The cold 
melancholy is reinforced by the severe geometry of the pyramid, 
including its austere Egyptian pylonlike post-and-lintel door. 
Above the door is a sculpture of two flying genii, one holding a 
portrait of the deceased, which is framed by a snake biting its tail, 
a symbol of eternity. On the right, a winged genius of war leans 
on a lion, representing Austria, both mourning the archduchess, 
while the three leftmost figures represent the Three Ages of Life. 
But for the most part, these symbols and allegories are subservient 
to the highly palpable realism of the event, so that we feel as 
though we are watching a real funeral procession taking place in 
real space and time. The scene is so convincing that we believe 
that the archduchess’s ashes are indeed in the urn and the pyramid 
is the actual burial place—in fact, neither is the case, and the 
sculpture is only a monument. Despite Canovas s classicizing 
qualities of ideal beauty and drawing upon the antique, his work, 
like David s, contains a powerful emotional intensity that we have 
seen in early Romanticism and, as we will see in the next chapter, 
are the hallmarks of nineteenth-century Romanticism.

Art in the Age of 
Romanticism, 1789-1848 



T here is no precise moment when neoclassicism was absorbed 

into Romanticism, and Romanticism itself emerged as a full-blown 
movement that dominated Western art. But generally this change is 
ascribed to the turn of the century The word “Romanticism” did not 
appear until 1798, when the German writer and poet Friedrich von Schlegel 


(1772-1829) applied it to poetry. The term itself derived from the 
Gothic novels of such writers as Horace Walpole in England (see 
page 800), which were based on medieval heroic literature called 
romanz in Old French, and projected an aura of gloom that 
became popular in the second half of the eighteenth century. By 
1800, the Western world had begun to sense a fundamental trans¬ 
formation in consciousness occurring, a transformation that 
reached its peak in the first half of the nineteenth century. 

This change in consciousness was an indirect result of the 
upheavals that accompanied the French Revolution, the 
Napoleonic Wars, and the rise of industrialization and urban¬ 
ization. The Enlightenment seemed to have failed. Instead of 
social reform and progress, there was turmoil and dislocation, 
often accompanied by pessimism and a concomitant search for 
truth within the inner self rather than in society. The French 
Revolution may have given rise to republican government, 
political enfranchisement, nationalism, and public institutions, 
including museums, but it had also thrown most of Europe into 
war by 1792 and resulted in the execution of some 17,000 people 
under Robespierre s Reign of Terror in 1793-94. Fearful that 
Enlightenment reform spawned only revolution, European gov¬ 
ernments cracked down on liberals, instituting a harsh reactionary 

Detail of figure 24.24, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Souvenir de 
Mortefontaine (Oise) 


conservatism. The rise of Napoleon Bonaparte from commander 
of the Army of Italy under the Directory to self-proclaimed 
hereditary emperor in 1804 quashed the French Republic and 
initiated the Napoleonic Wars, which at their peak saw France 
occupy most of Europe and lasted until 1815. Napoleons reign 
further increased the fervor of nationalism initiated by the French 
Revolution, and his military campaigns, covered in detail by the 
press, which proliferated in the opening decades of the century, 
provided the public with wondrous tales of valor and excitement 
that fed the Romantic imagination. 

The military needs of war hastened the pace of the Industrial 
Revolution begun in Britain the previous century, and the return 
to peace with the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 hardly served as a 
brake. Waves of people fled the poverty of the countryside for the 
city to work in manufacturing. This new proletariat class, sepa¬ 
rated from the comforting predictability of the timeless rural 
world and needing to sell its labor, now experienced oppressive 
working conditions and subsistence wages, as well as poor hous¬ 
ing in cities not designed to accommodate such a dramatic 
increase in population. The period saw the birth of modern labor 
and worker-management conflict, which culminated in 1848 with 
the publication of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels s Communist 
Manifesto and a Europe-wide workers 5 revolution. The Industrial 
Revolution also gave rise to a powerful bourgeoisie, a wealthy 
middle class that controlled the means of production and 
demanded a greater voice in government. 


CHAPTER 24 ART IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 


821 


CHAPTER 



With this seemingly endless succession of crises, the West found 
a need to believe in something other than the Enlightenment values 
of logic and scientific empiricism. There arose a turning inward to 
the self, and a belief in the subjective emotion of the individual, 
promoted by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in France and the Sturm und 
Drang movement in Germany (see Chapter 23). What had been a 
strong undercurrent in the eighteenth century surfaced as the defin¬ 
ing psychology of the West by the end of the century. Artists, 
writers, composers, and intellectuals now placed a premium on 
powerful emotion, intuition, and unrestrained creative genius. The 
era itself is often described as being dedicated to the "Cult of the 
Individual. ” For the intellectual and cultural elite, total liberation 
of the imagination and creative freedom replaced rules, standards, 
and logic. As expressed by the French Romantic writer Victor 
Hugo, "All systems are false; only genius is true. ” From this per¬ 
spective, the mind was the conduit of nature, the only means of 
accessing elemental universal forces, God, and the goal of the artist 
was to tap into this reservoir of higher reality and express it. Sin¬ 
cerity and truthfulness were therefore now critical. Enlightenment 
morality was not applicable. Powerful emotions in response to 
violence, suffering, chaos, and ugliness replaced virtuous and 
noble actions and the perfection associated with ideal beauty. 
Romanticism produced a cult not only for exotic experiences but 
also for frightening, horrific, and extreme situations. Uniqueness 
became a strong value in art; copying someone else s genius, orig¬ 
inality, or individualism was the manufacture of something false. 


Consequently, Romanticism was not a style, but an attitude. It 
was a license to abandon logic and to follow one s genius wher¬ 
ever it led. It could lead to the distant past, the exotic present, the 
most grotesque and horrific aspects of human behavior, and the 
awesome forces of nature. It also resulted in a welling up of 
nationalistic spirit, as citizens were swept together not out of 
allegiance to a king but to a collective experience and language, 
eventually resulting in the rise of Italy and Germany as united 
countries in 1871. It also meant artists would no longer paint 
idealized Classical arcadias; instead they painted with pride and 
loving detail the countryside in which they themselves grew up, a 
countryside once considered too banal to render but that was now 
an emblem of Gods presence, or filled with the powerful emo¬ 
tions of personal experience. And Romanticism meant artists 
were swept away by the emotions of liberty and freedom, the 
surge toward democracy, which, for example, was the driving 
force behind Ludwig van Beethoven s Symphony Number 3 in C 
Major, The Eroica , of 1804, originally dedicated to Napoleon and 
the civil liberties he instituted before he became emperor. While 
Romanticism may seem stylistically diverse, its attitude was 
cohesive, both passionate and powerful, as reflected in the work 
of some of the great names of the Romantic era: Beethoven, 
Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Frederic Chopin, Lord Byron, Mary 
and Percy Shelley, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William 
Wordsworth, Frangois-Renee de Chateaubriand, Victor Hugo, 
Henri-Marie Stendal, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. 


822 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



















PAINTING 

Of all the visual arts, painting is most closely associated in our 
minds with Romanticism because, unlike sculpture and architec¬ 
ture, it allowed for a spontaneous outpouring of emotion. In fact, 
many art historians think of the study or sketch, whether painted 
or drawn, as the quintessential Romantic medium. While some of 
the most famous Romantic paintings are Baroque in their dra¬ 
matic handling of paint and energetic compositions, Romantic 
paintings can just as readily be tightly painted and composed in 
accordance with Neoclassical planes, resulting in frozen images 
that project chilling emotions. 

Spain: Francisco Goya 

In the opening decades of the nineteenth century, Spanish art was 
dominated by Francisco Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828), an artist 
whose work in many ways encapsulates the new psychology and 
issues pervading Europe. Born and raised in Aragon, he initially 
studied with Anton Raphael Mengs in Madrid. Goya did not 
much care for Mengs, and left to tour Italy in 1770 and 1771. 
Upon returning to Aragon, he studied with the painter Francisco 
Bayeu, developing a colorful, painterly Rococo style. Bayeu, a 
member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Madrid, arranged 
for Goya to design images for the Royal Tapestry Workshop, 
which brought him to Madrid again and gave him access to the 
royal court and Madrid aristocracy. Charles III (r. 1759-1788) 
appointed Goya royal painter in 1786, and his son Charles IV, in 
1789, made him first painter to the king, putting him in the tradi¬ 
tion of Velazquez, who had previously held the position (see page 
691). For Goya, an Enlightened Spaniard who admired the 
French philosophies, there was not necessarily a conflict between 
supporting the monarchy and advocating liberal reform. The king 
recognized the need to bring a stagnant Spain into the eighteenth 
century and permitted a degree of economic and social develop¬ 
ment, which gave hope to the progressive forces. Goya was a 
member of this group that favored social reform, and his social 
circle, including many of his aristocratic clients, shared his out¬ 
look. But the French Revolution terrified heads of state through¬ 
out Europe and ushered in reactionary oppression, for now the 
Enlightenment became associated with revolution, not reform. 
Both Church and State suppressed the liberal reformers. Spain 
went to war with France, forging an alliance with its old enemy, 
Britain. On top of these reversals, Goya fell mysteriously ill in 
1793, only just surviving and going deaf in the process. Now, 
Goya s art focused on exploring the human condition and the 
emerging modern psychology, on exposing wanton cruelty, 
misery, ignorance, and greed as universal constants, and on 
expressing the reality of death as a frightening, unknown void. 

THE SLEEP OF REASON We can get some idea of Goya’s 
reaction to the periods crises by looking at The Sleep of Reason 
Produces Monsters (fig. 24.1), one of 80 etching-and-aquatint 
prints from the series Los Caprichos (The Capriccios ), conceived

by the artist in 1797 and published at his own expense at a finan¬ 
cial loss. Here, we see the artist asleep on the geometric block of 
reason, while behind him rises an ominous disarray of owls and 
bats, symbols of folly and ignorance, respectively. In the margin 
of a study for this image, Goya wrote, “The author s...intention 
is to banish harmful beliefs commonly held, and with this work of 
caprichos to perpetuate the solid testimony of truth.” This print 
introduces the second half of the series, which satirizes a range of 
sins, superstitions, and forms of ignorance, and is populated with 
witches, monsters, and demons, in effect showing what the world 
is like when Enlightenment logic is suspended. 

But it is just as easy to interpret The Sleep of Reason as expos¬ 
ing a second, non-Enlightenment side to Goya s personality—the 
emotional and illogical rather than the rational. We sense that the 
owls and bats, rather than being real, are released from the inner 
recess of Goya s mind, so that this nightmarish scene becomes an 
expression of the artist s own emotional state of despair or horror 


CHAPTER 24 ART IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 823 







at the terrible turn of events transforming the Western world. In 
effect, in The Capriccios Goya is announcing his right to abandon 
reason and use his imagination to express his deepest feelings, his 
innermost psychology—to free his demons and employ whatever 
stylistic tools and symbols he needs in order to do so. We are now 
far from Neoclassicism and the Rococo as we enter a dramatic 
graphic world energized by Baroque contrasts of light and dark, 
asymmetrical composition, the febrile patterning of the wings of 
bats and owls, and the rasping lines of the Goya’s rich intaglio 
process. (See Materials and Techniques , page 501.) 

ROYAL COMMISSIONS Goya continued to work for Church 
and State, which, in addition to painting portraits, is how he 
earned a living. In 1800, the king commissioned him to paint The 
Family of Charles TV (fig. 24.2). This work is hardly a simple doc¬ 
umentation of the royal family’s likeness. And it is certainly not a 
grand machine designed to reaffirm the family’s divine privilege 
and superiority, for the painting undermines this traditional 
premise by exposing their basic humanness, their ordinariness. 
The key to interpreting the picture is knowing that Goya meant it 
to be compared with Velazquez’s The Maids of Honor (see fig. 
19.38), a picture in the royal collection and known to everyone at 
court. In each painting, the artist is present and the royal family 
appears before a shadowy backdrop of two large oils. In addition, 
Goya s Queen Maria Luisa, standing in the center, strikes the 
same pose as Velazquez’s infanta. Missing from Goya’s portrait, 
however, is the all-important mirror, which in The Maids of 


Honor reveals the royal parents, the keystone that holds the pic¬ 
ture together compositionally and thematically because it not 
only explains the scene but also establishes the hierarchical order 
of the figures. But where is the mirror in Charles TV ? We must 
ask another question first, one that is always posed about Goya’s 
picture: What is everyone gaping at so intently? The most likely 
answer is themselves. They are looking in a mirror—the unac¬ 
counted-for mirror—and Goya, standing behind his sitters, 
shows himself painting their reflection as they see themselves. 

Theophile Gautier, a nineteenth-century French critic, clev¬ 
erly noted their discomfort when he described the royal couple as 
looking like “the corner baker and his wife after they have won 
the lottery. ” Goya reduces his sitters to human animals, uncom¬ 
fortable with themselves. Their clothes may be royal, but the 
family members are as awkward in them as in their false aristo¬ 
cratic poses, which lack the assuredness we saw in royal portraits 
by Van Dyck and Rigaud (see figs. 20.8 and 21.10). The figures 
appear lonely, isolated, even afraid. Goya presents each one as an 
individual, plagued by the same doubts about the meaning of exis¬ 
tence and the same sense of alienation that haunt all humans. This 
Romantic sense of awe when confronting the infinite is Goya’s 
creation, superimposed onto the royal family. Based on the prin¬ 
ciple of empiricism, many Enlightenment philosophes denied the 
existence of God, which the French Revolution did as well, sup¬ 
pressing the Catholic Church. Without God and religion, the 
meaning of existence is unknowable and beyond comprehension. 
This shockingly modern psychology casts a dark shadow over the

room. Surprisingly, Charles IV did not reject the portrait, 
although he did not particularly like it either. Conceivably, the 
royal family overlooked the disturbing truths lying beneath the 
surface of the picture because they were blinded by Goya s bril¬ 
liant flamboyant brushwork (difficult to see in reproduction), 
which surpassed even Velazquez’s Baroque bravura. Goyas 
dynamic paint handling animates the surface—it is sparkling and 
dazzling, especially as seen in the clothes, jewelry, and medals. 

An even more powerful mood of futility pervades The Third 
of May, 1808 (fig. 24.3), painted in 1814 and one of many paint¬ 
ings, drawings, and prints that Goya made from 1810 to 1815 in 
response to the French occupation of Spain in 1808. The corrup¬ 
tion of the Spanish administration forced Charles IV to abdicate 
in 1807. He was replaced by his son Ferdinand VII, who was 
deposed in 1808 when Napoleons troops marched into Madrid 
and put the emperor’s brother, Joseph Bonaparte, on the throne. 
Enlightened Spain was initially optimistic that the Enlightened 
French would bring political reform. But in Madrid a people’s 
uprising spurred by nationalism resulted in vicious fighting and 
wholesale slaughter on both sides, within days fanning out across 
the entire country and then dragging on for six years. Goya s enor¬ 
mous, dramatic picture, painted after Napoleon had been deposed 
and Ferdinand reinstated, shows the mass execution of Spanish 
rebels that took place on May 3, 1808, on a hill outside Madrid. 

How different it is from Neoclassical history painting that 
presented great and famous exemplars of nobleness, morality, and 
fortitude! Goya presents anonymous nobodies caught up in the 
powerful forces of history Here we see the mechanical process of 
the slaughter. One rebel with raised arms, dressed in the yellow 
and white colors of the papacy has the pose of Christ on the 
Cross. His right hand has a wound suggesting the stigmata. But 


ironically Goya denies the rioters the status of martyrs. They are 
consumed by the fear of death, not the ecstasy of sacrifice. No 
divine light materializes to resurrect them, and the church in the 
background of this imaginary scene remains dark. When the sta¬ 
ble lantern—which in its geometry and light could be construed 
as an emblem of Enlightenment logic and progress—is extin¬ 
guished, there will be only eternal night, symbolized by the inert 
foreground body whose face is reduced to a gory mass of paint. 
The faceless executioners, also small cogs in the wheel of history 
are indifferent to their victims’ fear of death and frantic pleas 
for mercy Goya whips up the horror and emotional turmoil of 
his scene by rejecting tight Neoclassical paint handling, linearity 
planarity and even lighting, and by replacing this aesthetic with 
feverish loose brushwork, intense colors, compositional turmoil 
on the left, and a dramatically receding line of soldiers on the right. 

Goya painted The Third of May, 1808 at a time when he was 
desperate for work: He wanted to gain royal favor with this pic¬ 
ture, hence his scripting of it so that it could be read as being 
about the sacrifice of the Spanish to the agents of political 
tyranny But the real themes of the image are the anonymity of 
death and the senseless brutality of war. Its power lies in its abil¬ 
ity to instill in a viewer an intense sense of terror that makes one 
confront the inescapable knowledge of ones own mortality. 

Britain: Spiritual Intensity 
and the Bond with Nature 

The road taken by Goya in Los Caprichos into a fantasy world 
that allowed his imagination and passions to go wild was most 
closely followed in Britain by William Blake, who viewed himself 
as a history painter. However, many British painters during the 


CHAPTER 24 ART IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 825 





Romantic era took the same path as Romantic poets such as 
William Wordsworth (1770-1850) and Percy Bysshe Shelley 
(1792-1822) and steeped themselves in nature, being emotionally 
swept away by its beauties and moods or awed by its sublime 
power and intimations of the infinite. 

WILLIAM BLAKE Across the English Channel in London, the 
artist William Blake (1757-1827) was also retreating into a per¬ 
sonal visual world as he responded to issues very similar to those 
affecting Goya. Blake was an ardent admirer of Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau and his theories about the inherent goodness of humans, 
who are born innocent primitives before becoming corrupted by 
the restrictive artificialities of society. He detested European 
civilization for its rules and conventions, which he felt hindered 
personal freedom, including equality for women. He loathed 
European materialism and its lack of spirituality, and condemned 
institutional religion for being as autocratic as government and 
society in general. His passion to find spiritual truths in a physi¬ 
cal world led him to flirt with fringe religions in the 1780s. 


Blake began his career as an artisan engraver. He then enrolled 
in the Royal Academy in 1779 but left within a year, declaring its 
president, Joshua Reynolds, and the institution itself a microcosm 
of society, repressing imagination, creativity, and progress. As a 
result, he was largely self-taught. While never a recluse, Blake was 
quite insular, functioning on the edge of society. He did not show 
at the academy after the mid-1780s and received virtually no 
critical notice throughout his career. 

Despite his intense dislike of the Royal Academy, Blake was a 
proponent of history painting, which he saw as a vehicle for 
reforming society. However, he shunned oil painting, which he 
associated with the artificial hierarchies of the academy, and 
instead turned to medieval manuscript illumination for inspira¬ 
tion, producing illustrated books of his own poetry that were 
designed to evoke the same kind of spirituality found in his 
model. Before becoming a visual artist, Blake was a poet, garner¬ 
ing an impressive reputation. In the late 1780s, he started self- 
publishing his poetical works, which praised nature, freedom, 
youth, and imagination while denouncing the corruption of all

826 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 














Blake’s Printing Process 

F or the series of 1 2 prints that included Elohim Creating Adam (see 
fig. 24.4), William Blake invented a process that is similar to mono¬ 
type, a printing technique that would become popular by the end of 
the nineteenth century but was rarely used earlier. Monotype involves 
painting an image on one surface and then pressing paper against this 
wet surface to attain a counterimage, which unlike the original has a 
mottled, softer-looking surface. As the word monotype implies, gener¬ 
ally only one impression is taken. However, a few impressions can 
be obtained before all of the original paint is consumed, with each 
successive image lighter than the previous. 


Blake’s process for the series was to first outline his image in black 
paint on a piece of millboard (a thick paperboard), often adding a small 
amount of modeling and detail as well. He would pull roughly three 
paper impressions from the millboard, using low pressure so as not to 
extract too much paint at one time. This would produce a simple black 
design without color. To finish his image, he would paint the millboard 
again but with colors, and press it on top of the pulled impressions 
with the black design. He then touched up the works with watercolor. 
Blake is said to have used oil paint for his printing, but considering his 
distaste for the medium he most likely used an egg-based tempera. 


components of civilization, a corruption stemming from an over¬ 
reliance on reason. Toward 1793-94, Blake spiraled into a deep 
depression, triggered by the violence and chaos of the French 
Revolution, Britain's declaration of war on France, and the 
repressive policies that British Prime Minister William Pitt 
instituted in response to the most radical phase of the French 
Revolution. Like Goya, Blake was witnessing the failure of the 
Enlightenment. 

At this point the visual imagery began to dominate the poetry 
in Blakes books. Simultaneously, his art reached maturity in 
twelve unusually large color prints made mostly in 1795, such as 
Elohim Creating Adam (fig. 24.4). These works were never bound 
and presented in book form, so we do not know for sure the order 
in which they were meant to be seen or how Blake intended to use 
them. (See Materials and Techniques , above.) However, all of the 
prints relate to the artist's vision of the early history of the world, 
in which humans, when born, are still attached to the infinite from 
which they have just come, and are morally good, free, and filled 
with imagination. As they age, they begin to be ruled by reason, 
lose their freedom and morality, and become consumed by mate¬ 
rialism, thus trapped in the finite. The subjects for this series are 
not all invented: Some come from Shakespeare, Milton, and the 
Bible, which, as we have discussed (see page 804), were favorite 
sources for sublime imagery in the period. Blake appropriated 
these themes because they could be integrated into his own philo¬ 
sophical system and thus support it. 

Elohim Creating Adam comes from the Bible, Genesis 2:7: 
“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground.'' 
Blake presents Adam's birth as an aspect of the Fall, for this is a 
representation of his material birth, not his spiritual one. His 
body is tense, his face even tortured and apprehensive, and his 
pose is that of Christ on the Cross. Around his legs is a giant 
worm, a symbol of the material world. Elohim, the Hebrew word 
for “Jehovah,” projects an expression of foreboding, knowing full 
well the fate of humans. We need but compare this image to 
Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam (see fig. 16.21) on the Last 


Judgment wall of the Sistine Chapel to see how disturbing and 
negative Blake's presentation is. 

Since the mid-1770s, Blake had been influenced by 
Michelangelo and the Mannerists as well as by medieval art, and 
the presence of all can be detected in this picture, though trans¬ 
formed by Blake's own style. We see Michelangelo's overstated 
musculature (see fig. 16.21), as well as the curvilinear line of 
manuscript illumination (see fig. 10.8). The absence of an environ¬ 
mental setting and the emphasis on figures alone, as well as the 
selection of a sublime, horrifying situation derives from Fuseli 
(see figs. 23.16 and 23.17), whom Blake greatly admired and 
periodically tried to befriend, without success. 

The degree to which Blake mentally immersed himself in his 
fictitious worlds is remarkable. He claimed his visions were 
revealed to him by spirits: “I am under the direction of 
Messengers from heaven, Daily and Nightly ” While we have to 
take this statement with a grain of salt, nonetheless, his art was not 
naturalistic (a faithful representation of reality), but a conceptual 
fantasy world in which he could play out his passionate moral 
beliefs, historical views, and vision of a utopian future. Objects 
are relatively flat, with space kept to a minimum, an artistic strat¬ 
egy that reinforces the ideal concepts behind his images. 

JOHN CONSTABLE Landscape gradually became a major vehi¬ 
cle in the period's search for truth. This is not surprising consid¬ 
ering the importance of nature in Romantic ideology—the need 
to bond with it and to express its essence as personally experi¬ 
enced. John Constable (1776-1837) is one of two British artists 
who stand out in the period for their landscapes. Constable was 
born and raised in the village of East Bergholt, in the Stour Valley 
in Suffolk, and spent most of his life painting this rich farmland, 
which until then had been considered too ordinary to be used as 
artistic subject matter. Instead of working at the family's prosper¬ 
ous farm and mill, Constable, in 1799, was permitted to study at 
the Royal Academy School in London. He eventually realized 
that he was just learning to replicate painting conventions, and 


CHAPTER 24 ART IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 827 


MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 






returned to Bergholt to make “laborious studies from nature,” 
drawings and oil sketches that he worked up into finished pic¬ 
tures in the studio but that retained the freshness and details of the 
original source. Constable even considered painting landscape 
scientific: “Painting is a science, and should be pursued as an 
inquiry into the laws of nature. Why, then, may not landscape 
painting be considered as a branch of natural philosophy, of 
which pictures are but experiments?” Constable was especially 
adept at capturing the ephemeral properties of nature—clouds, 
light, and atmosphere. He made countless studies of just the sky, 
“the key note, standard scale, and chief organ of sentiment. ” 
Constable s pictures are packed with the emotion that welled 
within him when experiencing the beauty of the Stour Valley— 
“painting is with me but another word for feeling,” he claimed. 
(See Primary Source , page 829.) His pictures were both scientific 
and subjective, as in The Haywain ( Landscape: Noon ) (fig. 24.5) of 
1821, shown at the Royal Academy, where he had been exhibiting 
since 1811. We do not just see but feel a blue sky pushing out 
darker clouds, and an invisible layer of moisture that makes 


everything glisten. Vibrant flecks of paint and color dissolve the 
material world and make the atmosphere sparkle. The sky is a 
symphony of subjectivity, presenting a range of emotions, as does 
the land. It can be dark and undulating, as in the dramatic, ener¬ 
gized twisting of tree branches, or bright and placid, as in the 
light-filled horizontal spread of the distant hayfield. Constable 
fills his picture with detailed anecdote; besides the haywain, there 
is the dog, the boat, the harvesters in the distant field, and the 
puffs of smoke coming from the mill. This is no perfect world, 
representing ideal beauty or a Classical Arcadia. Rather, it is a par¬ 
ticular site presented in all of its heartfelt specificity. One of the 
new emotions experienced in the Romantic era was national pride 
and artists now passionately painted their own countries—not 
just the Italian landscape—and they painted it with loving detail, 
not idealized to look like the Classical past. 

The 6-foot canvas—an unusually large size for a genre paint¬ 
ing and a controversial strategy for elevating landscape to a higher 
status as well as an attempt to gain attention—was based on 
numerous outdoor studies, mostly made from 1814 to 1816, and

John Constable (1776-1837) 

From a letter to John Fisher 

Fisher , the archdeacon of Salisbury Cathedral , was a lifelong friend of 
the artist. This letter ofOctoher 23 , 1821 , re fleets Constable's sensitivity 
to the beauties of the English landscape. 

H ow much I wish I had been with you on your fishing excursion 
in the New Forest! What river can it be? But the sound of water 
escaping from mill-dams, etc., willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts, 
and brickwork, I love such things. Shakespeare could make every¬ 


thing poetical; he tells us of poor Toms haunts among “sheep cotes 
and mills.” As long as I do paint, I shall never cease to paint such 
places. They have always been my delight, and I should indeed have 
been delighted in seeing what you describe, and in your company, “in 
the company of a man to whom nature does not spread her volume in 
vain. ” Still I should paint my own places best; painting is with me but 
another word for feeling, and I associate “my careless boyhood” with 
all that lies on the banks of the Stour; those scenes made me a painter, 
and I am grateful; that is, I had often thought of pictures of them 
before I ever touched a pencil.

developed into this large presentation format in the artists 
London studio, where he worked in the winter. Typically for his 
Stour pictures, life in The Haywain moves slowly, with rural 
laborers routinely doing what they have done for millennia in 
blissful harmony with nature. This was a period of social and 
economic unrest in the British agricultural community, putting 
tremendous financial pressure on the Constable property, then 
run by the artists brother. This labor crisis is absent from 
Constables poetic picture, which instead focuses on personal 
attachment to the land and the life the artist knew as a boy. 

JOSEPH MALLORD WILLIAM TURNER The second major 
British landscape artist in this period is Joseph Mallord William 
Turner (1775-1851). In their basic operating premises, Constable 
and Turner could not be further apart. Whereas Constable painted 
with scientific accuracy the land he intimately knew, Turner 
aspired to rival great history painting and consequently invested 
his views with a rich overlay of historical motifs, references to the 
Old Masters, and metaphorical themes. His work was also often 
cataclysmic and horrific, portraying the powerful, uncontrollable 
forces of nature, and giving visual expression to the sublime as 
defined by Burke. 

Turner began his career in the early 1790s as a for-hire topo¬ 
graphical watercolorist. By 1799, at the unprecedentedly young 
age of 24, he became an associate of the Royal Academy. While he 
made numerous landscape studies of specific rural scenes as 
Constable did of Stour, his drive to artistic greatness led him to 
take on the great landscape and marine painters of the past— 
Claude Lorrain and Jacob Ruisdael—whose works his landscapes 
resemble in composition, subject, and atmosphere. The reason for 
this mimicry was to outdo the Old Masters at their own game: 
Turner’s sun was brighter, his atmosphere moister, haze hazier, 
and perspectival space deeper. Like Constable, his handling of the 
intangible properties of nature—wind, light, reflections, atmos¬ 
phere—was magical. 

Turner’s quest for the grandiose and his rich imagination led him 
to embed spectacular mythological and historical moments in his 
landscapes, creating historical landscape on an epic, sublime scale. 
Snowstorm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alp (fig. 24.6) of 
1812 is one of his best-known historical landscapes, a genre he 


had developed by the late 1790s. In this work, the Carthaginian 
general Hannibal leads his troops across the French Alps in 218 BCE 
to launch a surprise attack on the Romans during the Punic Wars. 
A human sea of turmoil reigns in the valley below as Hannibal’s 
troops plunder the alpine villages for desperately needed supplies. 
Above, the cataclysmic forces of nature—a wild snowstorm, 
turbulent wind, crashing storm clouds, and a blinding light from 
an ominous sun—threaten to engulf the insignificant figures 
below, too preoccupied with their immediate survival to notice. 
The great Hannibal is barely present, reduced to a speck on an 
elephant in the background. Dramatic light, diagonal recession, 
and bold brushwork reinforce the chaos and hysteria of the scene. 

During the Napoleonic Wars, Turner made several pictures 
about Carthage, with which, as a great maritime empire, the 
British identified. In Snowstorm , however, the reference is proba¬ 
bly to Napoleons 1800 march across the Alps to invade Italy. 
Whether the precise allusion is to France or Britain probably does 
not matter, for the work’s wider theme is the folly of empire, and 
imperial expansion was a hotly debated issue in both France and 
Britain at the time. The picture is also about the folly of existence. 
When Turner exhibited Snowstorm at the Royal Academy, he 
accompanied it with several lines from his unfinished poem “The 
Fallacies of Hope,” which moralized about the plundering and 
ultimate defeat of Hannibal’s army. This picture, like his later 
Carthage paintings, including the 1817 Decline of the 
Carthaginian Empire , is not meant to glorify or condemn human 
activity. Instead it is designed to put human activity and civiliza¬ 
tion into a grander cosmic scheme, in which they appear insignif¬ 
icant compared to the relentless, uncontrollable power of sublime 
universal forces. Turner’s goal is the Romantic notion of making a 
viewer feel nature’s unfathomable enormity, not to reproduce a 
landscape (although the painting is based on studies he made in 
the Alps). Consequently, an atmospheric haze shrouds the 
insignificant figures and a dramatically receding vortex ends in 
a blaze of eternal light. With Turner, Edmund Burke’s idea of 
the sublime (see page 790) reaches a terrifying pitch. But more 
horrifying than the sheer power of nature are “the fallacies of 
hope,” the Romantic notion of the infinity of the universe and the 
permanency of death, a modern psychology we have already seen 
in Goya.

The direct experience of nature becomes stronger in Turners 
late work. Now, the image begins to disappear, replaced by an 
atmospheric blur of paint and color that seems to sit on the 
surface of the canvas, making a viewer feel immersed in it. Today, 
Turner is best known for this late abstract style, which he devel¬ 
oped toward 1838 and is seen in The Slave Ship or Slavers 
Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying—Typhoon Coming On 
(fig. 24.7) of 1840. These late works were condemned in Turners 
own time. His contemporaries thought he had gone mad, for they 
found the works virtually unreadable, and certainly unintelligible. 
Furthermore, his epic stories were no longer drawn from mythol¬ 
ogy or history but from seemingly minor contemporary events. 
His earlier work may have been atmospheric, but there was 
always enough drawing to suggest precise objects, a distinct com¬ 
position, and legible spatial recession and relationships, as we see 
in Snowstorm. Later, this readability evaporates in a haze of color 
and paint that represents the essence of mist, light, and atmosphere. 

The Slave Ship shows the sick and dying human cargo being 
thrown into the sea during a typhoon. Turner was inspired by 
James Thomsons The Seasons (1730), where the poet describes 
how sharks follow a slave ship during a typhoon, £ Tured by the 
scent of steaming crowds, or rank disease, and death. ” Turner was 
also influenced by a recent newspaper account of a ship s captain 


who had jettisoned slaves in order to collect insurance, which paid 
for cargo lost at sea but not for death from illness. Here, Turner 
gives us a close-up of human suffering. Outstretched hands plead¬ 
ing for help, a leg about to disappear into the deep for a last time, 
the gruesome blackness of flailing chains and manacles, the fren¬ 
zied predatory fish, and bloodstained water all dominate the 
immediate foreground. In the background is the slave ship, head¬ 
ing into the fury of the typhoon and its own struggle for survival, 
its distance and silence a metaphor for the callous indifference of 
the slavers. The searing brilliance of the sun bathes the sky in a 
blood-red aura, its seemingly infinite reach complementing the 
omnipotence of the raging sea. 

This is a tragic, horrific scene, made a few years after Britain 
banned slavery entirely in the Abolition of Slavery Act (1833; the 
Atlantic slave trade had been outlawed in 1807). Turner certainly 
makes us feel the hardened inhumanity of the slavers, encourag¬ 
ing us to despise them. And yet, the picture has a haunting the¬ 
matic and moral ambiguity: Birds eat fish and human carcasses, 
fish feed on other fish and discarded slaves, and slavers fight for 
their lives in the face of a storm. The picture is as much about 
the struggle of daily life and the role of fate as it is about the 
immorality of the slavers, the only constant being the frightening 
power of nature.

Germany: Friedrich } s Pantheistic Landscape 

Human destiny is treated with a chilling bleakness and unsettling 
silence in the sublime landscapes of the German artist Caspar 
David Friedrich (1774-1840). While Turner focuses on the 
insignificance of human and animal life in the face of the all- 
powerful cosmos, Friedrichs concern is the passage from the 
physical way station of earth to the spiritual being of eternity. His 
landscapes are virtually pantheistic (seeing Gods presence in 
nature), an especially German phenomenon, as he invests his 
detailed, realistic scenes with metaphysical properties that give 
them an aura of divine presence. 

Friedrich was born into a prosperous bourgeois family of can¬ 
dle and soap manufacturers in the Baltic harbor town of 
Greifswald, then part of Sweden. Here, he found the austere land¬ 
scape that served as the source material for his drawings and 
formed the foundation of many of his paintings. He studied 
drawing at the Academy of Copenhagen from 1794 to 1797 and 
then continued his training in Dresden, where he would maintain 
a studio throughout his life. Until 1807, he worked exclusively in 
drawing, shunning historical themes and instead making topo¬ 
graphical landscapes, including many of the Baltic region. His 
paintings would retain the hard linear draftsmanship he devel¬ 
oped in these years. 

Gradually his landscape drawings became metaphorical, often 
presented in groupings with cyclical themes, such as the times of 


the day or the four seasons. He continued this practice in his early 
paintings, which include Monk by the Sea , which was paired with 
Abbey in an Oak Forest (fig. 24.8), made in 1809-10. The former, 
which would be hung on the left and read first, pits the small ver¬ 
tical figure of a standing monk, back to viewer, against the vast¬ 
ness of the sea and an overwhelming explosive sky in a landscape 
so barren and abstract that the beach, sea, and sky are virtually 
reduced to vague horizontal bands. Traditionally art historians 
interpret the funeral depicted in Abbey as that of this monk, in 
part because the coffin-bearing Capuchins wear the same habit as 
that of the Monk by the Sea. If the first picture depicts life con¬ 
templating death, the void represented by the sky and sea, this 
second is an image of death, as suggested by a frozen snow- 
covered cemetery a lugubrious funeral procession, distraught 
barren oak trees, the skeletal remains of a Gothic abbey and a 
somber winter sky at twilight. The abbey and oaks, obviously 
equated and imbuing nature with a spirituality and vice versa, 
form a gate that the burial cortege will pass under. Religious hope 
is stated in the crucifix scene mounted on the portal. The oval at 
the peak of the tracery window is echoed by the sliver of new 
moon in the sky a symbol of resurrection. We sense a rite of 
passage, a direct connection, between abbey and sky Just as the 
moon goes through a cycle as it is reborn, twilight yields to night 
followed by sunrise and day, and winter gives way to spring, 
summer, and fall; so also, it is suggested, death will be followed by 
an afterlife or rebirth. And yet, this is a very gloomy picture that

leaves our fate after death in doubt, making us dread the unknown 
on the other side of the horizon. Friedrich s cold, marmoreal paint 
handling reinforces the lifelessness of the scene. 

Friedrich s equating nature with religion was influenced by 
the pantheism of his friend the theologian Gotthard Ludwig 
Kosegarten, who delivered his dramatic sermons on the shores of 
the Isle of Riigen in the Baltic, using the awesome and desolate 
coastal landscape as a metaphor for God. Kosegarten s pantheism 
was far from unique in Germany, and was in large part a product 
of the Sturm und Drang movement (see pages 787 and 803). Two 
leading members of the movement, Goethe and Johann Gottfried 
Herder (1744-1803), also played a major role in stimulating late 
eighteenth-century German nationalism, the political manifesta¬ 
tion of Romanticism, which is also reflected in Friedrich s paint¬ 
ing. In Origin of Language (1772), Herder argued that language 
was not divinely endowed but stemmed from the collective expe¬ 
rience of a people, triggering a search to define this experience. 
Herder, for example, collected an anthology of German folk 
songs, while the Grimm brothers did the same for folktales. This 
delving into the distant primitive past in search of ones roots was 
distinctly Romantic, for it created an emotional bond among 
people that in intensity was quite different from their former 
shared practical allegiance to an aristocracy. For his part, Goethe 
declared that Gothic architecture was native to Germany, and, 
unlike Classical buildings, was premised not on calculation but 
Romantic intuition, Gothic cathedrals rising up like the towering 
oak trees that make up the great northern forests. 


Friedrich s most salient motifs in Abbey are the Gothic ruin 
and barren oak trees, motifs he knew his audience would imme¬ 
diately recognize as national emblems. The picture was made at a 
moment of national crisis. There was no Germany in 1810, only a 
loose confederation of some 300 German-speaking states and free 
cities called the Holy Roman Empire, nominally ruled by 
Austrian emperors of the Habsburg dynasty. The emotional surge 
toward unification was crushed when Napoleon s troops over¬ 
whelmed the country. Friedrich s crumbling abbey and striped 
oaks are symbols of the demise of nationalism, while the winter 
chill, deadening silence, and gloomy light of a disappearing sun 
are a reflection of the national mood, and especially Friedrich s. 

America: Landscape as Metaphor 

Art had not been a priority in the struggling British colonies in 
America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the 
only art market that existed there was largely for portraiture. 
Sculpture was mostly limited to weather vanes and tombstones. 
This did not change dramatically in the Federalist period 
(1789-1801) and the opening decades of the nineteenth century, 
although the first academies and galleries were founded in the first 
quarter of the century—the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts 
(1802), the Boston Atheneum (1807), and New Yorks National 
Academy of Design (1825). By 1825, New York had surpassed 
Philadelphia as the largest and wealthiest city in the nation—in 
large part due to the opening of the 383-mile (613-km) Erie Canal 


832 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



that ran from Buffalo to the Hudson River at Albany, funneling 
the raw materials and produce of the hinterlands into New York 
City. New York simultaneously became the nation s art capital, 
and consequently our discussion of American art will center on 
New York well into the twentieth century 

In the 1820s, landscape painting began to acquire status and, 
by the 1840s, it had eclipsed portraiture as the most esteemed 
form of American art. A young nation with little history, the 
United States became preoccupied with a search for its own iden¬ 
tity, one that would distinguish it from its Old World roots. 
Literary figures such as William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) and 
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) identified the land itself as 
America s wealth and contrasted its unspoiled virginity to the 
densely populated, resource-impoverished lands of Europe. 
America was overflowing with natural resources, a veritable 
Garden of Eden. They also interpreted this pristine land as a man¬ 
ifestation of God, whose presence was to be seen in every blade of 
grass, ray of sun, and drop of water. To meditate on nature was to 
commune with God. This belief stemmed not only from the 
metaphysics of German philosophers—the same thought we saw 
expressed in Friedrich s paintings—but also from the American 
Transcendentalist movement, which surfaced in the 1830s and is 
perhaps best known today from such works as Emerson s Nature 
(1836) and Henry David Thoreau s Walden (1852). In this famous 
quote from Nature , Emerson expresses the spiritual unification 
with nature and the consequent role of the artist or writer to 
channel this unification into art: “Standing on the bare ground— 
my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space— 
all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am 


nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate 
through me; I am part or parcel of God.” Elsewhere, Emerson 
wrote: “The poet must be a rhapsodist—his inspiration a sort of 
bright casualty; his will in it only the surrender of will to the 
Universal Power.” The American landscape became the emblem 
of the young nation. 

THOMAS COLE AND THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL 

America s first art movement, based on landscape and born in the 
1820s, is called the Hudson River School, because the artists, most 
with studios in New York, were initially centered on the Hudson 
River Valley before fanning out through all of New England in 
the 1830s through the 1850s. Spring through fall, the artists trav¬ 
eled through New York and New England making studies, gener¬ 
ally drawings, of this unique land, which they then developed into 
large paintings in their New York studios during the winter. The 
lead figure in this group was Thomas Cole (1801-1848), a found¬ 
ing member of the National Academy of Design who produced 
his first major landscapes after an 1825 summer sketching trip up 
the Hudson. Initially, his views were sublime, presenting a wild, 
primordial nature, often with storms pummeling the forests, dark 
clouds blackening the earth, and lightning-blasted trees. Despite 
depicting specific sites, his style relied on European landscape 
conventions and formulas, with little attention given to detail. 

By the 1830s, however, Cole s paint handling became tighter 
and his pictures less formulaic and more specific, embracing a 
Romantic truth to nature that we saw in Constable. This is appar¬ 
ent in The Oxbow (fig. 24.9), made in 1836 for exhibition at the 
National Academy of Design. In this breathtaking view from atop

Mount Holyoke in western Massachusetts, Cole presents the nat¬ 
ural wonder of the American landscape. The foreground is sub¬ 
lime wilderness, with blasted and windswept trees and dark storm 
clouds dumping sheets of rain. Except for the representation of 
Cole next to his parasol looking up at us (and in effect declaring 
his preference for primordial nature), there is no sign of humans 
in the foreground. Far below in the sunlit valley, separated by 
distance, height, and the sharp contour of the mountain ridge, are 
the Connecticut River and its plain. Closer inspection reveals not 
just a natural plain but also cultivated fields and settlements. But 
they are in such harmony with nature that they seem to blend in. 
Here is the “Garden of Eden,” as Americans described their land, 
blessed by the divine light breaking through the clouds. Cole 
underscores Gods presence in the land by roughly etching, under 
the guise of cleared forest, the name “Noah” into the distant hill; 
upside down, these same letters become Hebrew letters for 
Shaddai , meaning “the Almighty. ” 

Cole’s settlers respect nature as well as its cycles, fitting right 
in. In the wilderness foreground, the dead trees and seedlings 
represent this cycle of life, death, and resurrection. First and fore¬ 
most, the picture is a paean to the glory of the American land. 
Cole captures the immense scale of the American landscape and 
its many moods, from the wild sublimity of the foreground, to the 
pastoral tranquility of the valley, to the majestic vastness of the 
distant hills. In The Oxbow , we see the artist rhapsodizing in 
Romantic fashion as Emerson prescribed, bonding with nature 
and God. 

The Oxbow was also a political painting, as viewers at the 
1836 exhibition would have recognized. While most Hudson 
River School painters depicted the glory of God as manifested in 
the American land, a handful, following Cole’s lead, also used 
landscape painting to comment on the economic and social issues 
consuming the nation. An 1829-32 trip to Europe gave Cole 
first-hand knowledge of Turner’s paintings and reinforced Cole’s 
interest in using landscape as a vehicle for themes of historical sig¬ 
nificance. In 1836, for example, Cole painted a five-picture series 
titled The Course of Empire, which traced the transformation of 
the same site from a primitive state, to an agrarian society, to a 
thriving empire, to a decadent empire, and lastly to a state of ruin. 
Just as Turner’s landscapes were metaphors for social and political 
issues, so were Coles. His audience would recognize in The 
Course of Empire a statement reflecting the heated debate about 
progress then consuming the country. On one side were those 
Americans arguing for a Jeffersonian agrarian America; on the 
other were the advocates of Jacksonian laissez-faire economics, 
which embraced unrestricted industrial, commercial, and financial 
development. Cole, who like the novelist James Fenimore Cooper 
(1789-1851) was an early environmentalist, found the rapid 
destruction of the wilderness and disrespect for the land disheart¬ 
ening. His vision of healthy development stopped at the 
Jeffersonian agrarian society, where Americans lived in harmony 
with the land. He equated Jacksonian politics with empire, which 
would result not only in the destruction of the land but also the 
eventual downfall of America. In The Oxbow , Cole proclaims his 


own personal preference for the wilderness, while championing 
the virtue of an agrarian civilization, one where Americans respect 
their covenant with God. 

FREDERIC CHURCH AND NATIONAL LANDSCAPE Coles 
only student, Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900), fully 
understood how landscape could be used to make powerful 
political statements. Born into a wealthy family in Hartford, 
Connecticut, he joined Cole at his summer home in Catskill, 
New York, on the Hudson in 1844. In 1848, the year Cole died, 
he was made a member of the National Academy and was living 
in New York City. By 1850, Church had inherited Cole’s mantle 
as America’s foremost landscape painter, largely making pastoral 
or rural scenes showing man harmoniously living in nature. But 
throughout the 1850s, Church’s work became increasingly sub¬ 
lime. He traveled to Niagara Falls to capture the awesome scale, 
power, and deafening roar of this famous landmark. His search 
for the sublime even took him to locales outside the United 
States, first going to the Andes in Ecuador and Columbia in 1853 
to paint the exotic trappings of the tropics, and then sailing to the 
Arctic in 1859 to portray foreboding icebergs in Newfoundland 
and Labrador. 

By January 1860, Church had begun working on Twilight in 
the Wilderness (fig. 24.10), which he finished that year, exhibiting 
it to wild acclaim, first in the Tenth Street Studio Building, where 
he had a studio, and then at the Goupil Gallery in New York. 
While working on this painting, he was also finishing up The 
Heart of the Andes , the result of a second trip to South America in 
1857, and starting Icebergs , his first major iceberg painting. 
Twilight represents the wonders of the American wilderness, most 
viewers associating it with Maine and New Hampshire. The pic¬ 
ture represents a temperate environment and nicely complements 
the tropical and Arctic themes of the other two works in Church’s 
studio at the time, the trilogy in effect presenting a compendium 
of New World climates as described by the German explorer and 
naturalist Alexander von Humboldt in his five-volume book 
Cosmos (1845). 

As its title suggests, the picture represents the American 
wilderness, a pure, unspoiled Garden of Eden, with no sign of 
human presence. Americans considered brilliantly colored sun¬ 
sets unique to their country, thus an emblem of the nation, just as 
they did the spectacular autumnal foliage, which was especially 
popular with painters. But Church’s use here of twilight probably 
has a second function, that of referring to the twilight of the 
wilderness as New England especially was being settled and 
crisscrossed with railroad tracks, and pioneers, driven by 
Manifest Destiny (the compulsion to settle the entire continent), 
were swarming west toward the Pacific. And twilight has a third 
function in the image. We must remember the painting was made 
in 1860, a year before the Civil War, which most everyone knew 
was looming on the horizon as the slavery issue violently divided 
the nation. Church makes the country the focus of his picture by 
putting an American eagle on top of the dead tree in the left fore¬ 
ground, the tree serving as a pole for the American flag of fiery

horizon, Church casts doubts on the future of both the wilderness

France: Neoclassical Romanticism 

Neoclassicism dominated French art in the late eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries. This was because of Jacques-Louis 
Davids powerful impact on painting (see pages 813-16). In his 
lifetime, David had some 400 students, and after 1800 his most 
gifted followers from the 1790s began to rival him for public 
attention. David convinced the new Republican government to 
abolish the French Royal Academy, although the biennial Louvre 
Salon exhibitions were still held during the Directory (1794-1799) 
and the Napoleonic era (1799-1814) and remained critical for an 
artist s success. David himself received major commissions from 
Napoleon, and was the emperors official court painter. With 
Napoleon s defeat at Waterloo, David exiled himself to Brussels. 
But by then he had long been superseded by his students and 
followers. Despite the Neoclassical look of their paintings, these 
works were made in the Romantic era, and thematically we can 
describe them as belonging not to Neoclassicism but to 
Neoclassical Romanticism. 


AN N E -LOU IS CIRODET AND THE PRIMITIVES Anne- 
Louis Girodet (1767-1824), one of Davids most brilliant pupils, 
introduced a new type of Neoclassical painting in 1791 when he 
sent The SleepofEndymion (fig. 24.11) back to Paris from Rome, 
where he was a pensioner at the French Academy, having won 
the Rome Prize. The painting was shown at the Salon of 1793 to 
universal praise. Rome Prize students were required to execute an 
oil painting of a nude. Girodet’s figure conforms to the 
Neoclassical paradigm: It is a Classical nude with sharp contours 
and is carefully painted with tight brushwork. Rather than virile 
and virtuous, however, Girodet s nude is androgynous and sensu¬ 
ous. The choice of subject was also startling. Derived from 
Classical mythology, its theme was an indulgent hedonism at a 
time when everyone else was portraying noble sacrifice, as in 
David s The Oath of the Horatii (see fig. 23.27). Girodet presents 
the story of the moon-goddess Selene (Diana), who fell desper¬ 
ately in love with the mortal shepherd Endymion and put him 
into an eternal sleep so she could visit him every night. Fiere, we 
see one of these nocturnal visits, with Zephyr pulling back the 
branches of a tree so that Selene can seduce the sleeping shepherd. 
David s harsh, raking light gives way to a softer, more sensual illu¬ 
mination that gently caresses Endymion, creating a chiaroscuro 
that emphasizes the slow undulation of his soft, beautiful flesh.

Moonbeams dramatically backlight the figures, etching strong, 
elegant curvilinear contours. 

Despite the erotic content, this is hardly a titillatingly playful 
Rococo picture, for the work has a powerful mood of primal 
sensuality, brought about in part by the mysterious moonlight. 
Combining Correggio s chiaroscuro and vaporous sfumato (see 
fig. 17.26) with the grace of Bronzino s contours (see fig. 17.11), 
two artists Girodet studied first hand in Rome, the painter created 
a picture that does not illustrate a story so much as it projects a 
state of mind characterized by powerful elemental urges, a qual¬ 
ity that is distinctly Romantic. 

In the late 1790s, a number of Davids followers, who called 
themselves the Primitives, took their cue from Girodet s 
Endymion. Themes of sensuous love based on Classical myth, 
such as Cupid and Psyche and the death of Hyacinth in the arms 
of Apollo, became popular. Figures were backlit to highlight 
strong contours and create a sensuous undulating line. 
Reinforcing this taste for prominent outlines was the publication 
of John Flaxman s engraved illustrations of Homers The Iliad and 
The Odyssey , made in Rome in 1792-93 and based on Greek vase 
painting. (See Materials and Techniques , page 792.) Flaxman s star¬ 
tlingly severe engravings, in which he reduced figures and objects 
to a simple line with no shading or modeling, were popular 
throughout Europe and exerted a tremendous influence over the 
style and motifs of art during the Romantic era. While the 
Primitives in David s studio were heavily influenced by Flaxman 
and Girodet, they also admired the stripped-down clarity of 
Greek vase painting and the simple forms of fifteenth-century 


Italian painting, then considered “primitive” compared with the 
High Renaissance, hence the group s name. 

JEAN-AUGUSTE-DOMINIQUE INGRES The painter Jean- 
Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867) was briefly in the 
Primitives group, and a strong emphasis on contour and line 
became one of the hallmarks of his Neoclassical style. He entered 
David s studio in 1797 and won the Rome Prize in 1801, although 
in part because of the Napoleonic Wars he could not take advan¬ 
tage of his award until 1806. Before leaving for Italy, he received 
a commission from the French Legislative Assembly for a Portrait 
of Napoleon on His Imperial Throne (fig. 24.12), which he showed 
at the Salon of 1806, where it was heavily criticized, even by 
Napoleon. Ingres s Neoclassical roots are evident in the harsh 
Davidian planarity, compressed space, and emphasis on line or 
contour, although Ingres s edge is sharper, more lively, almost 
seeming to have a life of its own, as, for example, in the white 
border of Napoleon s robe. 

But here the comparison with David and the Primitives 
stops and Ingres s Romanticism begins, although it does not over¬ 
whelm his Neoclassicism: He would be recognized as the great 
standard-bearer of the latter style in the first half of the nineteenth 
century. Ingres fills every square inch of his portrait of Napoleon 
with opulence—gold, gems, ermine, marble, tapestries, rare 
objects. In one hand Napoleon holds the golden scepter of 
Charlemagne, in the other the ivory hand of justice of the French 
medieval kings, both certifying his royal legacy. The elaborate 
gilt throne looks as if it is from imperial Rome. Its curved back

forms a halo around the emperor’s head, which contemporaries 
recognized as a reference to God the Father in the central panel 
of Jan and Hubert van Eycks Ghent Altarpiece (see fig. 14.10), 
then installed in the Napoleon Museum in the Louvre and part 
of the immense booty of Napoleons conquests. Ingres even 
has Napoleon strike the same pose as the Van Eycks’ God, 
which when combined with his iconic frontal position suggests 
that Napoleon is endowed with the same qualities, or at least that 
his actions are sanctioned by God. Ingress deification of 
Napoleon is also strengthened by a resemblance to Zeus in a 
Flaxman line engraving. 

Ingres’s frozen larger-than-life image presents Napoleon as 
imperial, aloof, and divine, and its wondrously exotic and even 
fantastical Romantic content must have fascinated, even awed, the 


audience at the Salon of 1806. While preferring tight brushwork 
and a hard icy surface to painterly gesture, Ingres was clearly a 
magnificent colorist. In Napoleon , his hues match the objects in 
opulence and have the same gemlike quality he found in the 
sparkling oils of the Van Eycks’ paintings. They have a similar 
level of realism in capturing various lush textures. Ingres was 
as concerned with harmonizing complex relationships of deeply 
saturated color as he was in balancing the intricate designs of 
his compositions. 

In Italy, Ingres studied ancient art and fell in love with the 
Classicism of Raphael. But as a Romantic—which is what he 
considered himself to be—his interests were broad, even exotic, 
and led him to medieval, Byzantine, and Early Renaissance art. 
After his four-year stipend expired, Ingres stayed on in Italy at his 
own expense for an additional 14 years, often impoverished and, 
like a true Romantic artist, painting what he wanted, not what the 
academy dictated. Periodically, he sent pictures back to Paris for 
exhibition, where they were generally met with derision. An 
example is Grande Odalisque (fig. 24.13), commissioned in 1814 
by Caroline Murat, Napoleon’s sister and the queen of Naples, 
and submitted to the Salon of 1819. 

This painting is even more exotic than his portrait of 
Napoleon, for it represents a Turkish concubine and is one of the 
earliest examples of Orientalism, as the Western fascination with 
the culture of the Muslim world of North Africa and the Near 
East was then called. (Byron’s Romantic poem The Corsair , also 
featuring a harem slave, was published the same year the painting 
was commissioned.) This fascination was, in part, sparked by 
Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt in 1798-99 and by the detailed 
description of the region and its culture and customs in the 
24-volume government-sponsored publication Description de 
VEgypte , which appeared from 1809 to 1822. Orientalism reflects 
European imperialism and its accompanying sense of superiority 
that viewed non-Christian Arab culture as not only different and 
exotic but also inferior—backward, immoral, violent, and bar¬ 
baric. Here, the exotic subject gave Ingres license to paint a female 
nude who was not a Greek goddess, although she recalls numer¬ 
ous Renaissance and Baroque paintings of a reclining Venus and 
sculptures of Ariadne from antiquity. To make his figure more 
appealing to a Paris audience, Ingres gave his odalisque European 
features, even a Raphaelesque face and coiffure. Although the 
figure is alluringly sensual, and the hashish pipe, incense burner, 
fan, and turban “authenticate” the exotic scene, the painting as a 
whole projects a soothing sense of cultivated beauty, refinement, 
and idealization that seems Classical. In other words, Ingres 
treats a Romantic subject in an essentially Neoclassical manner, 
including idealization. 

Ingres’s trademark is a beautiful Classical line, which we can 
see as he focuses on the odalisque’s flesh. Bathed in a caressing 
chiaroscuro, the body gently swells and recedes with delectable 
elegance. Its contours languidly undulate with sensuality, the 
sharply defined edges and tan color contrasting with the objects 
around it. The opulent color of the objects and the lush fabrics 
and peacock feathers enhance the sensual aura of the picture.

Salon viewers noted the concubine s back had too many verte¬ 
brae, and certainly her elbowless right arm is too long; but as far 
as Ingres was concerned, the sweeping curves of both were essen¬ 
tial components of the graceful composition, the line of the right 
arm even being continued into the folds of the drapery. 

In 1821, Ingres received a commission to make an enormous 
painting of The Vow of Louis XIII for the cathedral in Montauban 
in his hometown. Penniless, otherwise forgotten, and living in 
Florence, with this painting Ingres turned his life around. He 
showed the picture at the Salon of 1824 to rave reviews and was 
hailed as the great savior of the Classical tradition. With the 
final fall of Napoleon in 1815, David, who had been named 
painter to the emperor in 1801, skulked off to Brussels, and the 
careers of all of his students had stalled at the same time, displaced 
by a new generation of painterly Romantic artists. Almost by 
default, Ingres, because of The Vow of Louis XIII, was now 
crowned the protector of Classicism, the champion of line over 
color, and the savior of the “wholesome traditions of great art” 
and ideal beauty from the unfettered emotionalism of the 
painterly Romantics. In 1825, he was elected to the French 
Academy, which as a Romantic he had disdained, and soon 
became its director. He was also awarded the Legion of Honor, 
the highest award in France for service to the state, established by 
Napoleon in 1802. His studio became the destination of choice 
for aspiring young history painters. 

While Ingres defined himself as a history painter, since it 
held the greatest prestige within the academy, his strength was 


portraiture, especially of women. His 1856 Portrait of Madame 
Ines Moitessier (fig. 24.14) is a good example. The work was com¬ 
missioned in 1844, and over the next 12 years the guardian of ideal 
beauty transformed the wife of a wealthy banker into an image of 
Classical perfection, an earthly goddess. He gave her creamy 
smooth skin, beautiful curvilinear shoulders, arms, and hands, 
and a Raphaelesque face. He enriched her with a lavish rose-pat¬ 
terned gown lined with a fashionable fringe, opulent Renaissance- 
revival jewelry on the raised right arm and cabochon garnets sur¬ 
rounded with diamonds on the left, and a peacock-feather fan. 
Behind her is Chinese vase, a fanlike shield to protect her from 
fireplace heat in the winter, and an imposing gilt-frame mirror. 
Also contributing to her perfection are the immaculately smooth 
paint surface (free of painterly brushwork), the precise drawing, 
and the harmonious blending of a complicated composition with 
a richly colored palette. 

Madame Moitessier s pose suggests various Classical proto¬ 
types, while her contemplative hand-to-head gesture derives 
from Roman murals at Herculaneum. The profile in the mirror, 
an obvious distortion, could not be more Greek. It also super¬ 
imposes an eerie psychological veil on the work, reinforcing the 
introspection of her gesture and tinting the painting with a 
mysterious mood that converts the realistic materiality of 
Moitessier s physical surroundings into a spiritual embodiment 
of beauty. While the style is distinctly Neoclassical, this 
mysterious mood and the intensely lush setting give the picture 
Romantic overtones.

France: Painterly Romanticism 
and Romantic Landscape 

While Ingres was taking Neoclassicism deep into the nineteenth 
century, but now within the context of Romanticism, Antoine- 
Jean Gros, a second student of David s, opened up an alternative 
course, one that would abandon line, order, clear rational space, 
evenly diffused light, ideal beauty, and Classical repose for bold 
brushstrokes, dazzling color, impetuous drama, confused space, 
irrational lighting, and extreme emotions. In his wake came 
Theodore Gericault and Eugene Delacroix, who brought 
painterly Romanticism to the fore in the 1820s, resulting in 
contemporaries finally applying the word Romanticism, previ¬ 
ously reserved for literature and music, to art. In the 1820s as well, 
landscape painting began to emerge from under the shadow cast 
by Neoclassicism. French Romantic landscape was never as apoc¬ 
alyptic as its British counterpart nor as pantheistic as in Germany 
and America. Instead it was more serene and poetic. 

ANTOINE-JEAN GROS Gros (1771-1835) entered David’s stu¬ 
dio in 1785. During the turmoil of the French Revolution, David 


was able to secure a pass for Gros to go to Rome, although by the 
time he arrived there the city was closed to the antipapist French. 
Through Napoleon s wife, Josephine, he met Napoleon in Milan, 
traveled with his army, and impressed the general with his art. 
Napoleon charged Gros with painting his battles and glorifying 
his campaigns. Bonaparte, who was as brilliant at propaganda as 
he was at military strategy, carefully controlled his public image 
and relied heavily on art to reinforce his political position. He 
made sure his commissions were shown at the Salons, where they 
would be seen by everyone and reported in the press, which was 
becoming more important in the opening decades of the century 
due to increased literacy and decreased paper and printing costs. 

The Napoleonic era was a catalyst for French Romanticism. 
The drama, glory, valor, and adventures of the Napoleonic Wars 
provided endless material for the artistic imagination. The North 
African campaigns took Europeans into the forbidden Arab 
world and introduced them to a wondrous exotic subject matter 
that they brought back to Europeans anxious for new experi¬ 
ences. Gros s first commission, Napoleon in the Pesthouse at Jaffa, 
March 11,1799 (fig. 24.15), came in 1804 and was exhibited in that 
years Salon to huge success. This 23-foot-wide picture was

commissioned not only to promote the emperor s bravery and 
leadership but to reinforce his humanitarian image, which was 
propagandistically essential considering the enormous human loss 
tallied in many of his battles, especially in Jaffa (then in Palestine 
but today a section of Tel Aviv, Israel). During the campaign, the 
bubonic plague broke out among the French ranks. Legend has it 
that, to calm his troops, Napoleon fearlessly entered the pest- 
house and walked among the patients. Here we see the general, 
like Christ healing the sick, courageously touching the open sore 
of a victim, his presence virtually willing the dying to rise. The 
painting ignores the fact that Napoleon poisoned these same sick 
troops when he retreated from Jaffa. 

While Gros s drawing and brushwork are relatively tight and 
Davidian, the picture is one of overt, turbulent drama, created 
by the dark shadows, bursts of light, splashes of bright red, 
rapidly receding perspective of the arcades, and cloud-filled sky. 
Chaos prevails. Although Napoleon is placed in the center as a 
compositional anchor, he momentarily gets lost in the turmoil of 
the scene. Our eye goes to the circle of the dead, dying, and sick 
surrounding him, which includes the Michelangelesque figures in 
the foreground shadows and the “resurrected” nudes next to 
Bonaparte. The male nude is now neither heroic, as in David, nor 
lovely, as in Girodet, but helpless and horrifying. Napoleons 
courageous act has to vie for a viewer s attention with the dark 
mood of psychological and physical suffering and the exoticism, 
to Western eyes, of the Arab attendants and Islamic architecture. 
(This picture helped launch the vogue for Oriental subjects that 
we saw in Ingres s Grande Odalisque.) The monumental arches 
compositionally may pay homage to David s The Oath of the 
Horatii (fig. 23.27), but instead of supporting a narrative of 
Neoclassical stoicism and clarity they contribute a Romantic 
exoticism and sense of foreboding of horrifying uncertainty. 

THEODORE GERICAULT Without the Napoleonic campaigns 
to feed his imagination, Gros s career soon waned. David s other 
outstanding students and followers, such as Girodet, were simul¬ 
taneously eclipsed. The future was now represented by Theodore 
Gericault (1791-1824) and those who followed him. Gericault 
was independently wealthy and largely self-taught, frequenting 
the Napoleon Museum, where he copied the great colorists: 
Rubens, Van Dyck, and Titian. Gros, however, was his role 
model, and Gros and Rubens were clearly the artistic sources for 
Gericault s submission to the Salon of 1812, Charging Chasseur 
(fig. 24.16). The energetic brushwork, the sharp diagonal reces¬ 
sion of the horse, the bold contrast of light and dark, the rippling 
contours on the horse s right legs, and the flashes of color could 
not be further from David or closer to Rubens. Completely gone 
is the Davidian planarity that structured the turmoil of Gros s 
pesthouse. Made during Napoleon s Russian campaign, the pic¬ 
ture functions as an emblem of heroic valor. It is not meant to rep¬ 
resent a specific event or person. Instead, the twisting chasseur 
(cavalryman) and rearing horse embody the psychological and 
physical forces that consume combatants in the heat of battle, and 
it is interesting how many compositional parallels there are 



24.1 6 Theodore Gericault, Charging Chasseur. 1812. Oil on canvas,

between rider and horse, suggesting the sheer animalistic forces 
driving the cavalryman s heroism. This is a picture of raw emotion 
and physical tension, devoid of Neoclassical reason and the rules 
of beauty and morality. As the great Romantic writer Stendhal 
(pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle, 1783-1842) said in his review 
of the 1824 Salon, “The school of David can only paint bodies; it 
is decidedly inept at painting souls. ” 

Charging Chasseur revealed Gericault s lack of formal train¬ 
ing; namely, his inability to draw as seen in the oddly twisted head 
of the cavalryman, for example. Continuing his independent 
study, he now worked from Classical models, copying High 
Renaissance painters at the Royal Museum, as the Louvre was 
called after the second fall of Napoleon in 1815 and with the 
establishment of Louis XVIIIs Restoration monarchy. In 1816, 
he went to Italy, stopping in Florence to draw Michelangelo s 
Medici tombs (see fig. 17.5), before going to Rome to study 
the antiquities. Not long after his return to Paris in late 1817, 
he began thinking about the third and last painting he would 
exhibit at the Salons, The Rafi of the Medusa (fig. 24.17), painted 
between 1818 and 1819 after many studies. In 1816, the Medusa , 
a government vessel, foundered off the West African coast with 
approximately 400 people aboard. The captain commandeered the

24.1 7 Theodore Gericault, The Rafi of the Medusa. 1818-19. Oil on canvas, 16'1" x 23'6" (4.9 x 7.16 cm). Musee du Louvre, Paris 


six lifeboats for government officials and officers, with the 
remaining 150 passengers being consigned to a makeshift raft 
that was set adrift by the crew at the mercy of the sea. When 
the passengers were finally rescued some two weeks later, only a 
handful were still alive. The callous captain was incompetent, 
an aristocrat who had been appointed for political reasons by the 
government of Louis XVIII. The headline-making event was 
condemned in the press as a reflection of the corruption of Louis s 
administration. 

Gericault decided to paint the moment when the survivors 
first sighted a ship, not the more politically charged moment 
when the captain set the raft adrift. The painting is thus about the 
harrowing mental and physical experience of survival rather than 
an accusation of injustice. Gericault seems to have latched onto 
his subject after revisiting Gros s Napoleon in the Pesthouse , for 
the foreground is littered with Michelangelesque nudes. From the 
bodies of the dead and dying in the foreground, the composition 
recedes in a dramatic Baroque diagonal (see fig. 20.1), climaxing in 
the group supporting the frantically waving black man. As our 
eye follows this line of writhing, twisting bodies, we move 
from death to hope. But this is not a painting that is at root about 
hope, for there are no heroes, no exemplary moral fortitude. 


Rather the theme is the human species against nature, and 
Gericault s goal was to make a viewer feel the trials and tribula¬ 
tions of the castaways. The academic, Classically proportioned 
monumental figures are a catalogue of human misery, reflecting 
the death, cannibalism, fighting, insanity, sickness, exhaustion, 
hunger, and thirst that tormented the victims. The stark realism, 
obtained in part through tighter brushwork, heightens our vis¬ 
ceral connection to the dramatically lit event; we too are on the 
crude raft, pitched about on the high seas, and aimlessly buffeted 
by the wind. 

Gericault would never exhibit again in a Salon and within six 
years would be dead at the age of 32. His later work, unlike The 
Raft , was not monumental; nor does it show off the artist s abil¬ 
ity to draw and incorporate Classical models into an otherwise 
Baroque composition with a Romantic mood. Rather, it was 
largely painterly, a commitment reinforced by a trip to London in 
1820 where he saw the work of Constable and Turner. His tech¬ 
nique is apparent in a remarkable series of ten portraits of insane 
men and women made during the winter of 1822-23, his last 
active months. Only five exist today, and they belonged to a 
physician named Georget, who specialized in psychiatry, leading 
scholars to think he may have commissioned the paintings for

documentary purposes. Gericault’s contemporaries, following 
Caspar Lavater’s theories (see page 803), believed there was a cor¬ 
relation between mental health and physiognomy, and that men¬ 
tal illness could be diagnosed by reading facial features. Having 
no need of money, Gericault obviously undertook the work for 
personal interest, and in addition to this series also painted guil¬ 
lotined heads and hospital inmates. The series allowed him to 
explore the mind and human suffering, as seen in Portrait of an 
Insane Man (Man Suffering from Delusions of Military Rank) (fig. 
24.18). Using energetic brushwork that seems virtually to signify 
mental energy, he exposes the psychotic derangement plaguing his 
subject, including nervousness, fear, and a sternness that implies a 
delusion of importance. The presentation is sympathetic, reflect¬ 
ing the period’s recognition of mental illness as a disease, but it 
does not undermine the powerful mood of alienation and irra¬ 
tionality that consumes the sitter. In contrast to the goddesslike 
perfection and poise of Ingres’s Portrait of Madame Ines 
Moitessier , Gericault’s insane man is an emblem of imperfection, 
embodying a range of human psychoses and foibles—a reflection 
of the Romantic interest in the psychological and physical suffer¬ 
ing of the socially marginalized.

EUGENE DELACROIX In 1822, Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863) 
emerged as the standard-bearer of painterly Romanticism, the 
position Gericault so dearly coveted. Delacroix was seven years 
younger than Gericault and came from a similar background— 
Parisian and wealthy. Like Gericault, he was essentially independ¬ 
ent and self-taught, studying the great masterpieces at the Louvre, 
especially Rubens, Titian, and Veronese. His greatest excitement 
came when visiting the studios of Gros and Gericault. He 
befriended the latter in 1818 and posed for one of the figures in 
The Rafe of the Medusa. His submission to the Salon of 1824, 
Scenes from the Massacre at Chios (fig. 24.19), presents a com¬ 
pendium of misery and suffering in the foreground and was obvi¬ 
ously inspired by the groupings of the dead and dying in Gross 
Pesthouse at Jaffa and Gericault’s The Rafe of the Medusa. The pic¬ 
ture was inspired by the Greek war of independence. In 1820, the 
Greeks revolted against the ruling Ottoman Empire, and the 
following year the Turks raided the Greek island of Chios, 
destroying villages and either massacring or enslaving virtually 
the entire population of 20,000. Delacroix’s painting was based 
upon this event and was in part made to show support for Greek 
independence as well as to express the Romantic passion for 
democracy and individual freedom. 

In the middle- and background, Delacroix presents burning 
and slaying transpiring in a blur of smoke and confusion, while in 
the foreground, he presents a group of Greeks rounded up for 
execution or enslavement, a scene that is, by contrast, remarkably 
devoid of violence. Resignation, desperation at the impending loss 
of loved ones, and hopelessness reign, this pessimism being sym¬ 
bolized by the foreboding silhouette of the armed Ottoman 
guard. Delacroix reinforces the turmoil of the brutality in the 
background by the twisting and turning of the foreground figures 
and their undulating contours as well as by the chaotic piling up 
of bodies. The intense colors of the painting have darkened 
considerably over time, especially the blues and reds, which orig¬ 
inally created an optical snap that was reinforced by the bravura 
of the brushwork and sharp value contrasts. Clearly, Rubens is 
behind these qualities as well as the two asymmetrical composi¬ 
tional pyramids organizing the foreground group and the diago¬ 
nal recession into deep space. (Delacroix, however, subverts the 
traditional device of putting a hero at the apex of the pyramids by 
instead placing villains, the Turkish guards, there.) Delacroix was 
also influenced by the color and brushwork of Constable, who 
had three landscapes, including The Haywain (see fig. 24.5), in the 
same Salon. Upon seeing these, Delacroix repainted the sky at the 
last minute, giving it a brilliant luminosity, and he worked vivid 
colors into the garments. 

This “terrifying hymn in honor of doom and irremediable suf¬ 
fering,” as the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) 
described the painting, established Delacroix as the great 
Romantic painter. It was the first time the term “Romantic” had 
been applied to a visual artist, making him the artistic equivalent 
of composer Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) and writer Victor Hugo 
(1802-1885). And certainly Delacroix shared their Romantic 
spirit. (See Primary Source, page 845.) The year 1824 was therefore

Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863) 

From His Journal 

Delacroix began his Journal in 1822 and maintained it irregularly until 
his death in 1863. He wrote it, he said, “for myself alone” in the hope 
that it would “do me a lot of good. ” This excerpt is from an entry for 
May 14,1824. 


W hat torments my soul is its loneliness. The more it expands 
among friends and the daily habits or pleasure, the more, it 
seems to me, it flees me and retires into its fortress. The poet who 
lives in solitude, but who produces much, is the one who enjoys those 
treasures we bear in our bosom, but which forsake us when we give 
ourselves to others. When one yields completely to one’s soul, it 
opens itself completely. ... 

Novelty is in the mind that creates, and not in nature, the thing 
painted.

a critical one. It was the year Gericault died, Constable was intro¬ 
duced in Paris, and Ingres returned from Italy, unaware that he 
would be anointed the guardian of the Classical tradition. 

In 1825, Delacroix went to England, like Gericault before him, 
reinforcing his appreciation of British landscape and literature, 
especially the plays of Shakespeare, the poetry of Lord Byron 
(1788-1824), and the novels of Walter Scott (1771-1832). 


Delacroix would turn to their imagery, and to that of Dante 
and Goethe, to fire his imagination and cultivate his moods. 
One product of his reading was the 1827 painting Death 
of Sardanapalus (fig. 24.20), based on Byrons 1821 unrhymed 
poem Sardanapalus. Sardanapalus, the last Assyrian king, was 
overthrown by rebels because of his licentiousness and apathy. 
Too lethargic either to fight or to flee, he committed suicide.

Immersing himself in the king s mind as developed by Byron, 
Delacroix invented the scene of his death: He commands his 
eunuchs to bring to his bed, which is on a pyre, all of his prized 
possessions, including wives, pages, horse, and dog. The 


Rubenesque traits we identified in the foreground of Massacre at 
Chios are intensified in this claustrophobic, chaotic composition. 
The only unifying element is the red bed, the perspective of which 
is so skewed it acts as a funnel, channeling all of the writhing 


846 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 









energy and jumble of precious and exotic opulence to the anchor 
of the composition, the inert, indifferent king. He is the epitome 
of ennui and impotence. As in Massacre at Chios , Delacroix 
ignores Classical space and volume, allowing undulating con¬ 
tours, riotous color, and compositional pandemonium to project 
simultaneously the disparate moods of destruction, fear, violence, 
power, despair, sensuality, and indifference. With this enormous 
canvas of wanton annihilation, Delacroix offended just about 
everybody at the Salon of 1827, for in it there was nothing left of 
David s Classical formula, and there was no redeeming moral, just 
fascinating horror. 

Delacroix s style underwent a change in the 1830s after a trip 
to North Africa; his palette became brighter and his paint 
handling looser. In 1832-33, Delacroix was asked to visually doc¬ 
ument the due de Mornay s diplomatic mission to Morocco, and 
he excitedly made hundreds of watercolors that provided him 
with wondrous Oriental themes for the rest of his life. In 
Morocco, Delacroix entered a world of exotic architecture, cloth¬ 
ing, and landscape, of intense light, and of unimaginably bright 
colors in fabrics, tiles, and interior design that displayed a horror 
vacui rivaling his own. That his palette became more colorful can 
be seen in Women of Algiers (fig. 24.21), painted in Paris in 1834 
from studies. To enter the secluded world of a harem, Delacroix 
had to obtain special permission, and the mood of the painting 
captures the sultry, cloistered feeling of this sensual den. We can 
almost smell the aroma of incense, the fragrance of flowers, and 
the smoke from the hookah. Delacroix s hues are as sensual as his 
subject. Color is dappled, and contours are often not continuous 
or drawn but just materialize through the buildup of adjacent 
marks (fig. 24.22). A sea of paint and color covering the entire 
surface dissolves Neoclassical planarity and space. This technique 
began to free paint from what it was supposed to represent and 
established a platform for a new artistic style just over the 
horizon, Impressionism. 


Romantic Landscape Painting 

David s Neoclassicism was so dominant it even cast its shadow 
over French landscape painting in the opening decades of the 
nineteenth century, which was planar and stylized, largely 
modeled on Poussin and Claude Lorrain. The exhibition of 
Constables landscapes at the pivotal Salon of 1824 opened up 
new possibilities in the genre, and a younger generation impressed 
by the Englishman s powerful naturalism and Romantic moods 
made it the foundation of their work. By the following decades, 
they had established landscape as a viable genre in France, one 
that could rival history painting in popularity and paved the way 
for the rise of Impressionism in the 1860s. 

JEAN-BAP Tl STE -C AM ILLE COROT The first major nine¬ 
teenth-century French landscape painter was Jean-Baptiste- 
Camille Corot (1796-1875), who was already committed to a 
vision of landscape that had Romanticism s fidelity to nature when 
Constable s Haywain was exhibited at the Salon of 1824. Uninflu¬ 
enced by Constable, Corot s landscapes had Classical underpin¬ 
nings. In 1822, he studied with a Parisian Classical landscape 
painter, Victor Bertin, who taught him the rudiments of drawing 
and, more important, emphasized making small plein-air (“open- 
air”) studies called pochades, rapidly executed color studies in oil. 
In the studio, Bertin developed his sketches into large, formulaic 
Salon-oriented canvases. Corot rarely did, at least not initially; his 
small plein-air sketches often remained the final products until 
many years later, although he did not exhibit them either. When 
he later enlarged his pochades, he generally retained their accurate 
depictions of the land, refusing to idealize his scenes. 

In 1825, Corot went to Italy and produced his first major 
body of work, about 150 small paintings, most of famous sites. 
View of Rome (fig. 24.23), an oil on paper, is typical. Made on the 
spot in an hour or so, it is a literal, objective presentation of “the

truth of the moment,” as Constable would say. We are convinced 
we are looking at the Castel Sant’Angelo and St. Peter’s Basilica 
and real, not stylized clouds. We can feel the sun’s intense heat 
bouncing off the stone and see the clear late-afternoon light 
crisply delineating the buildings and bridge. Without idealizing 
his landscape, Corot displays an instinct for Classical clarity and 
stability that recalls Poussin and Claude. Strong verticals and 
horizontals anchor his composition to its surface of creamy 
brushwork, and his buildings, no matter how loosely painted and 
insignificant, have a monumental presence. Nature inspired Corot 
to create little poems of beautifully harmonized tones and colors, 
generally browns and greens, and a seamless integration of 
painterly brushwork and Classical grid. 

After a second trip to Italy in 1834, Corot made a concerted 
effort to attract attention at the Salons and added to his output 
large historical landscapes, such as Hagar in the Wilderness , which 
gained him occasional sales and some interest. But it was not until 


the late 1840s, when he developed his third category of picture, 
the lyrical landscape, that he became popular, financially success¬ 
ful, and famous. Corot was no longer inspired directly by nature, 
but by his memories of landscape and the Romantic moods it 
provoked, as in his Souvenir de Mortefontaine (Oise) (fig. 24.24), 
painted in 1864. We sense that Corot’s vision has been filtered 
through the haze of memory. The canvas is covered with thin, 
almost transparent brushstrokes, layered one over another, 
making everything somewhat indistinct, as if gently floating. A 
magical light pervades the scene, shimmering off the water, flick¬ 
ering through the trees, and prancing dotlike along the ground. 
Everything is light, ethereal, and insubstantial, like the reflections 
of the trees in the water, which seem to levitate. Corot gives us 
very little to look at in this idyllic scene, simply a rural woman 
who appears to be removing leaves from a tree while accompany¬ 
ing children pick flowers. Instead we look at the artist’s beautiful 
tonal palette that gracefully shifts from brown, to green, to gray,

to silver. We look at the powerful patterning of the trunks and 
branches of the foreground trees, and we delight in the magic of 
his gossamer brushwork. The picture is about creating a poetic 
mood, using abstract means to reinforce an idyllic vision that, 
while reminiscent of Claude Lorrain, reflects the Romantic yearn¬ 
ings of its author. 

THEODORE ROUSSEAU AND THE BARBIZON SCHOOL 

Unlike Corot, a group of academically trained painters called the 
Barbizon School took their aesthetic lead directly from 
Constable, augmenting his direct impressions of nature with a 
study of the great seventeenth-century Dutch landscapists, such 
as Ruisdael (see fig. 20.28), who were exhibited in the Louvre. The 
group emerged in the 1830s and got its name from the village of 
Barbizon, which bordered the forest of Fontainebleau, where the 
artists painted and many settled. (Corot, who had a house in 
nearby Ville d’Avray, also often painted there.) The forest had 
been a royal hunting preserve, and as a result it offered nature in 
a relatively unspoiled state, undisturbed by the Industrial 
Revolution smoldering just 40 miles (64 km) away in Paris. The 
best-known Barbizon painter is Theodore Rousseau (1812— 
1867). He learned the rudiments of painting from two aca¬ 
demically trained artists and by copying landscapes in the Louvre. 


In the early to mid-1830s, his work was occasionally accepted at 
the Salons, from which he was then banished from 1837 to 1848, 
his view of nature being deemed too unseemly. He led a rather 
bohemian existence and permanently settled in Barbizon in 1848. 

Under the Birches , Evening (fig. 24.25) of 1842-43 is a fine 
example of Rousseau s work, which is perhaps the most diverse of 
all of the Barbizon painters. Produced in the studio from studies 
made on a seven-month trip to the Berry region in central France, 
the painting, like those of Constable and Corot, avoids artificial 
compositional and stylized motifs and instead captures the 
essence of nature. We readily sense this is a specific site; each tree 
seems individualized, for example, and each wisp of cloud unique. 
We can feel the onset of twilight and the cool damp atmosphere of 
autumn. While the blue-green sky and brownish-orange foliage 
offer a touch of color, Rousseau s palette is somber and earthy, 
evoking soil, decaying plant and animal matter, and the interior 
gloom of a thicket. Like Constable s, Rousseaus brushwork is 
stippled, applied in small flecks that make the landscape pulse 
with energy, reinforced by the nervous outline of trees and 
bushes. We sense growth and the constant movement of nature. It 
is little wonder Rousseau was rejected at the Salons. His dark, 
honest pictures with their turgid brushwork must have been 
considered ugly and depressing by conservative taste.

CHAPTER 24 ART IN THE AGE OF ROMANTICISM, 1 789-1 848 849 




ROMANTIC SCULPTURE 

Compared with painting, sculpture was a severely limiting 
medium for an artist at the opening of the nineteenth century. In 
its most monumental form, free-standing historical sculpture, it 
was mostly restricted to the human figure, and since the 
Renaissance the sculpted figure had been largely based on antique 
models. Nineteenth-century sculptors throughout Europe would 
overwhelmingly follow the Classical paradigm of one or two fig¬ 
ures based on Greek and Roman prototypes and embodying 
some notion of virtue or beauty. In France, however, a dramatic 
change in the artistic climate toward 1830 allowed a small gap for 
experimentation. The rise of Delacroix and Romantic painting in 
the 1820s was followed by the new, more liberal constitutional 
monarchy of Louis-Philippe (the July Monarchy) that emerged 
after the 1830 revolution, which resulted from Charles X censor¬ 
ing newspapers and Parisians rising up en masse, forcing the king 
to abdicate. The bourgeoisie had more of a presence in the new 
government and in society in general, ushering in an era of mid¬ 
dle-class taste. These two forces gave a handful of artists the 
courage to create Romantic sculpture, which rejected the Classical 
model of beauty, morality, and perfection, and instead explored 
new subjects, emotions, and compositions. 

ANTOINE-LOUIS BARYE Antoine-Louis Barye (1796-1875) 
surprised his colleagues when he submitted a painted plaster of a 
tiger devouring a gavial (a species of crocodile) to the Salon of 
1831 (fig. 24.26), winning a gold medal. There was no tradition of 
animal sculpture at the Salons, and previously, in 1828, Barye had 
shown portrait busts. Barye, however, loved animals, and drew 
them at the zoo. He was also a friend of Delacroix, whose 
Romantic themes included animal hunts and fights, thus provid¬ 
ing Barye with a thematic vehicle for his interest in animal 
anatomy. Like Stubbs s Lion Attacking a Horse (see fig. 23.14), 
Tiger Devouring a Gavial of the Ganges is filled with Romantic 
terror, brute strength, and raw instinct unleashed without regard 


to morality, law, or decorum. It is a fierce fight to the death in the 
wilds of nature. Appealing to the Romantic imagination, Barye 
selected exotic animals, and often animals that traditionally do not 
prey on one another (tigers do not eat crocodiles). He also set his 
struggles in exotic locales, such as on the banks of the Ganges in 
India. His composition is filled with movement and a variety of 
shapes and textures, reinforcing the chaotic struggle and animal 
energy. In the 1840s, Barye began mass-producing his animals in 
bronze in a variety of sizes, successfully marketing them to a 
worldwide middle-class audience, including in America, and 
becoming quite famous. 

FRANCOIS RUDE Fame eluded Francois Rude (1784-1855), a 
sculptor who brought nationalistic fervor to his figurative work 
and is best remembered for the bas-relief often known as La 
Marseillaise (fig. 24.27) on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Rude 
enrolled in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 1809, studying sculpture; 
as a Napoleon sympathizer, he fled to Brussels when Bonaparte 
was defeated in 1815. He returned to Paris in 1827, and with a 
nationalistic zeal we associate with the Romantic era, he began 
studying French sculptural history—first the French Renaissance 
tradition of the School of Fontainebleau and Giovanni Bologna 
(see pages 601-03), and then delving deeper into the past to Claus 
Sluter (see pages 471-72). 

It was a perfect match, then, when in 1833 Rude received one 
of the four sculptural commissions for the Arc de Triomphe, since 
the works were about patriotic fervor. The arch had been left 
unfinished when Napoleon was exiled in 1815, and Louis- 
Philippe and his minister of the interior saw the monuments 
completion as an opportunity to demonstrate that the new 
government supported national reconciliation. Hence the sculp¬ 
tural program consisted of four works by different artists, each 
surrounding the arch opening and offering something to every 
segment of the French political spectrum. Rude received the 
assignment thanks to the success of a rather Neoclassical-looking 
sculpture of a nude Neapolitan fisherboy playing with a turtle

that he had submitted to the Salon of 1833. The Salon submission 
hardly anticipated the chaotic explosion we see in The Departure 
of the Volunteers of1792, the formal title for La Marseillaise. 

The scene honors the volunteers who rallied to defend the 
new French Republic from an Austro-Prussian threat in 1792. A 
winged allegorical figure representing both France and Liberty 
leads a collection of soldiers from different periods of the nation’s 
past. Rather than a specific event, Rude evokes an eternal, all- 
powerful nationalistic spirit that emanates from the people and 
arises when called upon. While the figures have a Classical 
anatomy, strike Classical poses, and are aligned parallel to the wall 
in shallow relief, the composition is frenetic, a whirligig of arms, 
legs, and twisted bodies that energize the outpouring of patriot¬ 
ism that is swept along by Liberty above. This claustrophobic 
jumble of figures brings to mind Delacroix’s turbulent pile of 
victims and objects in his Death of Sardanapalus (see fig. 24.20). 
When unveiled in 1836, The Departure was unanimously hailed 


the best of the four works on the Arc de Triomphe and was nick¬ 
named La Marseillaise after the French national anthem, because it 
so successfully embodied the national spirit. Rude himself 
attained no lasting fame from the project, and without commis¬ 
sions, which sculptors, unlike painters, rely on, he had no oppor¬ 
tunity to develop further the innovative aesthetic implications of 
The Departure. 

ROMANTIC REVIVALS IN 
ARCHITECTURE 

The social and political turmoil that rocked Europe from 1789 to 
1848 resulted in a search for stability and comfort, which in archi¬ 
tecture came in the form of revival styles. Instead of developing 
new forms, architects resurrected the past, its familiarity provid¬ 
ing solace and continuity in a world that otherwise seemed frac¬ 
tured, uncertain, and in constant flux. Intellectually justifying this 
appropriation of the past was the theory of evolution, developed 
by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 
(1770-1831), who saw history, and thus reality, as a continuous, 
step-by-step unfolding of events reacting to one another in a 
dialectic. The present thus builds on the past, which it absorbs. 
Hegel’s theory of evolution was the foundation for much nine¬ 
teenth-century thinking and was the critical force behind Charles 
Darwins theory of the evolution of the species (1859) and Karl 
Marxs dialectical materialism, which viewed history as a class 
struggle (1867). In architecture, Hegels theory resulted in the 
appropriation of more or less every known architectural style, 
selected for their associations, picturesque qualities, or exoticism. 
Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, 
Baroque, Chinese, Turkish, Queen Anne, rustic thatched cot¬ 
tage—everything and anything could be found revived in nine¬ 
teenth-century European architecture. It was not unusual for an 
architect to submit several proposals for a single project, each in a 
different style. Nor was it unusual to find several periods repre¬ 
sented in a single building. 

Britain: The Sublime and the Picturesque 

Although British architects experimented with every conceivable 
revival style in the first half of the nineteenth century, Gothic and 
Classical were the clear favorites, Gothic-revival buildings proba¬ 
bly only being outnumbered by Classical-revival ones. However, 
it is an overarching eclecticism that characterizes British architec¬ 
ture in the Romantic era. 

GOTHIC REVIVAL In Britain, sublime architecture peaked in 
the 1790s. In terms of the Gothic revival, this can be seen in James 
Wyatt’s (1746-1813) Fonthill Abbey (fig. 24.28), in Fonthill 
Gifford, Wiltshire, whose owner, William Beckford, wanted to 
upstage the playfulness of Strawberry Hill (see fig. 23.12) and 
build a medieval home that embodied the awe and gloom of 
Gothic romance novels. Rising to a breathtaking 120 feet, it not

only looked like a Gothic cathedral, it was scaled like one. (The 
tower was originally 300 feet high, but it collapsed twice.) The 
entrance door was 35 feet high. The interior was filled with end¬ 
less dark, narrow corridors, which along with its immense soaring 
tower provided a sensation of Burkes "infinite sublime.” The 
exterior was not only awesome in its bold massing, it was also 
picturesque in its syncopated accretion of parts. Beckford, at one 
time one of the richest men in the world, sold Fonthill Abbey in 
1822. In 1825, the tower collapsed once again, and the building 
was essentially destroyed. 


Most revival architects did not aspire to the sublime but satis¬ 
fied their Romantic desires through historicism, exoticism, the 
picturesque, and associational qualities (see page 799). The most 
famous Gothic-revival building is the Fiouses of Parliament (fig. 
24.29) by Sir Charles Barry (1795-1860) and A. W. N. Pugin 
(1812-1852). It was commissioned in 1836 after the former build¬ 
ing burned down, and the competition required the new Fiouses 
be designed in one of two "English” styles, Gothic or 
Elizabethan—91 of the 97 entries were Gothic. Barry, best known 
for his work in Classical- or Renaissance-revival styles, was the

852 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






















head architect. Predictably, he laid out the building in a symmet¬ 
rical, orderly fashion. He wisely hired Pugin, Britain s leading 
expert on the Gothic, to design the Gothic details on both exte¬ 
rior and interior, which he did with meticulous historical accuracy 
in the florid Perpendicular style (see pages 428-29). The pictur¬ 
esque towers are believed to be Pugins contribution as well. 
Instead of being sublime, Gothic revival now is largely pictur¬ 
esque and associational, the style having been specifically selected 
to conjure up a sense of national pride. 

CLASSICAL REVIVAL The vast majority of nineteenth- 
century Classical-revival buildings are straightforward imitations 
of ancient sources. Virtually entire cities, like Glasgow and 
Edinburgh, were built in the Neoclassical style. In the Classical- 
revival style, the sublime is perhaps best represented by John 
Soane (1753-1837), especially in his Bank of England. In 1788, 
Soane was made the surveyor (chief architect) of the bank, a posi¬ 
tion he held almost until his death. During this time the bank 
expanded into a complex aggregate of dozens of enormous build¬ 
ings, all of which Soane designed (most were destroyed in a fire in 
1927). As seen in the Consols Office (fig. 24.30), Soanes scale, 
inspired by Piranesi, was enormous, and his interior was austere, 
a reflection of the influence of Laugier (see page 806), whose trea¬ 
tises he owned in multiple copies. The interior of the Consols 
Office was meant to summon up the sublime grandeur of ancient 
Rome, for the enormous central space that expands into groin- 
and barrel-vaulted bays evokes the Baths of Diocletian, an associ¬ 
ation reinforced by the segmented bathhouse-type windows, 
which for the sake of austerity and emphasis on geometric shape 
were left unframed. 

ECLECTI Cl SM John Nash (1752-1835) is one of the most eclectic 
architects of this period and in a sense epitomizes it. A contempor¬ 
ary of Soane (who was also quite eclectic), he moved from one style

1797-99. Destroyed in 1927 

to the next with agility and lightning speed, often creating designs 
of extraordinary daring. Regardless of style, his hallmark was pic¬ 
turesque variety, with most of his buildings having an asymmetri¬ 
cal massing that made them look like a buildup of additions. One 
day he might design a hamlet with a thatched roof, the next an 
Italianate villa, followed by a mansion with medieval battlements. 

In 1815, Nash turned to the fashionable “Oriental” mode for 
the prince regents Royal Pavilion at Brighton (fig. 24.31). The

building had already been partially erected in a Palladian style 
when he took over, so he was handicapped from the start. He 
quickly solved the problem, however, by throwing an iron arma¬ 
ture over the Palladian facade to support cast-iron onion domes 
and minarets. Quoting Gothic, Chinese, Islamic, and Indian 
architecture, both inside and out, he created a rich fantasy world 
that played to the Romantic desire to be transported to exotic 
places and into the distant past. 

Germany: Creating a New Athens 

Although Prussian architects were as eclectic as their British 
counterparts, they designed some of the finest Classical-revival 
buildings. The most renowned architect is perhaps Karl Friedrich 
Schinkel, named state architect in 1815 by Friedrich Wilhelm III. 

KARL FRIEDRICH SCHINKEL Like many architects of the 
day, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841) worked in every imagi¬ 
nable revival style—Classical, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, 
and Rundbogen , the German term for Italian vernacular construc¬ 
tion. He began as a Neoclassicist, however, as can be seen in the 
Altes Museum in Berlin (fig. 24.32), his second major commis¬ 
sion. Designed in 1824, it was modeled on a Greek temple, in part 
with the intention of endowing the building with the aura of 
being a temple of aesthetic treasures, a place where one came not 
to worship the gods but to contemplate art. The entrance is on 
what looks like the side of a temple (the real sides—their edges 
seen at either end of the colonnaded facade—are plain stone walls 
with rectangular windows), a brilliant device to suggest a temple 
without actually copying one and avoiding the use of the pedi- 
mented facade so common in the Classical revival. The museum is 
raised on a high podium and accessed by a centralized staircase, 
which along with the colossal Grecian order gives the building a 
serene monumentality and strong sense of axis. The width of the 
staircase is echoed above by a second-floor attic, which encases a 


domed room for the display of sculpture. Schinkel is a master of 
perfect proportions and scale, and the symmetrical and logical 
interior echoes the exterior harmony. 

Prussia emerged as a major political force at the Congress of 
Vienna, held after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, and the ambitious 
building program instituted by Friedrich Wilhelm III was 
designed to reinforce his imperial ambitions. Part of the idea 
behind the Altes Museum was to link Berlin with the glory and 
grandeur of ancient Athens. 

America: An Ancient Style for a New Republic 

The Classical-revival style was ubiquitous in America, since the 
new republic modeled itself on the democracies of ancient Greece 
and Rome. The White House and nation’s Capitol are 
Neoclassical, and most churches, banks, and government build¬ 
ings were designed with a Graeco-Roman temple facade, although 
the Gothic was also very popular for churches. 

THOMAS JEFFERSON Thomas Jefferson, an amateur archi¬ 
tect, designed his home Monticello (1770-1782) as a Palladian 
villa, like Burlington’s Chiswick House (see fig. 23.8), and he 
based his Virginia State Capitol (1785) on the Maison Carree in 
Nimes (see fig. 7.44). His best-known project in the Romantic era 
is the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville (fig. 24.33). 
Like Monticello and the Virginia State Capitol, the campus is 
based on antiquity in order to evoke the democratic heritage from 
Greece and Rome as well as the grandeur of these two great civi¬ 
lizations, which form the bedrock of Western art and culture. 
Designed from 1804 to 1817, the campus consists of two rows of 
five Palladian villas connected by a roofed colonnade, off which 
are rooms for students. Each of the ten villas, which housed the 
professors and classrooms, was different, conceptually symboliz¬ 
ing individualism and aesthetically introducing picturesque vari¬ 
ety. Each has a different Classical association: One with a Doric

order refers to the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, a second with an 
Ionic order to the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. At one 
end of the two rows and tying them together is a Pantheon-like 
rotunda, the library, suggested by fellow architect Benjamin 
Latrobe and built in 1823-26. Lastly, the tree-lined lawn 
separating the two rows of villas imparts the complex with the 
naturalism of a picturesque English garden. Jeffersons genius in 
Charlottesville was to use the Classical revival to create a 
metaphor for the new republic that expresses both the individual¬ 
ism and the unity that defined the new nation. His use of 
picturesque variety in the buildings and landscape as well as his 
use of a style that evokes a lost, distant past are qualities that are 
distinctly Romantic. 

BENJAMIN LATROBE The most famous American architect 
during the Federal period was Benjamin Latrobe (1764-1820), 
who in 1795 emigrated from England, where he had been heavily 
influenced by John Soane and the Parisian Claude-Nicolas 
Ledoux (see page 808). A friend of Jefferson—which in part 
accounts for his winning the commission for the U.S. Capitol— 
he built the first Greek-revival building in the United States 
(1798, the severe Bank of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia) and later 
the first Gothic-revival house (Sedgeley Gatehouse, also in 
Philadlephia, where Latrobe lived). His most esteemed building is 
Baltimore Cathedral, designed in 1804-8. The exterior is a rather 
undistinguished Graeco-Roman temple facade with Ionic 
columns. (Latrobe also submitted a Gothic proposal for the 
building.) The interior, however, is an impressive sequence of 
vaulted spaces, the centerpiece of which is a Pantheon-like dome 
springing from an arcade of segmental arches (fig. 24.34). The 
arches and austere piers were inspired by Soane s 1792 Bank Stock 
Office at the Bank of England, while the elegant coffered vaulting 
recalls Robert Adam (see fig. 23.10). The vast interior was meant 
to evoke sublime Roman structures, an interest that can be traced 
back to Piranesi through Soane. 

While Baltimore Cathedral may rank among Latrobe s most 
successful buildings, his most famous is the nations Capitol, 
which along with the White House (another project Latrobe 


advised on when Jefferson became president) firmly established 
Neoclassicism as the nation s official architectural style. Latrobe s 
many students were equally committed to Neoclassicism, result¬ 
ing in most major buildings in America being designed in a 
Neoclassical style.

France: Empire Style 

The course of the Classical revival in France was set by Napoleon, 
who commissioned several Roman structures in Paris to reinforce 
his imperial image. What is today the church of Mary Magdalene, 
in the Place de la Madeleine, was commissioned as a “Temple of 
Glory” to French soldiers and directly modeled on a Roman 
Corinthian temple, the Maison Carree (see fig. 7.44). The Arc de 
Triomphe, of course, was meant to evoke Roman triumphal arches, 
while the 130-foot-high bronze Vendome Column, initially called 
the Column of the Great Army, was modeled on the Column of 
Trajan (see fig. 7.39) and commemorated Napoleons victory at 
Austerlitz in 1805. Little was actually built during Bonaparte’s 
reign, however, and his greatest influence perhaps resulted from 
the interior-design style developed for his residences: Empire Style. 

One of the finest examples is the state bedroom that the archi¬ 
tects Charles Percier (1764-1838) and Pierre-Frangois Fontaine 


(1762-1853) designed for Josephine Bonaparte at the Chateau de 
Malmaison outside of Paris (fig. 24.35). The style is opulent, using 
exotic materials and a saturated palette similar to those we saw in 
Ingress 1806 portrait of Napoleon (see fig. 24.12). The bed, 
decorated with swans and cornucopias, is Roman-inspired, while 
the canopy resembles a military tent and is crowned by an impe¬ 
rial eagle. The tripod washstand is based on the discoveries at 
Herculaneum and Pompeii, although the sphinxes supporting the 
bowl are Egyptian, and the decoration of the bowl itself is 
Greek, an eclecticism characteristic of the Romantic taste for 
picturesque variety and associational references. Despite the rich 
materials, the room does not seem busy; rather, it appears serious 
and ponderous, the result of the deep hues, the weight of the 
objects (even the drapery seems monumental), and an underlying 
geometry. For Napoleon, Percier and Fontaine created an august 
imperial style that corresponded perfectly to the image of the new 
French emperor.

Age of Positivism: Realism, 
Impressionism, and the 
Pre-Raphaelites, 1848-1885 


Pv 1 



R omanticism began to dissipate in Europe as an intellectual 

attitude and stylistic trend after 1848 and was gradually superseded by 
Realism. Increasingly, people came to rely on the physical, physiological, 
empirical, and scientific as a way to understand nature, society, and 
human behavior. Hard facts, not feelings, became the bricks and mortar of 


knowledge. Positivism is the term often used to describe the new 
mentality of pragmatism and materialism that emerged in the 
1840s. The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste 
Comte (1798-1857), who in 1830 began to write a multivolume 
series called Positive Philosophy. Comte called for social progress 
to be based on observable fact and tested ideas—in other words, 
on science. This new scientific approach to studying society came 
to be called sociology. 

Paralleling Comte s sociology was the appearance in the 1830s 
and 1840s of popular and widely distributed pamphlets called 
physiologies. These were short essays that analyzed in tremendous 
detail different niches of French society, not just professions and 
types, such as the Lawyer, the Nun, the Society Woman, but also 
such specific categories as the Suburban Gardener and the Woman 
of 30. In a world undergoing tremendous flux due to rapid indus¬ 
trialization and urbanization, the physiologies were a means of 
understanding the dramatic transformations that were occurring. 

In politics, this new tough pragmatism was called Realpolitik , 
a German word meaning the “politics of reality,” a concept that 
Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898), first chancellor of the German 
Empire, deftly used to create a united Germany toward 1870. 
In religion, Positivism brought about a renewal of eighteenth- 
century skepticism. Epitomizing Positivism is the rise of photo- 

Detail of figure 25.12, Edgar Degas, The Orchestra of the Paris Opera 


graphy in the 1840s, which most people perceived not as an art 
form but as a tool for faithfully recording nature and document¬ 
ing the rapidly changing world. 

In the arts, Positivism resulted in Realism. Now, artists and 
writers did not bury their heads in the Classical, historical past 
nor view the modern world through rose-tinted glasses or 
Romantic notions of the exciting and exotic. Instead they concen¬ 
trated on contemporary life, and they presented it unembellished 
and unidealized. And because it was changing so rapidly, they 
presented it as fleeting too. As early as 1846, the poet and critic 
Charles Baudelaire called for an art based on modern life, writing 
that “The pageant of fashionable life and the thousands of 
floating existences—criminals and kept women—which drift 
about in the underworld of a great city...all prove to us that we 
have only to open our eyes to recognize our heroism.” By the 
1850s, realisme was the rallying cry of the new art and literature. 
The evangelist of Realism was critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary 
(1831-1888), who in his 1857 Salon review wrote: “There is no 
need to return to history, to take refuge in legends, to summon 
powers of imagination. Beauty is before the eyes, not in the brain; 
in the present, not in the past; in truth, not in dreams. ” 

Instead of valuing wild flights of imagination, the exotic, and 
the sublime, Realists planted both feet firmly on the ground and, 
generally without emotion, bluntly depicted modern life. This 
ranged from the grim existence of country peasants and the 
downtrodden urban poor to the leisure activities of the rapidly

growing metropolitan middle class and nouveau riche. In land¬ 
scape painting, this Realism evolved into Impressionism. Often 
working in the environs of Paris as well as in the city itself, the 
Impressionist painters documented the transformation of the 
landscape from rural to suburban, recording the incursion into 
the countryside of factories and railroads. They observed, too, the 
influx of moneyed Parisians, who built fancy weekend villas in 
farm villages, raced sailboats in regattas on such waterways as the 
Seine and Oise rivers, and dined, danced, and swam at fashionable 
riverside establishments. Painting rapidly outdoors with bold 
brushstrokes and strong colors, the Impressionists empirically 
captured the world before their very eyes, the shimmering sketch¬ 
iness of their finished paintings reflecting the impermanence of a 
constantly changing contemporary world. 

While the Impressionists were committed to creating an 
empirical representational art—a realistic art—a byproduct of 
their stylistic developments was the advent of Modernism. To the 
following generations, their bright colors and broad brushwork— 
that is, the abstract qualities of their works—seemed to challenge 
the representational components as the subject matter of the 
painting. In the early twentieth century, critics and historians 
would label this shift in art toward abstraction as “Modernism. ” 
Impressionism also marked the appearance of the avant-garde, 
the notion that certain artists and ideas are strikingly new or 
radical for their time. This meant, in effect, that artists began 
making art that was only understood by a handful of people, 
namely other avant-garde artists and a few art experts, including 


collectors. The disconnect between the avant-garde and the gen¬ 
eral public, including the working class, who felt comfortable 
attending the highly publicized academy exhibitions, is reflected 
in the rise of commercial art galleries as the principal venue for the 
display of new art and the corresponding decline in power of aca¬ 
demic Salons throughout the Western world. But while Realism 
served as a springboard for the abstraction of Modernism, we 
must remember that first and foremost it was a movement preoc¬ 
cupied with the dramatic changes occurring in society, and that its 
birth coincides with the great European-wide revolutions of 1848. 

REALISM IN FRANCE 

The year 1848 was one of uprising in France. Republicans, 
liberals, and socialists (those advocating a classless society in 
which either a popular collective or the government controls the 
means of production) united that year to demand an increased 
voice in government, and when King Louis-Philippe refused, 
armed conflict was imminent. The king abdicated. A provisional 
government was soon replaced by the Constituent Assembly. But 
the working class was still not represented; already organized into 
labor camps instituted by the new government, it revolted, storm¬ 
ing Parliament. War raged in the streets of Paris, and 10,000 peo¬ 
ple were killed or wounded. This proletarian rebellion produced 
shock waves of class revolution that radiated throughout Europe, 
resulting in similar uprisings in major cities. Even Britain was 


860 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






















threatened, as the Chartists, a socialist group, agitated for work¬ 
ers’ rights, going so far as to gather arms and conduct military 
drills. As one contemporary French writer said, European society 
was “prey to a feeling of terror incomparable to anything since 
the invasion of Rome by the barbarians. ” It is no coincidence that 
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published their Communist 
Manifesto the same year. 

The forces of conservatism ultimately prevailed everywhere. 
In France, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (1808-1873), the emperors 
nephew, was elected president of the Second Republic, largely on 
name recognition. In 1852, however, he dissolved Parliament and 
arranged to have himself “elected” emperor, becoming Napoleon 
III and establishing the Second Empire. France prospered under 
his reign, which ended in 1870 with the Franco-Prussian War. 

The pace of the Industrial Revolution, which had not gained 
momentum in France until the 1840s, now increased dramatically, 
largely due to new financial systems instituted by Louis 
Napoleon, systems that also created unprecedented wealth. 
Dominated by financiers, industrialists, manufacturers, lawyers, 
and merchants, the bourgeoisie flourished, as did their hunger for 
material possessions. Reflecting the new consumerism was the 
1855 Paris Universal Exposition, or World’s Fair, in which coun¬ 
tries from all over the world displayed their products. The 
Parisian exposition was a competitive response to the first inter¬ 
national trade fair presented in London in 1851, the Great 
Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations. In Paris, the 
new wealth and increased time for leisure activities gave rise to 
grand restaurants, cafes, department stores, theaters, clubs, parks, 
and racetracks, where people, often from different social classes, 
congregated and shopped. 

Paris itself received a makeover, taking on its glorious mod¬ 
ern-day form when, beginning in 1853, Georges-Eugene 
Haussmann (1809-1891), Louis Napoleons minister of the inte¬ 
rior, initiated huge municipal improvements. Among them was 
the creation of magnificent wide avenues that cut through the 
dark, dank, medieval rabbit warren of the Old City and that were 
flanked by chic modern apartment buildings. The result was 
spectacular perspectives (and arteries that permitted the rapid 
deployment of troops in the event of more insurrections), punc¬ 
tuated by beautifully landscaped parks, gardens, and squares, and 
anchored by grand civic buildings, including an opera house and 
stately railway stations. The boulevards opened up the city, per¬ 
mitting increased light and color, making the urban environment 
seem more salubrious, which it was. This new city is what the 
Impressionists would capture on their canvases. 

Realism in the 1840s and 1850s: 

Painting Contemporary Social Conditions 

French Realism arose simultaneously with the revolution of 1848. 
Especially in the hands of Gustave Courbet, the self-proclaimed 
banner-carrier of this art movement, and Jean-Frangois Millet, 
the painter of peasants, Realism was a highly political style. It 
championed laborers and common country folk, groups that 


challenged the authority and privilege of the Parisian aristocracy 
and bourgeoisie and were in part responsible for the upheavals 
of 1848. 

GUSTAVE COURBET Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) came 
from Ornans, a town at the foot of the Jura mountains near the 
Swiss border, where his father, a former peasant, was a prosperous 
landowner and vintner. He went to Paris in 1839 to study paint¬ 
ing, and by the late 1840s had become a dominant figure at the 
new bohemian cafes on the Left Bank. There, Courbet met the 
literary avant-garde, befriending Baudelaire, the socialist journal¬ 
ist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and the critic and writer 
Champfleury. Largely under the influence of Proudhon, Courbet, 
already a republican, became a socialist. Meanwhile, Champfleury 
swayed him toward Realism. Champfleury, who collected folk art 
and was interested in such nonelitist art forms as popular prints, 
children’s art, and caricatures, convinced Courbet to return to his 
rural roots and paint the simple world of Ornans. 

In the fall of 1849, Courbet returned to Ornans, and there in 
his family’s attic painted the 22-foot-wide Burial at Ornans (fig. 
25.1), which was accepted at the Salon of 1850-51. The picture 
was an affront to many viewers. It presented common provincial 
folk, portrayed in a coarse, heavy form, without a shred of ele¬ 
gance or idealization. The people of Ornans, many of whom can 
be identified, posed for Courbet, and the artist not only docu¬ 
mented their clothes and bearing but their distinguishing facial 
features, which included bulbous noses, grotesquely wrinkled 
faces, and unkempt hair. The bleak overcast landscape is equally 
authentic, based on studies made at Ornans cemetery. Courbet’s 
Realism extends to the democratic presentation of the figures. 
Despite bold brushwork and a chiaroscuro vaguely reminiscent of 
his favorite artists, Rembrandt and Velazquez, the picture has no 
Baroque drama and no compositional structure to emphasize one 
figure over another—the dog is as important as the priest or 
mayor. Nor does it use Classical formulas, as Benjamin West did 
in his pyramidal groupings in The Death of General Wolfe (see fig. 
23.6). Instead, the image embraces the bold, simple compositions 
found in such popular art forms, as broadsides, almanacs, and 
song sheets—the art of the people, not the academy. 

The picture seems so matter-of-fact it is difficult to know what 
it is about. We see pallbearers and the coffin on the left, then a 
priest and assistants, followed by small-town patricians and, to 
the right, womenfolk. An open grave is in the foreground center. 
We do not even know whose funeral it is. Nor is it clear that this 
is a statement about the finality of death, although that is the 
strongest candidate for an overriding theme. Clearly, the picture 
is a document of social ritual that accurately observes the distinc¬ 
tions of gender, profession, and class in Ornans. More important, 
it brazenly elevates provincial bourgeois events to a lofty status 
equal to that of historical events. In effect, it is an assault on the 
highly esteemed genre of history painting. As such, Courbet’s 
work repulsed many Parisians. Equally unsavory was the politi¬ 
cal threat represented by the Ornans bourgeoisie, who under 
the Second Republic had considerable voting power, capable of

swaying national elections. Furthermore, they were a sobering 
reminder to many members of the Parisian bourgeoisie of their 
own provincial and even peasant origins, which many tried 
to hide. 

Courbet exhibited a second Ornans painting in the Salon of 
1850-51, The Stone Breakers (fig. 25.2). Here, he presents on a 
confrontational, life-size scale two workers he met on the out¬ 
skirts of town who were pounding stones to make gravel for a 


road. Again, Courbet portrays the figures with complete veracity, 
their poverty and social class announced by their ragged clothes, 
by the coarseness of their labor, and by the dirt under their finger¬ 
nails. He gives the workers the same detailed intensity as the 
stones, and the fact that their faces cannot be seen virtually trans¬ 
forms them into inanimate objects, like the rocks and tools. Once 
more, the composition lacks conventional structure, resulting in 
our eye jumping from one fact to another.

862 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 









While the public variously condemned and praised the picture 
for having a socialist message, both political sides admired the 
image s materiality. As in the Burial , Courbet used a broad appli¬ 
cation of paint, sometimes troweling it on with a palette knife, 
in effect transforming the artist into an artisan-laborer. This bold 
paint application reinforces the powerful physicality of the 
figures and by its physical presence virtually stands in for the 
material objects. In both Burial and Stone Breakers , figures are 
sandwiched into a shallow space. They are pushed up to the 
surface of the canvas, and the landscape behind is so flat it seems 
like a backdrop that forces our eye to stay in the foreground. 
Courbet would never admit to having a socialist agenda in Stone 
Breakers , but this “complete expression of human misery,” as the 
artist himself described it, is obviously about social injustice and 
a product of the revolution of 1848. Rather than presenting rural 
life as pastoral or comic, as had been traditional in art, Courbet 
depicts its harsh reality. 

In 1855, Courbet had 11 paintings accepted for the Paris 
Universal Exposition, a world trade fair designed to promote 
French commerce and industry. The fairs fine-art section 
replaced the Salon exhibition that year and featured such famous 
French masters as Ingres and Delacroix. To promote his career, 
Courbet created a sensation by doing what no living artist had 
ever done before: He commissioned a Classically inspired build¬ 
ing near the fair where he mounted his own one-person show, 
which included Burial at Ornans. He titled his exhibition Du 
Realisme (On Realism) and sold a pamphlet, a “Manifesto of 
Realism. ” In it, he made the following proclamation: “To be in a 
position to translate the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my 
epoch according to my own estimation: to be not only a painter, 
but a man as well, in short to create living art—this is my goal. ” 
At every turn, Courbet challenged academic values. He replaced 
the hallowed Greek and Roman tradition with bold images of the 
contemporary world, images that contained no references, either 
iconographic or compositional, to the Classical tradition or 
history painting. He daringly troweled paint onto the canvas, 
undermining the refinement of academic paint handling, whether 
the Neoclassical hard smooth surface of Ingres or the painterly 
Venetian and Rubensian tradition found in Delacroix; and while 
not rejecting the Salons, he refused to rely on them to promote his 
career and instead turned to commercial exhibition. 

JEAN-FRANQOIS MILLET We can see how matter-of-fact in 
presentation and unemotional Courbet s pictures are if we com¬ 
pare them with another Realist entry at the Salon of 1850-51, The 
Sower (fig. 25.3), by Jean-Frangois Millet (1814-1875). Fike 
Courbet, Millet had a rural upbringing. Born into a family of 
well-to-do farmers near Cherbourg in Normandy, he grew up 
steeped in the land and the timeless seasonal cycle of farm life. He 
was well educated and well read, and after choosing a career in 
painting and studying in both Cherbourg and Paris, he began by 
making portraits, using a dark palette that reflected his love of 
seventeenth-century Spanish painting and Rembrandt. In the late 
1840s, when back in Paris, he befriended several of the landscape 


painters of the Barbizon School (see page 849), and in 1848 he 
produced his first peasant picture, Le Vanneur (The Grain Sifier). 
Pictures of peasant life would be his specialty for the remainder of 
his life. In 1848, after an outbreak of cholera in Paris, Millet 
settled permanently in Barbizon. 

Coming on the heels of the revolution of 1848, Millets 
pictures dignifying the peasantry were read politically. As seen in 
The Sower , his workers, like Courbet s, are poor and downtrod¬ 
den: They wear tattered clothing and are consigned to a life of 
grueling work on the land. Shadowy and enormous, they were 
frightening to a Parisian audience still reeling from the revolution 
of 1848. More threatening yet, Millet ennobled them. The anony¬ 
mous sower is monumental in size, a massive dynamic form 
consuming most of the picture frame. He is not so much an indi¬ 
vidual, as are Courbet s figures in Burial at Ormans , but a type— 
the noble farmworker, who is poorly paid for his labor. Using a 
dark chiaroscuro reminiscent of Rembrandt, Millet casts the laborer 
in murky shadow, making him blend in with the soil from which 
he seems to emerge. He is the embodiment of the earth, a reading 
enhanced by the gritty coarseness of Millet s paint. The dramatic

sweep of the gesture and the undulating contours of the body 
align him with the eternal cyclical forces of nature itself. While a 
Realist in his peasant subject, Millet is clearly a Romantic in sen¬ 
sibility, his pictures aspiring to poetry and mood, not sheer fact. 

HONORE DAUMIER Also appearing for the first time in the 
Salons at this time was Honore Daumier (1808-1879). Daumier 
was famous as a caricaturist but virtually unknown as a painter. 
His lithographs began appearing regularly in Paris newspapers 
about 1830. (See Materials and Techniques , page 911.) The emer¬ 
gence of a sizeable and literate bourgeois public and the develop¬ 
ment of inexpensive paper and printing processes resulted in the 
modern-day newspaper, made all the more popular by being illus¬ 
trated with lithographs and woodcuts. Daumier worked mostly 
for the socialist newspapers La Caricature and Le Charivari , both 
devoted to political and social satire. This was a perfect match, for 
Daumier was passionate about social causes, dedicating his life to 
exposing evil, from the corrupt and repressive activities of the 
government to the avarice and vanity of the nouveau riche. His 
brilliant lithographs quickly and subtly documented the different 
professions, classes, and types emerging in a rapidly growing and 
changing Paris, in some respects paralleling the lengthy factual 
descriptions of the physiology pamphlets. His characterizations 
anticipated the observations of types found in the urban Realists 
and Impressionists of the 1860s and 1870s. We can see Daumiers 
sharp eye, caustic humor, and succinct draftsmanship in It's Safe 
to Release This One! (fig. 25.4), made in 1834 after a workers’ 
uprising in Paris that resulted in the deaths of numerous poor and 
innocent citizens at the hands of government forces. It presents a 
caricature of the overweight pear-shaped King Louis-Philippe,

who, feeling no pulse in a chained emaciated worker, announces 
he is now free to go. 

Daumier undoubtedly wanted to be considered a fine artist, 
and with this in mind exhibited a handful of paintings at the 
Salons of 1849 and 1850-51. He was ignored, however. For the 
rest of his life he painted privately, exhibiting only once more, 
1877, the year before he died, at Durand-Ruel, a major commer¬ 
cial gallery in Paris. His paintings were therefore essentially 
unknown. It appears Daumier taught himself to paint during the

1840s. In contrast to his commercial work, his oils are pure 
compassion. He dispensed with humor and satire and, relying on 
his caricaturist s ability to concisely capture character and types, 
uncannily nailed the psychology of contemporary urban life, as 
seen in The Third-Class Carriage (fig. 25.5), made about 1863-65. 
Here, he renders a peculiarly modern condition, “the lonely 
crowd,” in which throngs of workers are jammed into a third- 
class railway car, consigned to hard benches in contrast to the 
wide plush seats of first-class cars. A range of types, all anony¬ 
mous, and part of the growing urban masses, endure their daily 
commute. The weary family in the foreground is the focus of the 
picture. They are simpler and poorer than the top-hatted petits 
bourgeois behind them and seem to represent the uprooted rural 
poor who have come to Paris in search of opportunity, only to 
become victims of modern urbanism. Silent and tired, they are 
imprisoned in a turgid gloom, shut off from the wholesome bright 
light seen through the windows. But Daumier presents them with 
fortitude and dignity, for the two women have the monumental 
forms we saw in Millet s Sower. What appears to be a simple 
peasant family is transformed into the Mother and Child with 
St. Elizabeth. Like Millet, whom he admired, Daumier is alter¬ 
nately labeled a Realist and a Romantic, his paintings similarly 
combining Realist subject matter with the powerful compassion 
of a Romantic. 

ROSA BONHEUR A fourth Realist exhibiting at the Salon of 
1850-51 was Rosa Bonheur, who garnered considerable attention. 
She studied with her father, a drawing instructor and socialist, 
who advocated full equality for women. From early on, Bonheur 
was determined to become a successful woman in a mans world. 


Instead of making the small still lifes and watercolors traditionally 
associated with women, Bonheur became an animal painter and 
worked on a large scale, displaying the technical finesse of the 
finest academicians. Rather than the exotic animals of the 
Romantic world of Delacroix and Barye, Bonheur painted farm 
animals, including cows, horses, and sheep. Influenced by the 
scientific empiricism of natural history, she presented specific 
species, carefully studying each and accurately rendering them, 
often in minute detail. Bonheur began showing at the Salon of 
1841, and during the course of the decade, her reputation grew. 
(See v m.) 

In 1848, the new Second Republic, reflecting a Positivist com¬ 
punction to document French regional agriculture, commissioned 
a large painting from Bonheur. At the Salon of 1850-51, she 
unveiled the 8-foot-wide result, Plowing in the Nivernais: The 
Dressing ofVines (fig. 25.6). The inspiration for this subject is 
believed to be The Devil's Pool (1846), a novel by George Sand 
(1804-1876), who, as a successful woman author, was a role model 
for Bonheur. In the books preface, Sand announced that the novel 
“brings back civilized man to the charms of primitive life.” As 
industrialization was beginning to transform France, creating 
complex urban centers filled with such ills as overcrowding, poor 
housing, class conflict, and dislocated migrants, Sand advocated a 
return to nature, to a simple “primitive” world, a theme also 
found in Millet s paintings and one that would become popular 
with the cultural community in the closing decades of the century 
Bonheur s interest in animals in part reflected her own interest in 
nature, and after 1860, she left Paris and permanently settled in 
the rural forest of Fontainebleau, near Barbizon. There she lived 
with her companion, Nathalie Micas, and challenged societal 


CHAPTER 25 THE AGE OF POSITIVISM: REALISM, IMPRESSIONISM, AND THE PRE-RAPHAELITES, 1848-1885 865 




conventions about women by wearing mens clothing, cropping 
her hair short, and smoking in public. 

To create Plowing in the Nivernais , Bonheur spent weeks in 
the region, a rural area in central France, studying the unique 
qualities of the land, animals, farm tools, and regional dress, all of 
which Salon-goers recognized in her tightly painted detailed pic¬ 
ture and responded to favorably. Unlike Millet s Sower , her image 
is factual and unemotional, and in contrast to Courbet s Ornans 
paintings, it plays down the unseemly qualities of rural life. We 
may see the ponderous weight of the enormous Nivernais oxen, 
but we experience no stench of animals, no sweat of labor, and no 
smell of earth, although it is all represented. Like the physiologies , 
Bonheur documents, catalogues, and presents. The large size of 
the oxen and the processional planar alignment lend a grandeur to 
the scene, which, combined with the tight paint handling, give the 
picture something of a Classical or academic aura that made it 
more palatable to a conservative public than Courbets and 
Millet s more threatening images. 

The Realist Assault on Academic 
Values and Bourgeois Taste 

By presenting the provincial bourgeoisie and peasants on a scale 
usually reserved for history painting, Courbet launched an assault 
on the values of the French Academy and bourgeois taste. In 
effect, he declared contemporary life, and especially contempo¬ 
rary social conditions, just as valid (if not more so) a subject for 
painting as historical events, and his emergence signals the death 
knell for the traditional hierarchy of the genres that can be traced 
back to the establishment of the academies. (Ironically, vanguard 
artists would return to history and religious painting in the 
closing decades of the century.) Courbet s rejection of academic 
values in order to depict the social conditions of the modern 
world was taken up by Edouard Manet (1832-1883) in the 1860s. 
Focusing on urban rather than rural life, he painted musical 
gatherings in the Bois de Boulogne, the new park on the western 
outskirts of Paris where the upper classes came to be seen, and he 
painted the fashionable throngs who congregated at Longchamp, 
the new racetrack, also in the Bois. He painted chic masked balls 
held at the opera, courtesans with their clients, and the leisure 
activities at the new cafes, dance halls, and restaurants. His pic¬ 
tures are often complex, loaded with references, and densely 
layered with multiple readings. They are so rich as to be able to 
comment on academic values while capturing the energy, psy¬ 
chology, and changes occurring in modern society. This is espe¬ 
cially true of The Luncheon on the Grass (see fig. 25.10), which he 
submitted to the Salon of 1863. To understand this picture, it is 
first necessary to look at the academic values that prevailed in the 
1860s and that were used by the Salon jury. 

OFFICIAL ART AND ITS EXEMPLARS While it is danger¬ 
ous to characterize any one kind of art as being “academic” and 
promoted at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in the 1860s, many 
if not most of the academicians still believed in the supremacy of 


history painting, the Graeco-Roman paradigm, and the highly 
finished Neoclassical style of paint handling epitomized by 
Ingres. Among the more popular subjects was the female nude, 
and images of nudes plastered the walls of the Salons. However, 
these were not ordinary nudes, for they were all Venuses, Dianas, 
bacchantes, or nymphs: that is, they were noble beings with a 
Classical pedigree. Equally popular were nudes in genre scenes 
located in an exotic setting, such as a harem, as seen in Ingres s 
Grande Odalesque (see fig. 24.13), or in the distant past, such as 
ancient Rome. Nonetheless, the pictures were esteemed since they 
continued the Classical tradition of beauty and perfection. 

The most prominent academic painter of the period was 
Adolphe-William Bouguereau (1824-1905), who became presi¬ 
dent of the Institute of France and the French Legion of Honor. 
In addition to gypsies, peasant girls, and religious themes, he 
painted mythological scenes, such as Nymphs and a Satyr (fig. 
25.7) of 1873. Here, nymphs playfully tug a satyr into the water 
in an image that is overtly erotic, as epitomized by the back¬ 
ground nymph clutching the satyr s horn in unabashed ecstasy. 
Heightening the sensuality of flesh, gesture, and expression is

Bouguereau s detailed naturalism, which reflects a Positivist pen¬ 
chant to record. Even Bouguereau s idealized women seem real 
and not goddesslike, not just because of their naturalistic flesh but 
also because they are voluptuous—they look more contemporary 
than Greek or Roman. 

Despite upholding the Classical tradition into the twentieth 
century, Bouguereau is far from being just a standard-bearer of 
a dying tradition. Besides his remarkable technical finesse, his 
pictures are distinguished by a powerful psychology—here of 
erotic abandonment—which will preoccupy artists later in the 
nineteenth century. His images are often set against a backdrop of 
nature, reinforcing the expression of elemental desires and reflect¬ 
ing the periods desire to escape from the complex world of 
urbanization and industrialization to simpler times of Arcadian 
and rural retreats. 

Sculpture remained tied to the Classical tradition and similarly 
often focused on the female nude. One of the outstanding sculp¬ 
tors from the period was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (1827-1875), 
and among his best-known works is The Dance (fig. 25.8), one of 
four marbles commissioned in 1867 for the public facade of the 
new Paris Opera, each sculpture representing a component of 


opera as an art form. In the plaster model reproduced here— 
which is livelier and more precise than the finished marble— 
Dance is represented by an erect, winged allegorical male, who 
serves as an erotic maypole around which gleeful, well-propor¬ 
tioned bacchantes worshipfully prance. The satyr lurking under 
Dance s cape underscores the licentious intentions of their ritual¬ 
istic play, which is presented within a more serious, artistic 
concept of dance. 

When The Dance was unveiled in 1869, critics panned it, 
declaring that the figures looked drunk, vulgar, and indecent. The 
naturalism certainly makes the dancers look undressed rather 
than nude; we see elbows, kneecaps, and rolls of flesh on bodies 
that Canova (see fig. 23.30) would have presented perfectly 
smooth. While the figures may evoke antiquity, they do not look 
quite Greek or Roman but rather Second Empire. Within a year, 
however, eyes had adjusted to Carpeauxs naturalism and the 
egregiously erotic work was hailed as a great monument in the 
Classical tradition. 

Because of its dynamic Baroque composition and excessive¬ 
ness (too much flesh, too much mirth), The Dance was a perfect 
complement for its setting, the Opera (fig. 25.9) designed by 
Charles Gamier (1825-1898), which was built from 1861 to 
1874 and shared the same qualities. The Opera has become an 
emblem of the opulence and extravagance of the Second Empire, 
reflecting the pretentious taste of the bourgeois audience that 
patronized the academic or Classical tradition. The building was 
a lynchpin in Haussmann s design for Paris, the dramatic focal 
point for the Avenue de POpera, as well as the hub for several 
other major arteries. 

The Opera marks the extension of nineteenth-century revival 
styles to the Baroque, rivaling the Classical and Gothic revivals 
before 1860. With the double-columned colonnade Gamier sug¬

Napoleon in a line of descent from Louis XIV. The segmented 
arches springing from the columns at either end of the facade 
recall Lescots Square Court of the Louvre (see fig. 18.2). The 
endless variety of colors and textures, the dazzling accretion of 
sculpture and decoration, and the extensive borrowing and 
recombining of architectural forms from the Renaissance and the 
Baroque—just the sheer density of everything —resulted in an 
opulent, ostentatious style that paralleled the materialistic 
conspicuous consumption of the period and appealed to nouveau 
riche tastes, although it was disdained by the old-moneyed 
aristocracy. The focal point of the interior was a dramatic grand 
staircase, which served as a stage on which high society paraded 
in order to be seen. 

EDOUARD MANET Manets The Luncheon on the Grass (fig. 
25.10) was a condemnation of bourgeois values and academic taste 
as well as a statement of what art should be about—the modern 
world. Manet himself came from a Parisian bourgeois back¬ 
ground, and studied with a famous academician, Thomas Couture 
(1815-1879). His true masters were the painterly artists he copied 
at the Louvre—Hals, Titian, Velazquez, and Goya. He was a 
regular at the cafes, befriending Courbet, who was his role model, 
as well as Baudelaire and the Realist novelist and art critic Emile 
Zola (1840-1902). Like many Realist writers and artists, Manet 
was a flaneur , a social type that surfaced as early as the 1830s, 
when the physiology pamphlets began appearing. The flaneur was 
an impeccably dressed man with perfect manners who kept 
abreast of current events through newspapers and gossip. His day 


was spent inconspicuously strolling the streets of Paris and 
observing the fleeting moments of modern life, which he then 
translated into a painted or written image. The flaneur was witty 
and gregarious and delighted in shocking the bourgeois. Manet s 
close friend Baudelaire ranks among the most famous flaneurs of 
the period. 

Out of this background Manet produced the Luncheon , which 
shows two couples picnicking in the Bois de Boulogne. The paint¬ 
ing was rejected by the 1863 Salon jurors. But that year the jurors 
rejected a record number of artists, causing such a popular outcry 
that Louis Napoleon declared there would be a Salon des Refuses 
{Salon of the Refused ), to be held in a separate building but in 
conjunction with the official Salon of 1863. Many of the rejected 
artists preferred not to participate in what was perceived as an 
inferior exhibition. Manet, however, did take part. 

The public showed up in record numbers to laugh at the 
rejects, and especially to view Manets Luncheon , which was 
front-page news in the papers. Luncheon created a scandal by pre¬ 
senting a contemporary scene of a naked woman in a park with 
two nattily dressed men. The public was outraged, for obviously 
the nude had to be a prostitute. It did not matter that critics 
acknowledged that the painting was inspired by the well-known 
Renaissance Fete Champetre (see fig. 16.30) in the Louvre, which 
similarly presented a nude seated with two dressed men. One 
writer even correctly recognized that the seated group exactly 
replicates the poses of river-gods in a print of about 1520 by 
Marcantonio Raimondi after Raphael s The Judgment of Paris (see 
fig. 16.28). No mention was made, however, that the woman in a

shift in the background is based on Watteau s The Bather , also in 
the Louvre. In fact, Manet originally used this title for his painting. 

As far as the critics were concerned, referencing these august 
sources was not enough to justify Manet s flagrant lack of deco¬ 
rum, a crime he brazenly committed on a canvas roughly 7 by 9 
feet, a scale generally reserved for history painting. So, why did 
Manet base his contemporary scene on historical sources? The 
answer may lie in the seemingly deliberate artificiality of his fig¬ 
ures. As pointed out by one art historian, they look like Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts students posing to re-create a famous painting. In 
effect, Manet is telling us the present cannot live in the past, which 
many academicians chose to do. As trumpeted by Baudelaire in 
1846, Manet was declaring that artists must find their subject mat¬ 
ter, their heroes, in the modern world. Furthermore, he was 
exposing the disguised eroticism that the tradition of the Classical 
nude had now stooped to. It is possible that Manet also used his¬ 
torical sources as a device to put himself into the long tradition of 
great art. In effect, he is announcing that his Realism is not only 
the most valid direction for art to take, but in addition that it is as 
important and vital as the great art of the past. 

What convinced the jurors and public that Manet was an 
incompetent sensationalist who deserved to be relegated to the 
Salon des Refuses was his style. To their academically focused 
eyes, he could neither model nor create convincing space. The pic¬ 
ture looked like a preliminary sketch, not a finished picture. The 
figures are two-dimensional cutouts, flattened by their crisp, sil¬ 
houetting contours and a flourish of broad brushstrokes that dis¬ 
pense with the halftones between dark and light needed to mold 
volume—a shadow indicating a fold on a pants leg, for example, 


is rendered with one bold, black sweep of the brush. Cogent space 
is upended by making the woman wading in the background too 
large for her recessed location so that she seems to float over the 
seated group in front of her. All of the objects—figures, trees, the 
colorful still life of clothes and basket—hover in space, failing to 
connect and assemble into a coherent spatial structure. 

Manet has undermined the order of the illusionistic 
Renaissance window and replaced it with a new unifying logic— 
a sensual sea of brushwork composed of lush, oily, and thickly 
applied paint that dramatically covers the entire surface of his can¬ 
vas. Our eyes delight in the lusciousness of his brushwork, the 
wonderful variety of his Velazquez- and Goya-inspired blacks, 
the range of greens in the grass, and the deft play of darks next to 
lights that makes our eyes jump from one light area to another 
and from one dark patch to the next. These abstract qualities— 
paint handling and value contrasts, for example—are the new 
structure of painting, not illusionistic space and modeling. With 
The Luncheon on the Grass , Manet began what twentieth-century 
critics would consider the Modernist tradition, a tradition that 
emphasized the abstract qualities of art and that would continue 
for the next 100 years. Manet undoubtedly delighted in how the 
unfinished, sketchy look of his paintings irreverently countered 
the slick drawing and modeling of the academic tradition and 
shocked bourgeois taste. Additionally, he used it to create a sense 
of dynamic energy and of the momentary that reflected the 
quickly changing modern world, the world captured by the 
flaneurs perspicacious eye. 

Surprisingly, Manet was accepted into the Salon of 1865, 
for his Olympia (fig. 25.11), painted in 1863, is unequivocally a 


CHAPTER 25 THE AGE OF POSITIVISM: REALISM, IMPRESSIONISM, AND THE PRE-RAPHAELITES, 1848-1885 869 








courtesan, a prostitute with a wealthy, upper-class clientele. This 
nude, based on Titians Venus ofUrbino (see fig. 17.35), is the 
Second Empire gentlemans idea of a modern-day goddess, and 
everyone in Paris knew it, since Olympia was a common name 
adopted by powerful courtesans and kept women. With its 
Classical ring, the name was also a sly attack on the allegorical 
veiling of erotic nudes that appeared in the Salons. 

Manets Olympia portrays a reality of contemporary Paris: 
Many wealthy men—the same ones who bought academic nudes 
for their eroticism, not for their smokescreen Classicism—kept 
mistresses and visited prostitutes. Unlike Titian s Venus, Manets 
Olympia is more real than idealized—she is angular, awkward, 
and harsh rather than voluptuously curvilinear. Furthermore, she 
is all business, returning our gaze with a daringly confident stare, 
a power stare that made men uncomfortable and fulfilled their 
worst fears of controlling, independent women. She engages the 
viewer in a way rarely seen in genre painting, reflecting Manets 
interest in the new Parisian social mobility, the interaction of 
classes, and the importance of money and commodities in con¬ 
temporary life.

EDGAR DEGAS AND JAPONISME Like Manet, Edgar Degas 
(1834-1917) came from a wealthy background, his father heading 
up the Paris branch of a family bank. And like Manet, he was 
something of a flaneur , although too much of a recluse to be 
considered a full-blown one. Initially he aspired to be a history 
painter. An admirer of Ingres, Degas emphasized drawing and 
modeling in his early work. By 1865, he had entered Manet and 
Baudelaire s orbit at the Cafe Guerbois, and now he turned to 
capturing modern Paris in his work. He developed a Manet- 
inspired painterly approach to his subject matter, as well as inno¬ 
vative compositional devices that give his images a spontaneous, 
transitory quality. Furthermore, he put a viewer in the voyeuris¬ 
tic position of the unobserved flaneur. Now he started painting 
the new Haussmann boulevards, the millinery shops, Longchamp 
racetrack, cafe concerts, opera, bars, cafes, and ballet dancers at 
the Opera. His sharp eye captured types from all levels of society, 
from the bourgeoisie and performers, to the socially marginalized 
and the working class. 

A classic work from the 1860s is The Orchestra of the Paris 
Opera (fig. 25.12). The painting began as a portrait of the bas¬ 
soonist, in the center foreground, but was extended to include the 
other musicians and the dancers onstage. Essentially the picture is 
a genre scene of the orchestra pit, an unusual subject for a paint¬ 
ing, although a precedent had been created by Daumier. Yet the 
subject here is not just the talented, toiling performers but the 
intensity, excitement, and fragmentation of contemporary life 
itself, which is presented in a matter-of-fact way. Degas has put us 
virtually in the pit, and we feel like unobserved voyeurs. Our view 
is not head-on but at an angle, which is unusual for a painting but 
certainly typical for a theatergoer. The bass violinist is arbitrarily 
cropped on the right, suggesting we are looking at the left side of 
the orchestra, seeing only a fragment of a complete view. The 
same is true of the ballet dancers, whose heads and legs are 
chopped off. X-rays have revealed that Degas cut the painting 
down at the top and sides after finishing it in order to further 
fragment the image. 

Building on this energy are the planes of the wall, the stage, 
the front row of the orchestra, and the ballet dancers, all of which 
are slightly skewed, along with the angular thrust of the instru¬ 
ments and dancers 5 legs and arms. Space seems compressed, as far 
and near are dramatically juxtaposed, for example in the dark 
head of the bass and brightly colored tutus. The image seems to 
climb up the picture plane rather than recede in space. A precise 
line, retained from Degas s academic studies, still outlines figures 
and objects, but a sporadic spray of dashing brushwork, readily 
seen in the dancers 5 tutus, adds spontaneity and a fragmentary 
quality, giving us a feeling of the fleeting moment. 

Scholars often attribute Degas s innovative compositions to 
the influence of Japanese prints, which flooded the Parisian mar¬ 
ket in the late 1850s. In 1853, American Commodore Matthew 
Perry steamed into Tokyo Bay with four warships and forced 
Japan to open its doors to the West after two centuries of isola¬ 
tion. By the early 1860s, the world was saturated with Japanese 
products. Fans, vases, kimonos, lacquer cabinets, folding screens,

jewelry, and tea services were common items in most fashionable 
Western homes. The French were especially taken by Japanese 
culture, and their infatuation was called Japonisme, a term also 
used by the British and Americans. The most popular display at 
the 1867 Universal Exposition in Paris was the Japanese pavilion. 
Especially intriguing for artists were Japanese prints, works that 
first arrived in France as packing material for fragile objects but 
that were being collected by the late 1850s by the artists in 
Manet’s circle, who found them visually fascinating. 

As can be seen in Plum Estate , Kameido (fig. 25.13) by Ando 
Hiroshige (1797-1858), Japanese image making was quite foreign 
to a Western way of seeing. Forms are flat with sharp contours, 
while space is compressed, the foreground pressed up against the 
viewer’s nose, the background pulled right into the foreground 
space. There is no transition between near and far. Just the con¬ 
cept of situating a viewer in a tree from which to see the main 
activity miniaturized in the distance would have been radical to 
the eye of a Western artist. However, the flat contours, abrupt 
cropping, and spatial contraction of Japanese prints certainly 
influenced Degas and Manet, although in a far from obvious 
manner and never approaching direct copying. 


Impressionism: A Different Form of Realism 

The label “Impressionism” was coined by a hostile conservative 
critic in 1874 when reviewing the first exhibition of an artists’ col¬ 
laborative called the Societe Anonyme des Artistes (best translated 
as “Artists, Inc.”). We now refer to that show as the first 
Impressionist exhibition (there would be eight altogether between 
1874 and 1886). Like the general public, the writer found the 
paintings so sketchy that he felt they were just impressions, not 
finished paintings. Actually, the word impression had already 
been applied to the Realism of Manet and Degas. It appears in the 
title of an oil by Claude Monet of the harbor at Le Havre, which 
he exhibited in the first Impressionist exhibition and called 
Impression , Sunrise (see fig. 25.15) and Monet used the term on 
occasion when explaining his ideas on art to friends. (See Primary 
Source , page 872.) 

Impressionism shares with the Realism of Manet and Degas a 
sketchy unfinished look, a feeling of the moment, and a desire to 
appear modern. It also presents its subjects matter-of-factly. 
Many scholars even apply the term Impressionism to the work of 
Manet and Degas, in part to distinguish their Realism from the 
earthy, rural Realism of Courbet and Millet and to indicate how 
Impressionism often shares with them a sense of the urbane and 
the modern. Like Manet and Degas, the Impressionists were 
interested in recording the transformations occurring in French 
society, especially the leisure activities of the nouveau riche. While 
they, too, painted city scenes and genre, they focused more on the 
evolution of the sleepy rural villages surrounding Paris into 
bustling suburbs containing factories, commercial wharves, and 
railroad trestles, on the one hand, and restaurants, regattas, and 
boating for Parisian weekenders on the other. Rather than the fig¬ 
ure, the Impressionists focused more on landscape and cityscape, 
and instead of constructing their compositions in the studio using 
models, they worked empirically, outdoors, where they recorded 
the landscape and weather conditions that they witnessed as an 
evanescent moment. They painted not so much objects as the 
colored light that reflected off them. In effect, they painted what 
they saw, not what they knew. 

CLAUDE MONET The leader in developing Impressionism was 
Claude Monet (1840-1926), who was raised in Le Havre in 
Normandy. He studied with an accomplished local landscape 
painter, Eugene Boudin (1824-1898), who worked outdoors. But 
in order to get financial support from his grocer father, Monet was 
forced to study in Paris, and chose the academically minded but 
liberal painter Charles Gleyre. In the latters studio he met 
Auguste Renoir, who along with the much older Camille Pissarro 
would form the core of the Impressionists. In the early 1860s, 
Monet was forced to serve in the army in Algeria, and like 
Delacroix before him (see page 847), he experienced intense light 
and color that were foreign to the cloud-covered temperate 
Normandy coast. Throughout the 1860s, Monet and his friends 
painted the landscape surrounding Paris, meeting Corot and the 
Barbizon artists, who further encouraged their working outdoors

OURCE 


Lila Cabot Perry (1848?-1933) 



From “Reminiscences of Claude Monet from 1889 
to 1909” 

Perry was an American expatriate painter working in France in an 
Impressionist vein. Monet did not publicly theorize about art , and 
Perry’s statement gives us one of the best insights into his ideas. 



H e never took any pupils, but he would have made a most inspir¬ 
ing master if he had been willing to teach. I remember his once 
saying to me: 

"When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have 


before you—a tree, a house, a field, or whatever. Merely think, here 
is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yel¬ 
low, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact color and shape, 
until it gives your own naive impression of the scene before you.”... 

He held that the first real look at the motif was likely to be the 
truest and most unprejudiced one, and said that the first painting 
should cover as much of the canvas a possible, no matter how 
roughly, so as to determine at the outset the tonality of the whole. ... 

Monet s philosophy of painting was to paint what you really see, 
not what you think you ought to see; not the object isolated as in a 
test tube, but the object enveloped in sunlight and atmosphere, with 
the blue dome of Heaven reflected in the shadows.

directly from nature. For Monet and his colleagues, however, 
these plein-air (outdoor) paintings were not small studies but 
large finished products. Painting rapidly with bold brushwork, 
they sought to capture light (and the color it carried) as it bounced 
off objects. Unlike Manet, who added oil to his store-bought 
paints to make them unctuous, Monet added none or very little, 
leaving them chalky and allowing color to supersede the plastic¬ 
ity of the paint. Nor did he varnish his finished oils, which would 
diminish their color. Monet s extensive use of primary and sec¬ 
ondary colors, the principal hues on the traditional color wheel, 
was in part influenced by recent scientific research about color 
that demonstrated that the intensity of complementary colors 
(e.g., blue and orange, red and green, and yellow and violet) is 


increased when they are placed next to one another. (See Materials 
and Techniques , page 874.) 

We can see the effectiveness of Monet s palette in On the Bank 
of the Seine , Bennecourt (fig. 25.14), painted in 1868 in a village not 
unlike the many Seine and Oise river locations that Parisians took 
the train to on summer weekends and where the more affluent 
built impressive villas alongside rural cottages. The artist works 
with glaring sun-drenched whites and bright blues and greens 
accented with touches of red and yellow. Objects in shadow, such 
as leaves and grass, retain color and do not go black. Browns are 
not muddy but a light-filled tan. Monet maintains the strength 
of his colors by keeping the imagery close to the picture plane, 
not allowing it to suggest depth. As with Manet, there is no

chiaroscuro to model forms. The tree foliage is a two-dimensional 
silhouette, while the blue sky behind is equally flat. The reflection 
of the house on the water runs up and down the picture plane, 
reinforcing the two-dimensionality of the broad smears of light 
and dark blue in the river just below. The solid blue sky is virtu¬ 
ally the same shade as the darker blue in the water, a correlation 
that momentarily pulls the sky to the foreground. The only motif 
that suggests depth is the rowboat running diagonally back in 
perspective. Also asserting the surface of the canvas is Monet s 
bold, variegated brushwork, which changes character from one 
object to the next and gives the picture a shimmering quality that 
suggests we are witnessing a split second in time. 

Equally important, contemporaries realized the brushwork 
represented the unstable, rapidly changing qualities of modern life. 
These pictures looked nothing like previous landscapes; they lacked 
the Classical look of Claude Lorrain, the Baroque conventions of 
the Dutch landscape painters and their earthy palette, and the 
emotional constructions of the Romantics. Their very appearance 


was considered modern, as was their subject matter. We can safely 
assume that the fashionably dressed woman (Monet s wife) is 
meant to represent a vacationing Parisian who has been boating. 

If in a work like On the Bank Monet painted with a range of 
colors, he was also capable of restricting his palette, as in 
Impression , Sunrise (fig. 25.15) of 1872, the work that spawned the 
name of the Impressionist movement. In this fog-shrouded view 
of the harbor at Le Havre in the early morning, we see Monet 
basically using only two colors, the complements blue and 
orange. Blue prevails, defining water and ships with their tall 
masts, while orange is restricted to the rising sun, the fiery sky, 
and reflections on the water. Instead of a symphony of color, we 
now get a single powerful note of orange playing off the blue 
ground. Monet titled the picture Impression instead of naming it 
after the port because, as he himself said, “it really couldn’t pass 
for a view of Le Havre.” Sunrises and sunsets were popular 
themes with artists and were prevalent at the Salons, but they 
were usually dramatic Romantic events set in a landscape or over

MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


Impressionist Color Theory 


I mpressionism was more than just the result of a Realist premise 
based on spontaneously and empirically capturing color and light on 
canvas. Scientific discoveries, technical developments, and mundane 
practicalities also went into the evolution of the style. One of these 
was the development of the theory of color by chemist Michel-Eugene 
Chevreul (1 786-1 889) that appeared in his 1 839 book The Principles 
of Harmony and Contrast of Colors. Chevreul worked in the dyeing 
department of the tapestry workshop of Les Gobelins in Paris, and he 
noticed the intensity of a color was determined not just by the color 
itself but also by its relationship to a neighboring color. Primary col¬ 
ors (red, yellow, and blue) and secondary colors (green, orange, and 
violet), which were made by combining two primaries, became 
stronger when placed next to one another, a relationship he called 
simultaneous contrast. (Tertiary colors combine two secondaries.) 
Value contrast, placing a light hue next to a dark one, also affected the 
power of a color. The greatest intensity came from the juxtaposition 
of complements—red and green, blue and orange, purple and yellow- 
colors opposite one another on the traditional color wheel. Place a 
pure green next to a pure red and the red becomes redder and the 
green greener, the energy of each color escalating to the point where 
they seem to vibrate and “pop.” 

Eugene Delacroix was probably the first artist influenced by 
Chevreul’s theories, although he had intuitively developed similar 
ideas earlier and placed small marks of strong contrasting colors next 
to one another (see page 847). However, the Impressionists were the 
first to work principally with primary and secondary color, though their 
palette was hardly restricted to just these hues. To maintain color 
intensity, the Impressionists began working on a primed surface that 
was light, instead of the traditional somber brown or brownish-red 


ground. Camille Corot pioneered a lighter primed canvas when he 
started using silver, which helped harmonize his tight palette of 
greens, silvers, and blues. It is unlikely that any of the Impressionists 
read Chevreul. But by the 1 860s, his theories were common knowl¬ 
edge among many artists interested in color, and in 1 867 they were 
repeated in Charles Blanc’s The Grammar of Painting and Engraving, 
along with a discussion of Delacroix’s use of simultaneous contrast.

the sea. It is tempting to see Monet satirizing this Romantic nos¬ 
talgic imagery in his picture, which eulogizes not so much the 
glory of nature but rather the dynamic rhythms of a large, com¬ 
mercial port. 

Monets quest in the 1860s and 1870s to capture the dramatic 
changes brought on by industrialization naturally took him to the 
great urban center of Paris. Here he pictured such modern icons as 
the Boulevard des Capucines, one of the new Haussmann avenues 
located near the Opera and lined with fashionable apartment 
buildings and shops, and the Gare Saint-Lazare train shed. In 
1876-77, Monet made ten paintings of the shed recording the 
hustle and bustle of travelers, workmen, and trains (fig. 25.16). It 
is as though one painting alone was not enough to take in the 
complexity of energy and activity beneath the glass-covered shed 
(for a discussion of these train sheds, see page 898), and each view 
represents a fragment of the constant flux of people, machines, 
and equipment. Again, we see Monets variegated brushwork 
creating a blurry, pulsating world, in which we can make out a 
workman, passengers, and trains, and on the ground the shadow 
of the ironwork frame above. In the background, we see a railway 
trestle (the setting for one of Manet s most famous paintings), 


and beyond, the new grand apartment buildings lining a 
Haussmann boulevard. Monet s haze of color and brushwork 
softens everything, giving the steel of the tracks, locomotive, 
columns, and grid of glass roof almost the same ethereal, transi¬ 
tory quality as the charming, blue-shaded puffs of smoke floating 
upward. The harsh, impersonal, geometric qualities of modernity 
dissolve in a flood of light and color that virtually transforms this 
smoke-filled scene of stifling pollution, heat, and noise into a 
visual paradise. 

AUGUSTE RENOIR After meeting and befriending Monet in 
Gleyres studio, Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) also developed an 
Impressionist style employing bright color, bold paint handling, 
and modern subjects. Often working beside Monet, Renoir 
painted landscapes. But he was attracted to the figurative tradition 
as well, and his career straddles the two genres. 

Among his best-known genre paintings is Luncheon of the 
Boating Party (fig. 25.17) of 1881. The picture is set in the 
Restaurant Fournaise on an island in the Seine at Chatou, a small 
village 9 miles (14 km) from Paris’s Gare Saint-Lazare. Chatou 
was especially popular with boaters, and restaurants like this

catered to Parisians. In the background, on the river, we can just 
make out sailboats, a rowboat, and a commercial barge. We also 
get a glimpse of a train bridge. 

The restaurant party consists of urban types, with the excep¬ 
tion of Alphonese Fournaise, the restaurant owners son, who 
leans against the railing, his muscular biceps the result of hauling 
rental boats into the water. Renoir carefully observes his figures’ 
attire, allowing us to identify each type. The top-hatted man, for 
example, appears to be more conservative and moneyed (the 
model was a collector) than the younger men wearing straw boat¬ 
ing caps—the models were Renoir’s friends. Renoir even presents 
a range of boating caps, from a citified version worn by the seated 
figure on the lower right, to a country version on the man on the 
upper right, to an old-fashioned mariner’s cap popular some 20 
years earlier, worn by the man to the left of the top-hatted gentle¬ 
man. The colorful sun-drenched scene of suburban leisure is 
pleasurable and relaxed, its sensuality enhanced by the lavish 
spread on the table and the gloriously lush brushwork of the 
tablecloth. The picture has the momentary quality we associate 
with Realism, achieved in part by the flickering, feathery brush- 
work and the asymmetrical composition that runs off the right 
side of the canvas, the picture being cropped and fragmented like 
Degass The Orchestra of the Paris Opera. 

Luncheon of the Boating Party was made shortly before Renoir 
abandoned Impressionism. Renoir, like several of his colleagues, 
began to believe the critics’ claim that the Realists could not draw 


and that their art lacked the timeless, monumental, and enduring 
qualities found in the great art of the past. In Luncheon of the 
Boating Party , Renoir began to model his figures and even give 
distinctive contours to his objects and figures. As we shall see, 
avant-garde artists in the 1880s would return to many values we 
associate with Classical art. 

CAMILLE PISSARRO Pissarro (1830-1903) was the elder 
statesman of the Impressionists. A decade older than the others, 
he came to Paris in 1855 from his native St. Thomas in the 
Caribbean. During the 1860s, he sought out Corot (see page 
847), who advised him, and he also studied the landscapes of 
Courbet and Charles Daubigny, a famous Barbizon-style artist, 
who worked outdoors and was especially known for painting 
landscape from a boat. As much as Pissarro was committed to 
landscape, he was also dedicated to developing a radical modern 
art, and by the late 1860s he had arrived at a style that like Monet’s 
was empirical, spontaneous, and used bright color. Unlike Manet, 
Monet, Degas, and Renoir, he never considered himself a Parisian, 
and instead lived in the surrounding countryside, which was 
becoming suburban. While he occasionally painted factories and 
trains, he was a social anarchist who was dedicated to the people. 
Peasants and farms, not city dwellers and suburban pleasures, 
were his preferred subject matter. When in Paris, he socialized 
with his fellow artists at the Cafe Guerbois, and not only 
mentored the younger artists but also served as the arbitrator 


876 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 










for Artists, Inc., of which he was a member, participating in all 
eight exhibitions. 

Pissarro was a cautious, intellectual, and deliberate painter, 
who, like Monet in the 1860s, worked outdoors, where he devel¬ 
oped a colorful palette and bold paint handling that captured 
weather conditions and a sense of fleeting imagery. His composi¬ 
tions were often extremely complex, as seen in Climbing Path , 
UHermitage , Pointoise (fig. 25.18) of 1875, set in Pontoise, a sub¬ 
urb of Paris. Here, in a light-speckled landscape, he places a dense 
flat screen of trees in front of a deep view back to a village. This 
peek into the distance is contrasted by the path to the right, which 
seems to rise up the picture plane rather than recede. While the 
tree trunks, leaves, and rocks are painted with broad brushwork 
and bold sweeps of a palette knife that render them as flat, almost 
abstract objects, the distant houses are constructed in perspective, 
as dense three-dimensional cubic forms whose solidity contrasts 
with the flatness of the foreground. While reflecting a Barbizon- 
style love of nature and rural life, Pissarro simultaneously empha¬ 
sized the abstract qualities of picture making, playing flat off 
solid, straight geometric line off unstructured organic forms, or a 
deep view through flat trees off a trail that rises up the picture 
plane. As we shall see, Pissarros complex, highly structured 
compositions would have an enormous impact on fellow 
Impressionist Paul Cezanne, who in turn influenced Pablo 
Picasso and Cubism. 


MANET AND IMPRESSIONISM The landscape styles of 
Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro resembled one another the most 
from the late 1860s to the mid-1870s. However, what is called the 
first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 was not designed to pro¬ 
mote a particular style or artistic movement, although most of the 
36 artists could be described as painterly and often used bright 
color, many of them working en plein air. Rather, the exhibition 
was meant to provide an alternative to the annual Salons. Degas, 
who participated in most of the exhibitions and was one of the 
most vociferous in promoting them, repeatedly disclaimed being 
an Impressionist. His lack of emphasis on color and light certainly 
separates him from the core group. Manet never exhibited with 
the Impressionists, holding out for Salon recognition and accept¬ 
ance into the academy. By the early 1870s, however, he had 
adopted Impressionist color, and in 1873 was painting outdoors 
next to Monet in Argenteuil, just outside of Paris, although his 
paint application remained unctuous and his colors were never 
quite as intense. 

We can see this more colorful palette in his last great Realist 
masterpiece, A Bar at the Folies-Bergere (fig. 25.19), of 1881-82. 
Typical of Manet, the picture is rich in ideas and filled with refer¬ 
ences and hidden meanings, qualities generally not found in 
Realism or Impressionism. Manet has painted a second-floor bar, 
overlooking the main floor below, above which we can see the 
legs of a woman on a trapeze entering the picture in the upper left

corner. Most of the image, however, occurs in a mirror, a flat 
surface, like a painting, that presents an illusion. The illusion 
reflected behind the barmaid is that modern life is gay and festive. 
We see the densely packed sparkling interior of the dance hall that 
virtually symbolized Parisian nightlife at the time. But the bar¬ 
maid, who is real, not a reflection, looks out at us with a sad blank 
expression, suggesting alienation, the reality of contemporary 
urban life. She, too, appears in the mirror, although her image is 
distorted, as she leans slightly forward and appears active and 
engaged. The mirror reveals that she has been approached by a 
dapper top-hatted gentleman, supposedly intent on buying the 
sensual drink and fruit at the bar. Some historians suggest he is 
propositioning the barmaid, citing evidence that some barmaids 
were also prostitutes and that they were as much an attraction of 
the Folies-Bergere as the entertainment and general conviviality. 
This theory would certainly account for the distortion of the 
barmaid in the mirror, suggesting she has two identities or roles. 
Regardless of the interpretation, this quiet interaction, removed 
from the festivity in the mirror, reflects the reality of modern life— 
anonymous, arbitrary encounters and urban alienation. The pic¬ 
ture also seems to comment on the materialism pervading contem¬ 
porary values. The Folies-Bergere was very expensive, catering to 
the well-to-do, and the remarkable still life on the bar captures the 
lavish richness of the music hall. But despite the illusion of gaiety 
in the mirror, an emptiness and sadness fills the picture, evoking 
the inability of money to buy meaningful happiness. But Manet’s 
pictures are often elaborate puzzles, which generally defy a secure 
reading, remaining open to wide and controversial interpretation. 

BERTHE MORISOT Berthe Morisot (1841-1895) was a key fig¬ 
ure in the Impressionist circle. Born into a comfortable Paris fam¬ 
ily, she and her sister Edna took up painting seriously in the late 


1850s. Women were not permitted to attend the Ecole des Beaux- 
Arts, but the sisters studied independently with minor but sup¬ 
portive and knowledgeable artists. When they gravitated toward 
landscape in the early 1860s, they sought out Corot, who, struck 
by the quality of their work, met with them often, even giving 
them one of his paintings to study. Both Morisots had Corot-like 
landscapes accepted at the Salon of 1864, and Berthe had a figure 
painting accepted the following year. Edna married in 1869 and 
stopped painting, but Berthe continued her artistic career. 

As a woman, Morisot could not go to the Cafe Guerbois. She 
nonetheless became an intimate of and even a favorite within the 
avant-garde circle, socializing with Manet, Degas, and other 
Realists at dinners and salons —weekly evening receptions at 
someone’s home, such as the one that Manet’s mother hosted. She 
developed a close friendship with Manet, posing for him in seven 
paintings and eventually marrying his brother. Morisot’s brush- 
work became looser and her palette brighter. She made landscape 
and figure paintings, depicting the modern leisure activities of the 
city, suburbs, and the seashore. Her figures are generally women 
and children, the models most readily available to her. While her 
women are fashionably dressed, they are not pretty, frivolous, and 
mindless; rather, they are meditative and thoughtful, sophisti¬ 
cated, and in control of their image. They are never presented as 
appendages to men (unlike in Renoirs Luncheon of the Boating 
Party). We sense Morisot defining a womans world, one that is as 
valid and meaningful as a man’s. 

Morisot’s pictures are virtually a catalogue of a well-to-do 
woman’s activities: gathering flowers, taking tea, child-rearing, 
reading, sewing, and vacationing in the suburbs and by the sea. 
But undoubtedly what impressed Morisot’s avant-garde col¬ 
leagues was her brilliant technique and finesse: Her bold brush- 
work magically defined figures and objects while creating an

abstract tapestry of paint across the surface of the canvas, a deft 
balancing act that even Manet had to admire. (The hanging 
committee for her memorial exhibition at the Durand-Ruel 
gallery in 1894 consisted of Monet, Degas, and Renoir.) We 
can see her painterly brilliance in Summer's Day (The Lake in the 
Bois de Boulogne) (fig. 25.20), which presents the classic Realist/ 
Impressionist theme of a leisure activity taking place at a trendy 
venue. Typical of Morisot, the fashionably dressed figures do 
not interact, but instead are deep in thought, or perhaps are 
even regarding the scene like a flaneur , which was then generally 
considered the prerogative of a man, not a woman. While the 
palette is closer to Manets and Corots than to Monets, the 
scene is a summers day with light flickering off objects. Morisot 
enhances the spontaneity created with her brushmarks by using 
the sort of asymmetrical, cropped composition first developed 
by Degas. 

MARY CASSATT Like Morisot, Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) 
approached Impressionism from a womans perspective, her 
Realism reflecting the social concerns developing within the 
womens movement of her time. Cassatt was an American. She 
trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia, 
where her wealthy family moved from Pittsburg, in part to sup¬ 
port her career as an artist, a most unusual attitude for the time. 
In 1866, she went to Paris and studied with the renowned acade¬ 
mician Jean-Leon Gerome. She also studied in Parma and Rome 
before returning to Paris in 1874, where she spent the remainder 
of her life. In Paris, she befriended Degas and abandoned her 
academic style for Realism. Invited by Degas, she participated in 
the fourth Impressionist exhibition in 1879. Now, she displayed a 
bright palette, strong brushwork that hugged the surface, and the 
compositional devices of asymmetry and cropping. 

Like Degas and Manet, Cassatt was a figure painter, and her 
most famous themes from the late 1870s include women in loges 
at the opera, a subject also treated by Renoir and Degas. She also 
painted women at home: reading, visiting, taking tea, sewing, or 
bathing an infant. Like Morisot, she presents the modern sophis¬ 
ticated woman in dress, manners, and leisure activities. In the 
1880s, she abandoned her loge theme and focused increasingly on 
domestic scenes, especially of women and children. 

Scholars often attribute Cassatt s subject matter to the restric¬ 
tions she faced as a female: As a respectable woman, she could 
not go unattended to the same places as her male counterparts. 
But more at issue was her belief in the importance of women in 
society, even if this importance was largely restricted to the home. 
Her views coincided with developments then occurring in the 
womens movement. In 1878, the International Congress of 
Womens Rights was held in Paris, and at the top of its agenda was 
the need for better education for women, which would mean free 
and compulsory education through secondary school; France 
enacted this as law in the 1880s. Education would not only allow 
women to become professionals but also to better manage their 
homes and families. The congress also focused on the important 
role that women played in nurturing children, advocating that

mothers should nurse and care for their offspring rather than 
hiring wet nurses. This position reflects the increased importance 
sociologists placed on the care of children in general in the 1870s, 
which in part stemmed from a concern about the high infant mor¬ 
tality rate in Europe, especially in France. The path to a healthier 
society and nation, many argued, began in the home and was in 
the hands of the mother who nurtured her own children, both 
physically and emotionally, including attending to hygiene. 

Cassatt s many domestic scenes of mothers tending their chil¬ 
dren, such as The Child's Bath (fig. 25.21) of 1891-92, came out of 
this context. The pitcher and basin may seem quaint and old-fash¬ 
ioned to us today (only America had widespread indoor plumb¬ 
ing at this point), but regular bathing was a modern phenomenon 
for late nineteenth-century Paris, when people generally bathed 
only once a week. Not only is the picture about health, but also 
about intense emotional and physical involvement, as is reflected 
in the sensual yet tender manner with which the mother touches 
the child.

The picture contains all the ingredients we associate with 
Realism—the fashionable bourgeois decor and dress, the bright 
colors, and the sense of spontaneity in the brushwork and the 
skewed composition with its high viewpoint. The style of the pic¬ 
ture reflects Cassatt s intense attraction to Japanese prints at this 
point in her career, an interest that is reflected in the overhead 
viewpoint as well as in the boldness of her forms and contours. 
Cassatt was also influenced by Renaissance art. Her palette has a 
chalky softness resembling tempera, and the strong line-defining 
contours have the same crispness as is found in fifteenth-century 
Italian painting. Many of Cassatt s presentations of a mother and 
child resemble Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child, 
an allusion that sanctifies the important role of women in creating 
a better society. But it also reflects the direction that Realism took 
after 1880, as many artists, as we saw in Renoirs Luncheon of the 
Boating Party , began to make a more monumental art that recalled 
the Classical art of the past. 

MONET IN THE 1 890S By the time the last Impressionist 
exhibition took place in 1886, any cohesiveness the core group 
had possessed was long gone, replaced by new concerns and 
styles. Manets death in 1883 symbolically marks the death of the 
Realist movement that began with Courbet in the 1840s. Monet, 


however, would live well into the twentieth century and, while 
never abandoning the Realistic premise for his art and his com¬ 
mitment to Impressionism, he succeeded in making paintings that 
were among the most abstract of their day At the same time, they 
became increasingly dreamlike, visionary and poetic. 

In the early 1890s, Monet began working more regularly in a 
series format, painting the same subject over and over, as he first 
did in the Gare Saint-Lazare series. His motifs included wheat- 
stacks, Rouen Cathedral, and a line of poplar trees. The stack 
paintings came first, and he painted 30 of them, beginning in 1890. 
His goal was to show the same subject at different times of day 
and year, and under different weather conditions, believing life is 
not fixed but in continual flux. Working in a series format meant 
that the composition remained largely the same from one picture 
to the next. Again and again Monet painted a two-dimensional 
triangular wheatstack (occasionally he painted two) superim¬ 
posed on top of a field in the foreground, with a line of trees, 
farmhouses, and distant hills at the horizon, and with the sky 
above. With compositional matters out of the way Monet 
concentrated on color, his first love, which he changed from 
one painting to the next, theoretically to capture changing 
atmospheric and light conditions but also simply to give himself 
freer rein to improvise. 


880 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 









In Wheatstack , Sun in the Mist (fig. 25.22) of 1891, Monet used 
basically two complementary colors, orange and blue, in the 
haystack, pitting them against each other to make the stack 
vibrate. The remainder of the image is constructed with primary 
and secondary colors, similarly placed alongside one another, 
causing the entire scene to pulsate. Monet s flickering brushwork, 
now uniform streaks of varying length and direction, increases the 
shimmering effect and gives his wheatstacks a dreamy, haunting 
quality. Like the English landscapists Constable and Turner, Monet 
theoretically focused on capturing atmospheric effects, although 
it can be argued that because of his interest in color he was not as 
dedicated to transforming paint into atmosphere. He heavily 
reworked the Wheatstack canvases in his studio, suggesting that 
he was not solely dedicated to painting empirically. Critic Gustave 
Geffroy, in the introduction to the catalogue that accompanied 
the presentation of the Wheatstack at the Durand-Ruel gallery in 
Paris in 1891, strongly implied that the series is about experience 
and not seeing—that the paintings are about Monet s emotional 
reaction to the stacks and to nature. Geffroy gave the images a 
poetic reading, describing the stacks in one painting as "glow[ing] 
like heaps of gems,” and in another as "hearth fires.” By the 
1880s, images of wheatstacks by French painters populated the 
Salons, the stacks an emblem of the nation s agricultural abundance, 
and Monet may have thought of the stacks similarly. Scholars 
have noted that his stacks sometimes echo the silhouetted shape 
of farmers 5 cottages lining the distant field, Monet thereby draw¬ 
ing a parallel between the two and paying homage to the farmers 
whose labor provides for the nation s food. Regardless of any 
such underlying messages, however, Monets Wheatstack paint¬ 
ings seem more imaginary than realistic. Despite his claims to the 
contrary, Monet had moved well beyond the empiricism of 1870s 
Impressionism to create poetic, visionary images that paralleled 
the dreamlike fantasy worlds then being created by the Symbolist 
avant-garde, whom we will meet in the next chapter. 

BRITISH REALISM 

Realism took a very different form across the Channel, although 
the word itself was never applied to the art there. In Britain, 
Positivism produced a detailed naturalism, an intense truth to 
nature, and an interest in social types. There the Industrial 
Revolution had an almost 100-year head start over France. 
Industrialization and urbanization accounted for the poverty and 
other social ills so familiar to us today from the serialized novels 
of Charles Dickens (1812-1870), which were typically set in a 
cruel, corrupt metropolis suffocated by grime and soot. 
Materialism and greed were rampant. Cheap, ugly mass-produced 
objects replaced the highly refined handmade products that the 
aristocracy and upper class had once demanded. No longer were 
workers highly trained artisans with pride in their work but 
human machines suffering the drudgery of dawn-to-dusk mind¬ 
less labor to turn out inferior consumer items with which they 
had no personal identity. It was precisely these conditions that 


gave rise to the most radical of socialist organizations, the 
Chartists, and gave new energy to Christian socialism, the bibli¬ 
cally based belief in community service and in the renunciation or 
sharing of personal wealth. It was also these conditions that the 
German political philosopher Karl Marx (1818-1883) and social¬ 
ist Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) addressed in their Communist 
Manifesto , published in 1848 in England, where they were then 
living and working. It was artist, educator, writer, art critic, and 
environmentalist John Ruskin (1819-1900), however, who took 
the lead in attempting to arrest this decline into industrial hell. 
After Queen Victoria, he ranks as one of the greatest forces in the 
Victorian era, his influence extending well beyond Great Britain 
to mold American taste as well, beginning with the publication 
of the first of his four volumes of Modern Painters in 1843, and 
continuing with his Seven Lamps o f Architecture after 1851. 

Among Ruskin s most prominent beliefs was the need for con¬ 
temporary society to aspire to a new spirituality and moral pride, 
which required adherence to truth and identification with what he 
considered the divinity of nature. He advocated art education for 
all social classes, for the working-class producer as well as the 
bourgeois consumer. He believed art was a necessity, not a luxury, 
for it molded people s lives and moral values—great art made 
great people. And by art Ruskin meant not only painting, sculp¬ 
ture, and architecture but also the decorative arts, all of which had 
to be as handcrafted, beautiful, and sincere as they had been in the 
Middle Ages. 

Ruskin s emphasis on nature and religion marks the beginning 
of the nineteenth-century search for a simpler life, one that 
rejected the advances of urbanization and industrialization. As 
we've seen, Rosa Bonheur and George Sand were at virtually the 
same moment advocating a return to a "primitive” world—the 
countryside. For Ruskin, this purer primitive world could be 
found either in the spirituality of nature or medieval Christianity. 
By the end of the century, escape from the modern world and the 
search for the primitive would become dominant themes. 

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 

Ruskin championed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a secret 
society started in September 1848 by three students at the Royal 
Academy School: William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and 
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who was the leader and spokesperson. 
The PRB, as they initially signed their paintings, denounced the 
art of the Royal Academy and most painting since early Raphael. 
They found the work decadent in that it clouded truth and fact 
with a muddy chiaroscuro and placed a premium on such artificial 
formal qualities as elegant contours or pleasing compositional pat¬ 
terning. Like Ruskin, the PRB abhorred bourgeois materialism and 
taste. Their heroes were the fifteenth-century Italian and Nether¬ 
landish primitives, such as Fra Angelico (see page 531) and Jan van 
Eyck (see pages 479-85 ), whose work they perceived as simpler, 
more direct, and hence sincere in its attempt to represent nature. 
They also considered this work more spiritual and moral because 
it was identified with the intensely religious Late Gothic period.

WILLIAM HOLMAN HUNT The most religious of the Pre- 
Raphaelite Brotherhood was William Holman Hunt (1827-1910), 
who came from a poor working-class family. His work is charac¬ 
terized by a combination of Victorian moral didacticism and 
intense naturalism. The Awakening Conscience (fig. 25.23) of 
1853-54 was inspired by a passage in Dickenss David Copper field 
where David s friend, the simple fisherman Peggoty, goes search¬ 
ing for his beloved Emily who has run off with an amoral dandy 
Hunt tells the tale of one of the thousands of poor women appear¬ 
ing in the Realist literature of the period who perceived prostitu¬ 
tion as their only hope of improvement even though it would 
inevitably lead to ruin. While sitting on her lover s lap and singing 
a song, a kept woman becomes aware of the lyrics, thinks of her 
family and suddenly abhors her sinful situation, from which she 
must immediately escape. Hunt renders the room, cluttered with 
the shiny vulgar products of crass consumerism, with a micro¬ 
scopic attention to detail worthy of Jan van Eyck, whose 
“Arnolfini Portrait” (see fig. 14.14) entered the collection of the 
National Gallery in London in 1842. In his review of the 1854 
annual academy exhibition, Ruskin described the objects in 
Hunt s painting as having a “terrible lustre” and a “fatal newness” 
that reflected “the moral evil of the age.” As in the “ Arnolfini 
Portrait” every object seems to function symbolically The cat 
chasing the bird under the table reflects the kept womans posi¬ 
tion, and the clock approaching high noon denotes that the time 
left for decisive action is quickly expiring. The background mir¬ 
ror reflects an open window—redemption—since beyond we see 
the purity beauty and spirituality of nature, gloriously bathed 
in a bright divine light. Biblical warnings appear throughout 
the image, and on the bottom of the frame is a moralistic passage 
from Proverbs. The density of objects and figures in the painting

eliminates the compositional patterning and pleasing aesthetic 
contours that the Pre-Raphaelites disdained. 

JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS The PRB was initially best known 
for biblical and literary pictures. While the subjects were drawn 
from a spiritual past, the themes were selected for their parallels 
with contemporary London and served as moral lessons. This is 
clear in Christ in the Carpenter's Shop( fig. 25.24), by John Everett 
Millais (1829-1896) and shown at the Royal Academy in 1850, 
where it was poorly received. The painting shows Jesus as a young 
boy in his stepfather’s shop being comforted by his parents over 
a wound to his hand. Virtually every object in the room is a dis¬ 
guised symbol prefiguring the future role of Jesus as Savior. His 
cut palm anticipates the stigmata, his cousin John the Baptist car¬ 
ries a bowl that prefigures his calling, the flock beyond the door 
represents the congregation, and the tools on the wall, including 
the ladder, announce the Crucifixion. Millais’s attention to realis¬ 
tic detail was perhaps the most intense of any member of the 
Pre-Raphaelites. To paint this picture, he went to a carpenter’s 
shop to make studies of wood shavings and the musculature of a 
woodworker. He painted the sheep from severed heads. 

The picture is more than an uncanny re-creation of a genre 
scene set during Jesus’ boyhood. Rather, it is a Ruskinian political 
and social statement supporting quality workmanship and labor, 
spirituality being an attribute of hard-working artisans. Further 
identifying Christ with the working class, Millais depicts dirt 
beneath Jesus’ fingernails, just as Courbet did with his stone- 
breakers, a detail that especially offended viewers. 


WILLIAM MORRIS About 1856, two young painters befriended 
the Pre-Raphaelites: William Morris (1834-1896) and Edward 
Burne-Jones (1833-1898). Morris would dabble in architecture 
and become a renowned poet, but his true calling was implement¬ 
ing Ruskin’s theories about replacing shoddy mass-produced 
products with beautifully designed handcrafted ones that, as in 
the Middle Ages, workers would take pride in producing. After 
collaborating in 1859 with architects, painters, and designers in 
the PRB and Ruskin’s circle to design and furnish his own house, 
Morris in partnership with some of these same artists opened a 
company in 1865, which came to be called Morris & Co. It man¬ 
ufactured beautifully crafted fabrics, wallpaper, tapestries, car¬ 
pets, tiles, furniture, and stained glass, with Morris himself 
designing most of the wallpaper and fabrics, a talent that trans¬ 
lated easily into the many book designs he also undertook. 

The palette and motifs of the Morris company products were 
organic and Gothic, creating an aura of nature and spirituality. 
This aesthetic is apparent in the dining room (fig. 25.25) that 
Morris designed in 1867 for a new applied-arts museum called the 
South Kensington Museum, known today as the Victoria & 
Albert Museum. The gold-ground panels at the top of the wain¬ 
scoting were painted principally by Morris’s good friend Burne- 
Jones and represent the 12 months of the year, and thus the cycle 
of life. Because of the gold ground, they evoke the Early 
Renaissance (see fig. 13.22) and its intense spirituality. Morris’s 
wallpaper, laboriously handprinted from wood blocks, is a flat 
abstract pattern based on an olive branch. The simple chest, dec¬ 
orated by Burne-Jones and also recalling the early Renaissance

with its gold ground, is by the architect Philip Webb, who also 
designed the ceiling and the frieze above the wallpaper, abstract 
patterns largely based on botanical sources. As important as the 
handcrafting was the principle of truth to materials that Ruskin 
had advocated—that a material cannot be disguised as something 
it is not. Prefabricated plaster moldings, brackets, and decoration, 
then especially popular, were not allowed. In-vogue wallpaper 
mimicking the lush fabric that before the 1840s covered the walls 
of upper-class homes was condemned. Inferior wood could no 
longer be painted to resemble the grain of expensive wood. 
Morris and his collaborators ’ impact on the applied arts was far- 
reaching, launching what is known as the Arts and Crafts 
Movement, which soon spread to the United States. 


The Aesthetic Movement: 

Personal Psychology and Repressed Eroticism 

While William Morris kept the moral and spiritual program of 
Ruskin alive with his Arts and Crafts Movement, the Pre- 
Raphaelite group had dissolved by 1860. Millais, for example, 
turned to anecdotal genre painting, and not only became a mem¬ 
ber of the Royal Academy but in 1896, the year of his death, its 
president. Rossetti, who had not been very productive in the 
1850s, meanwhile gravitated toward a visionary, medieval-style 
art that expressed his own personal psychology, not social moral¬ 
ity. Burne-Jones followed Rossetti down this path toward a 
visionary art that eventually developed into what is known as the 
Aesthetic Movement. Running through the paintings of both 
Rossetti and Burne-Jones is an undercurrent of repressed sexual¬ 
ity a reflection of the strict moral code of Victorian Britain that 
outlawed even the discussion of sex. 


DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI Today, Dante Gabriel Rossetti 
(1828-1882) is best known and most appreciated for his post- 
Pre-Raphaelite work. As the initial leader and spokesperson for 
the PRB, his shift away from its principles was significant for it 
anticipated the direction art was going to take in the closing 
decades of the century as Realism waned, to be replaced by a per¬ 
sonal devotion to portraying strong emotions and imagination. 
The direct catalyst for this attitude was the poet Algernon 
Charles Swinburne (1837-1909), who in turn was influenced in 
the 1850s by the French critic Theophile Gautier. Gautier was a 
leading advocate of “art for art s sake,” a theory maintaining that 
art s function was first and foremost to be beautiful, to appeal to 
the senses, and not to project moral values or tell stories. Rossetti 
came under Swinburne s spell, and the two men even shared a 
house in Chelsea after Rossettis wife died in 1862. 

This new aesthetic can be seen in Rossetti s Proserpine (fig. 
25.26) of 1874. The model was Jane Burden, William Morriss 
wife, with whom Rossetti was passionately in love, a sentiment 
she reciprocated. The artist presents her as Proserpine, the god¬ 
dess abducted by Pluto, god of the underworld. Pluto forced her 
to eat six pomegranate seeds, which condemned her to spend six 
months of the year in Hades, the other half being spent above

James Abbott McNeill 
Whistler (1834-1903) 

From The Gentle Art of Making Enemies 

The Gentle Art of Making Enemies (1893) is Whistler's autobiography. 

A s music is the poetry of sound, so is painting the poetry of sight, 
and the subject matter has nothing to do with harmony of sound 
or of color. 

The great musicians knew this. Beethoven and the rest wrote 


music—simply music; symphony in this key, concerto or sonata in 
that. ... 



This is pure music as distinguished from airs—commonplace and 
vulgar in themselves, but interesting from their associations, as for 
instance, “Yankee Doodle. ...” 

Art should be independent of all clap-trap—should stand alone, 
and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this 
with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriot¬ 
ism, and the like. All these have no kind of concern with it, and that 
is why I insist on calling my works “arrangement” and “harmonies.”

ground with her mother Ceres, goddess of the earth. Rossetti 
himself provides us with a succinct description of the painting: 

Proserpine is represented in a gloomy corridor of her palace, 
with the fatal fruit in her hand. As she passes, a gleam strikes on 
the wall behind her from some inlet suddenly opened, and 
admitting for a moment the sight of the upper world; and 
she glances furtively toward it, immersed in thought. The 
incense-burner stands beside her as the attribute of a goddess. 
The ivy branch in the background may be taken as a symbol of 
clinging memory. 

Rossetti was in part attracted to Burden because of her classic Pre- 
Raphaelite looks, including her long, elegant neck and hands, and 
rich, flowing raven hair. Here, she wears a sumptuous 
Renaissance robe, the folds picking up the curvilinear rhythm of 
the ivy and her hair, face, neck, back, and hands. She stands 
behind a table that recalls the ubiquitous ledge found in Italian 
Renaissance portraiture. 

By presenting Burden as Proserpine, Rossetti was expressing 
how he perceived her as trapped in a cold, loveless marriage with 
Morris. The picture is ultimately about the artist s own feelings of 
longing, as expressed in the line from his poem in the upper right, 
“And still some heart until some soul doth pine. ” Rossetti, also a 
serious poet and a translator of the works of his hero Dante, has 
in effect created a pictorial poem, dominated by the slow sensu¬ 
ous curvilinear surface patterning, the lush deeply saturated robe, 
and rich, lustrous, flowing hair. While Burden is presented as 
chaste (their relationship was apparently never consummated) 
and spiritual, dripping with Renaissance piety, she is also sensual 
and alluring. Instead of Realism, reality, and social issues, Rossetti 
has presented us with a torpid dream world filled with his own 
sexual yearning. 

JAMES ABBOTT MCNEILL WHISTLER By the late 1870s, 
Rossetti was depressive, paranoid, and reclusive, and rarely exhib¬ 
ited. His friend Burne-Jones thus became the standard-bearer for 
the Aesthetic Movement and showed at the Grosvenor Gallery, a 
new space dedicated to this new art. But the most famous and 
notorious proponent of Aestheticism is the American painter 


James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903). Raised in New 
England and Russia, Whistler studied with Charles Gleyre in 
Paris, where he lived from 1855 to 1859. He met Monet, 
befriended Courbet, and made his mark as a Realist, painting 
scenes of contemporary life that captured the underbelly of the 
city. After moving to London in 1859 (he never returned to 
America), he continued to spend long periods in Paris, maintain¬ 
ing his Parisian connections and friendships as well as submitting 
work to the Salons. He knew Gautier through Courbet and 
Manet, and in London befriended Swinburne. 

By 1863, Whistler had abandoned French Realism to pursue 
Aestheticism, an example of which is his Symphony in White No. 
I: The White Girl , a title only applied later and probably inspired 
by Gautiers poem “Symphony in White Major.” Whistler sub¬ 
mitted the picture to the 1863 Salon des Refuses , where it hung not 
far from Manets The Luncheon on the Grass. Like Gautiers 
poem, which is a complex interfacing of different white visions, 
the painting orchestrates a range of whites, soft yellows, and reds 
in a full-length portrait of the artist s mistress Jo, who is dressed 
in white against a largely white ground. While Gautier and 
Swinburne influenced Whistler conceptually, visually the artist 
came under the spell of Japonisme, an influence more clearly 
stated in Symphony in White No. II: The Little White Girl (fig. 
25.27) of 1864. Here, Jo leans on the mantel of Whistlers London 
home, surrounded by a Japanese blue-and-white vase, fan, and a 
spray of cherry blossom, often identified with Japan. At one level, 
the painting is a sensual display of abstract color and shapes. 
Using thin, delicate brushstrokes and almost transparent layers of 
paint, Whistler orchestrates a graceful symphony of whites, 
yellows, reds, pinks, and blues across the picture plane. He plays 
the softness of his paint and such forms as Jo s dress against the 
rectangular linearity of the mantel, mirror, and reflected picture 
frames. The flowers entering the composition on the right are 
another delicate touch, a Japanese compositional device used ear¬ 
lier by Degas to create fragmentation and spontaneity but here to 
make the petals seem to float magically. 

The painting was conceived as a tribute to Ingres, composi- 
tionally echoing his Portrait of Madame Ines Moitessier (see fig. 
24.14) and acknowledging the great Neoclassicists ability to cre¬ 
ate perfect beauty. But in psychology it is closer to Rossetti s

Proserpine , for Whistler depicts a similarly dreamy, meditative, 
yet sensual mistress with long flowing hair. Jo s reflection levitates 
ghostlike in the mirror, an image that inspired Swinburne to write 
a poem, which Whistler affixed to the back of the canvas. 

In the following decade, Whistler s work became increasingly 
abstract, as in Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket 
(fig. 25.28) of about 1875. He exhibited the painting in 1877 at the 
Grosvenor Gallery with seven other ethereal, thinly painted 
blue-gray nocturnes (a musical term meaning “night scenes”) of 
the Thames River, all meant to support his art-for-art s-sake 
position. The Falling Rocket is by far the most abstract, to the 
point that the aging Ruskin accused Whistler of “throwing a pot 
of paint in the publics face,” for which Whistler sued him for 
slander. The painting is a picture of fireworks at Cremorne 
Gardens, a popular nightspot in the Chelsea section of London. 
Although based on real events, the work was nonetheless con¬ 
cocted in the studio according to more subjective dictates. As 
Whistler explained at the Ruskin trial, “It is an artistic arrange¬ 
ment. That is why I call it a nocturne. ” As suggested by his titles, 
which include words such as symphony and sonata as well as 


nocturne, Whistler considered painting visual music, declaring it, 
in essence, abstract. (See Primary Source , page 885.) Without the 
words “The Falling Rocket” in the title, we would be hard- 
pressed to describe an actual subject; we would be left savoring 
Whistler s abstract display of orange and yellow sprinkles lazily 
drifting down over a gray-blue-brown ground of gossamer-thin 
brushstrokes. As in Symphony in White No. 77, Whistler s surface 
has a delicate Japanese sensitivity, so refined that shapes and 
marks barely exist as one color bleeds through the haze of another. 
With his Grosvenor Gallery exhibition, Whistler moved art into a 
subjective, nonempirical realm. Unwittingly, he was presenting a 
preview of the art of the next two decades, as we shall see in the 
next chapter. 


REALISM IN AMERICA 

The ripple effect of the European revolutions of 1848 did not 
reach America, although it did produce waves of new immigrants. 
A more significant defining benchmark for the United States is 
the Civil War, which had a devastating physical, psychological, 
and economic impact on the nation. The Garden of Eden was rav¬ 
aged. After the war, this metaphor for the country disappeared, 
displaced by the “Gilded Age,” a term coined by Mark Twain and 
his coauthor for an 1871 book of the same name describing a new 
page in American history largely dominated by the robber 
barons, one that brought about tremendous wealth and ostenta¬ 
tion. Twains robber barons were the American speculators, 
manufacturers, industrialists, real-estate investors, and railway, 
coal, and iron magnates who made vast fortunes, often exploiting 
workers. Their new wealth transformed them into an American 
aristocracy with aspirations to all things European. The robber 
barons and their families traveled to Europe, brought back 
European furniture and art, and built European-style villas and 
chateaux. The result was a nostalgia by many for a more innocent, 
lost past, one perceived as pre-industrial. 

The period is also defined by continued westward expansion, 
fulfilling what the nation saw as its God-given Manifest Destiny 
to overrun the North American continent. Survey teams mapped 
the new territories, and the Transcontinental Railroad, connecting 
East and West, was completed in 1869. By 1890, the government 
had subdued the Native American nations, either by containment in 
restricted territories or by violent annihilation. It honored Native 
Americans in 1913 by putting an Indian warrior, in headdress and 
Greek profile, on the American nickel. The reverse side portrayed 
the buffalo, also made “extinct” by westward expansion. 


Scientific Realism: Thomas Eakins 

Thomas Eakins (1844-1916), a Philadelphian, was among the ear¬ 
liest and most powerful Realist painters in America. His scenes of 
the modern world included not only middle-class leisure activities 
and the popular sports and pastimes of post-Civil War America 
but also surgery clinics portraying surgeons as modern heroes

and highlighting new scientific techniques such as anesthesia and 
antiseptic surgery. Eakins even brought a scientific approach to 
his Realism, which made it quite different from the Realism of 
Manet and Degas that he had witnessed while studying with a 
renowned academician in Paris in the late 1860s. 

Among Eakins s first works upon returning to Philadelphia 
was a series of sculling pictures, such as Max Schmitt in a Single 
Scull (also called The Champion Single Sculls) (fig. 25.29), an 1871 
painting that reflects the rising popularity of the sport and pres¬ 
ents Max Schmitt, the winner of a championship race on the 
Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, as a hero of modern life. While 
the picture looks like a plein-air painting, what we see is not a 
quickly recorded Impressionist moment but a painstakingly 
reconstructed event. Eakins s paintings are grounded in intense 
scientific inquiry designed to ensure the accuracy of his Realism. 
He made numerous perspective studies of the skulls and oars, 
which result in the river receding with breathtaking mathematical 
precision, firmly locking the boats in space. He studied light 
effects and anatomy, and, as a teacher at the Pennsylvania 
Academy of Art, outraged his colleagues and suffered public 
scorn by having his students, including women, work from the 
nude model, rather than imitate plaster casts of Classical figures. 
His quest for Realism drove him to record minute details, includ¬ 
ing a steamboat and landscape behind the distant bridges, details 


beyond the reach of normal vision. (Shortly afterward he would 
begin using photographs in addition to drawings as preliminary 
studies.) The second bridge is an emblem of modernity, for it is 
a railroad bridge, on which we can just make out a train and 
its puffs of smoke. Eakins s Realism even extends to modern 
psychology, for Schmitt s isolation in the broad expanse of the 
river seems a form of alienation, as does his expression of unfamil¬ 
iarity as he twists to squint at us, not Eakins, who is in the scull 
behind Schmitt. 

Iconic Imagery: Winslow Homer 

Winslow Homer (1836-1910) was in Paris about the same time as 
Eakins. He was already disposed toward painting the modern 
world, for he began his career in 1857 as a magazine illustrator, 
recording the latest fashions and social activities and later cover¬ 
ing the Civil War. He was in Paris in 1866-67, where he saw the 
work of Courbet, Millet, and Manet, but he was too early to expe¬ 
rience the full impact of Impressionism. Upon returning to New 
York, he painted outdoor scenes of the middle class engaged in 
contemporary leisure activities, such as playing croquet, 
swimming at the newest New Jersey shore resorts, and taking 
horseback tours in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, 
diversions now accessible by train. 


888 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 














An Artist's Reputation and Changes in 
Art-Historical Methodology 


A change in the methodology of art history can sometimes affect 
scholars’ attitudes toward artists, sometimes resurrecting figures 
who had once been renowned but had gradually disappeared from the 
history books. A case in point is the American painter John Singer 
Sargent (1 856-1 925). In his day, he was one of the most famous and 
financially successful artists. He can even be considered the quintes¬ 
sential American artist at that time, for he lived and worked in Europe 
and his art appeared to embrace the European values that so many 
nouveau riche Americans aspired to emulate. 

Sargent was born and raised in Florence, studied at the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts in Paris, and by 1 879 was winning medals at the Salons. In 
part due to the encouragement of novelist Henry James, he moved 
permanently to London in 1 886. He made his first professional trip to 
America in 1 887, and immediately became the portraitist to high 
society, painting William Henry Vanderbilt of New York and Isabella 
Stewart Gardner of Boston, among others. By 1 892, he was the most 
fashionable portraitist in London and perhaps on the Continent as 
well. Sargent’s success was in part based on the luxuriousness of his 
imagery—expensive fabrics and furnishings—reinforced by his dra¬ 
matic sensual brushwork. 

Sargent was a proponent of the avant-garde. He befriended Claude 
Monet and acquired his paintings as well as Manet’s. His own work 
reflects the painterly bravura of Manet, and like Manet he admired 
Velazquez. He also made numerous Impressionist landscapes and 
urban views, often in watercolor. Ironically, Sargent fell into oblivion 
because of the Modernism that evolved in the twentieth century. His 
consummate handling of paint may have had the abstract qualities 
that the Modernists admired, but his work was perceived as conserva¬ 
tive. It failed to offer anything new. Worse yet, his avant-garde brush- 
work was carefully packaged in the old-fashioned formulas of society 
portraiture. 

Sargent’s reevaluation began in the 1 950s, with a renewed appreci¬ 
ation of the paint handling in his Impressionist watercolors. In suc¬ 
ceeding decades his reputation gradually inched its way up as 
Modernism was replaced by Postmodernism and its broader values. 
(See Chapter 30.) Representational art became fashionable again, and 
art historians began to appreciate art for the way in which it reflected 
the spirit of its age. Sargent’s portraiture was now perceived as the 
embodiment of Victorian and Edwardian society and of the Gilded Age. 

For example, gender studies, which began appearing in the 1 970s, 
looked at his daring presentation of women, as can be seen in his 
1 897 portrayal of New York socialite Edith Stokes in Mr. and Mrs. I. N. 
Phelps Stokes. Instead of giving us a demure and feminine woman, 
Sargent presents a boldly aggressive Mrs. Stokes, who represents the 
“New Woman” who emerged in the 1 890s (see page 904). In a period 
when the women’s movement was fiercely advocating equal rights, 
many women were asserting their independence and challenging 
conventional gender roles. This New Woman was independent and 
rebelled against the conventional respectability of the Victorian era 
that sheltered women in domesticity. She went out in public; she was

educated; and she was athletic, spirited, and flaunted her sexual 
appeal. Not only did she wear comfortable clothes, she even wore 
men’s attire, or a woman’s shirtwaist based on a man’s shirt. Instead 
of self-sacrifice, she sought self-fulfillment. Sargent presents Edith 
Stokes as just such a woman, even having her upstage her husband. 
The placement of her hat over her husband’s crotch was especially 
controversial. For its time, this was a radical presentation of a woman 
and a reflection not only of the sitter’s personality and identification 
with women’s issues, but also of Sargent’s willingness to buck portrait 
conventions and societal expectations.

25.30 Winslow Homer, Snap the Whip. 1872. Oil on canvas, 22 1 /x 36 1 / (56.5 x 92.7 cm). The Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio 


Rather than portraying a world in flux, however, Homer cre¬ 
ated iconic symbolic images of American life and issues, as had 
Millet of the French peasant. We can see this emblematic approach 
in his Snap the Whip({\g. 25.30) of 1872. At first glance, this visual 
record of a children’s game appears to be an Americanization of 
Impressionism, for the image is a sun-filled scene rendered with 
fairly strong color and flashy passages of brushwork. But 
Homers color is not as intense as the Impressionists’, nor his 
brushwork as loose. The picture is not about color and light and 
empirically capturing a specific moment: This image is frozen. 
The figures are carefully outlined, modeled, and monumental, 
their solidity reinforced by the geometry of the one-room school- 
house and the bold backdrop of the mountain, which parallels the 
direction of the boys’ movement. The barefoot children in their 
plain country clothes, like the one-room schoolhouse behind 
them, are emblems of simplicity and wholesomeness, their youth 
projecting innocence and hope for a recently reunified country 
The game itself is symbolic of union, since the chain of boys is 
only as strong as its weakest link. At a time when the nation was 
staggering under the weight of the disillusionment brought on by 
the Civil War and the turmoil of rampant industrialization, Snap 
the Wf hip embodied the country’s lost innocence and was a nostal¬ 
gic celebration of values that were quickly fading into memory 


PHOTOGRAPHY: A MECHANICAL 
MEDIUM FOR MASS-PRODUCED ART 

In 1839, photography was commercially introduced almost 
simultaneously in both France and Britain. As a mechanical 
process that would eventually lend itself to mass production and 
popular culture, it was a perfect fit with the Industrial Revolution 
and seems a natural consequence of it. It was also a perfect tool for 
the Positivist era, for initially it was largely perceived as a record¬ 
ing device for cataloguing, documenting, and supporting scientific 
inquiry It had the appearance of being objective, paralleling the 
matter-of-fact presentation of much Realism and Impressionism. 

The potential for photography had existed since antiquity in 
the form of the camera ohscura , a box with a small hole in one 
end that allowed the entrance of light, projecting an upside-down 
image of an object outside to be cast on the inside wall at the 
opposite end of the box. An artist could then trace the projected 
image. We know that Vermeer and Canaletto, for example, 
occasionally used a camera ohscura for their paintings. However, 
the problem that remained was how to fix the image mechanically, 
that is, how to give it permanence without the intervention 
of drawing. 


890 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






First Innovations 

In the early eighteenth century, silver salts were discovered to be 
light-sensitive, but it was not until 1826 that the French inventor 
Joseph-Nicephore Niepce (1765-1833) made the first photographic 
image, a blurry view out of his window that required an eight-hour 
exposure time. He teamed up with artist Louis-Jacques-Mande 
Daguerre (1787-1851), who, after discovering the light-sensitive 
properties of silver iodide and the use of mercury fumes to fix a 
silver iodide-coated copper plate, unveiled the daguerreotype in 
1838. The French government acquired the process and offered it 
free to the rest of the world, excepting Britain, with whom the 
French were in fierce economic competition. The invention repre¬ 
sented both a nationalistic and imperialistic triumph, for it enabled 
the French to document not only the monuments of France but 
of its colonies as well, especially Egypt. And it was also viewed as 
a “Republican” medium since, unlike painting and sculpture, it 
was affordable, making portraits available to all social classes. 

Meanwhile, in Britain, William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877) 
announced in 1839 that he could fix an image on paper, rather 
than on metal or glass, and in 1841 he took out a patent for the 
new negative-positive photograph he called a calotype, a salted 
paper print. Unlike the daguerreotype, which resulted in a single 
image, the calotype generated endless positive paper prints from 
one paper negative. 

Both the daguerreotype and calotype were displaced in the 
early 1850s by the simultaneous invention in France and Britain 
of the wet-collodion process. This technique used a very sensitive 
emulsion, collodion (gun-cotton dissolved in alcohol ether), that 
cut exposure time to under a second and produced a sharp, easily 
reproducible negative. However, the process was cumbersome, 
for it required the photographic glass plate to be both prepared 
and processed as soon as it had been used. This meant keeping the 
plate chemically wet at all times and transporting a portable dark¬ 
room. At about the same time, Louis-Desire Blanquart-Evrard 
(1802-1872) developed the albumen print, which used salted egg 
white on paper, creating a smooth, more refined surface that 
revealed greater detail with less graininess. For the next 30 to 40 
years, photographers used wet-collodion plates for recording 
images and then printed them on albumen paper. 

In 1846, Talbot published a photographically illustrated book, 
The Pencil of Nature, the title being a reference to light, “Nature s 
pencil,” which “draws” on an emulsion-coated surface. (The 
word photograph is from the Greek words for “light” and “draw¬ 
ing.”) Here, Talbot framed many of the basic issues that would 
surround photography well into the future. He not only saw the 
medium as a recording process capable of scientifically document¬ 
ing the world, but also as an interpretative vehicle that would 
allow for new ways of perceiving and understanding reality, thus 
permitting artistic vision. Well into the twentieth century, this 
latter insight did not prevent the general public from viewing 
photography primarily as a tool for recording truths as well as a 
symbol of the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution and its 
accompanying social ills. 


Recording the World 

By the 1850s, the most prevalent use of photography was for 
recording the world: people, sights, and objects. These pictures 
were generally viewed as fact, which is ironic since, as we shall 
see, photographers could manipulate images in various ways, 
including the selection of motifs and objects to be included in, or 
excluded from, a photograph. 

PORTRAITURE Americans especially took to photography, 
which the artist and inventor Samuel Morse (1791-1872) brought 
back to New York from France just weeks after the French govern¬ 
ment made it available in 1839. Soon every American city had pho¬ 
tography studios offering daguerreotype portraits, and this form 
of photograph remained popular in the United States long after it 
had been superseded in Europe by the albumen print. Americans 
especially loved its wealth of details and simple factuality, which 
was reinforced by the blunt presentation of the sitter, posed against 
a plain background that did not detract from his or her physical 
presence. The daguerreotype could record the most minute details 
clearly, a clarity that holds up even under a magnifying glass. (Do 
the same with an albumen print and you get a blur.)

count the hairs on Browns head, trace the wrinkles on his face 
and hands, and even inspect the thread holding his buttons on. 
Unlike most of their European counterparts, American por¬ 
traitists encouraged their clients to project a personality for their 
photographs. The photographer here captured Brown, in a stern, 
determined, and almost confrontational pose, taking a vow and 
holding what historians believe to be a flag for the Subterranean 
Pass Way, the name he gave to an “underground railroad” he was 
planning for transporting runaway slaves north. Washington had 
the most successful studio in Hartford, Connecticut, but Brown 
undoubtedly went to him as a fellow abolitionist, which the por¬ 
traitist, a free African American and political activist, most likely 
was. But convinced that blacks would never achieve equality dur¬ 
ing his lifetime, Washington sold his business shortly before the 
Civil War and emigrated to the Republic of Liberia, meaning “lib¬ 
erty,” founded in West Africa as a sanctuary for former slaves, 
who started arriving there in 1822. 

In Europe, the largest portrait studio in the 1850s and 1860s 
belonged to Adolphe-Eugene Disderi, whose business was head¬ 
quartered in Paris but had branches in Madrid and London. His 
enormous staff churned out formulaic portraits using the same 
props and settings, often a Classical column and a pompous swag of 
drapery. These same props are found in royal portraiture (see fig. 
21.10), and were now used to fulfill the upwardly mobile social 


aspirations of Disderi s bourgeois patrons. In 1854, he increased 
the popularity of photographs when he invented the carte-de- 
visite, a 2 1 /x 4" visiting card with the visitor s portrait, which by 
1859 were widely collected, a phenomenon called “cardomania. ” 

Among the most celebrated early portraitists of the era was 
the Parisian Gaspard-Felix Tournachon (1820-1910), known sim¬ 
ply as Nadar. He began his career as a journalist and caricaturist 
and may have taken up photography as an aid in making the lith¬ 
ographic caricatures for his planned compendium of the 1,000 
most prominent personalities of the day, which he called Le 
Pantheon Nadar. He began cashing in on the public infatuation 
with celebrities by mass-producing albumen prints of the famous, 
in particular writers, actors, performers, and artists of bohemian 
Paris. His skill as a caricaturist proved invaluable in setting up his 
shots, enabling him to create incisive portraits that captured the 
essence of his sitter s mystique. 

We can see this skill in Nadars 1870s portrait of the painter 
Edouard Manet (fig. 25.32). Although of bourgeois origin, Manet 
is not presented as moneyed. The sitter may wear expensive 
clothes and be seated in a lavish chair, but there is no pretentious 
Classical column or billowing drapery Instead the emphasis is on 
Manet s forceful personality. He has turned his chair around in a 
businesslike, if not argumentative manner, grasping the top with 
his right hand, and with a gesture of confidence placing the other 
hand on his hip. His meticulously trimmed beard and mustache 
and dapper clothes confirm his renown as a dandy Nadar, espe¬ 
cially noted for his lighting, has backlit Manet s head, making the 
entire figure seem to thrust forward and reinforcing the intensity 
of the painter s stare. 

VIEWS Along with portraits, views dominated photography for 
they allowed people to travel the world without leaving their 
living room. Fulfilling the French government s vision of docu¬ 
menting its African conquests, Maxime Du Camp (1822-1894), a 
Parisian journalist, photographed the French territories in Africa 
and the Middle East, and in 1852 published 125 images in his 
book Egypt , Nubia , Palestine and Syria. More popular than such 
albums, which could be quite expensive, were stereocards, which 
by the 1860s were as prevalent as musical compact disks are today 
Stereocards are side-by-side photographs of the same image taken 
by a camera with two lenses, replicating human binocular vision. 
When put into a special viewer, the twin flat pictures appear as a 
single three-dimensional image. To accommodate the tremendous 
demand for these images, distributing companies stocked as many 
as 300,000 different stereocards at one time. The quality of the 
rapidly reproduced prints was generally low, a problem com¬ 
pounded by their 2-by-5-inch size, although larger versions also 
existed. An awestruck world now slid the cards into their viewers 
and saw in three dimensions not only the dramatic changes occur¬ 
ring in Europe, such as new buildings, parks, and monuments, but 
such exotic climes as China, India, and Africa. 

Of course, these same stereocards were available in the United 
States, which was an enormous market. American photographers 
were mostly preoccupied with documenting their own nation. A

large contingent of them, like their fellow painters, specialized in 
landscape, traveling west, often with survey teams, to record the 
sublime wilderness that symbolized the nation. One of the first 
and most famous of this group is Carleton Watkins (1829-1916), 
who beginning in 1861 made hundreds of glass stereographic 
views of Yosemite along with some 1,000 18-by-22-inch albumen 
prints. Despite his strong commercial sense, Watkins thought of 
his work as art, not documentation. Originally from Oneonta, 
New York, he went west to San Francisco with the Gold Rush in 
1851, eventually making daguerreotype portraits and photo¬ 
graphically documenting land for surveys. Hearing about the 
visual wonders of Yosemite, he took off in 1861 to photograph 
this awesome, primeval landscape. In order to capture the vast 
scale of the land, he felt it was necessary to make large prints, and 
consequently he developed a mammoth camera that used large 
glass plates. He then set off in a covered wagon with a ton of 
equipment, which included wet-glass plates and a darkroom to 
process them immediately after they were exposed. 

The results, as seen in Yosemite Valley from the Best General View 
(fig. 25.33), made on a second trip to Yosemite in 1865-66, were so 
breathtaking that when shown to President Lincoln they helped 
convince him to preserve Yosemite as a park. Watkins captures the 
sublime scale of the American wilderness, the mountain peaks dra¬ 
matically dwarfing Yosemite Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in 
America. Watkins produced a lush image by working up extremely 
rich textures in the developing process and a sense of drama by 


creating powerful value contrasts and a composition of forceful 
diagonals descending from both right and left. To keep the sky 
from going a monotonous white, which would have happened had 
he used the proper exposure for the land, Watkins employed a sec¬ 
ond negative to add clouds. If we take into consideration the degree 
of manipulation of the camera, including depth of focus, aperture 
time, the decisions that went into selecting and framing the com¬ 
position, and the numerous tools used in the darkroom, we can 
understand why Watkins declared his photographs art, even exhibit¬ 
ing them in 1862 at the prestigious Goupil Gallery in New York. 

DOCUMENTATION Photography was also put in the service of 
categorizing the social types so central to the Positivist mentality. 
Perhaps the best example of this use of photography is Adolphe 
Smiths Street Life in London (1878), initially issued monthly as 
illustrated brochures, much like the physiologies in France. Smith 
was the nom-de-plume for Adolphe Smith Headingley 
(1846-1924), a social activist, who teamed up with photographer 
John Thomson (1837-1921), who also wrote some of the lengthy 
text for each social type. As stated in their introduction, they 
viewed the photograph as an objective tool for validating their 
descriptions: “[We wish to bring] to bear the precision of photog¬ 
raphy in illustration of our subject. The unquestionable accuracy 
of this testimony will enable us to present true types of the 
London Poor and shield us from the accusation of either under¬ 
rating or exaggerating individual peculiarities of appearance. ”

While most of Thomson’s images seem quite objective and 
unbiased, some, like The Crawlers (fig. 25.34), are powerful and 
compassionate, making the viewer sympathize with the plight of 
the poor. Here, a homeless widow minds the child of a working 
mother. The photo appeared in a brochure called The Crawler s, a 
reference to the indigent street dwellers who occasionally got 
enough money to buy tea and then, being too weak to walk, 
crawled to a pub for hot water. 


Reporting the News: Photo journalism 

Early photography also recorded famous events—a forerunner of 
photojournalism. Among the most outstanding examples are 
images of the Civil War, such as A Harvest of Death, Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania, July 1863 (fig. 25.35) by Timothy O’Sullivan (ca. 
1840-1882), who like Watkins became one of the great photogra¬ 
phers of the American West. Before setting off to document the 
Civil War, O’Sullivan began his career as an apprentice to Mathew 
Brady (1823-1896), owner of the most famous photographic 
portrait gallery in America, located in New York. (Abraham 
Lincoln sat for Brady over 30 times and credited Brady’s flattering

1860 albumen print portrait with helping him win that 
Novembers presidential election.) In 1862-63, O’Sullivan signed 
up with the photographic team of Alexander Gardner and con¬ 
tributed 44 images to the album Gardner's Photographic 
Sketchbook of the War (1866). Unlike the banal European photo¬ 
graphic images of the 1854-56 Crimean War, the Civil War 
photographs of O’Sullivan and his colleagues captured the horrific 
devastation wrought by the American conflict, despite the fact 
that the exposure time required by their cameras did not 
permit action pictures. 

In A Harvest of Death , we feel the power of the documentary 
reality of photography, which a painted image can never have. 
We see real people and real death—images of an actual event on 
a definite date, the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863—not a 
fictitious image. Although we know that the war photographers 
often moved objects and bodies for the sake of their pictures, 
there is no evidence to suggest that O’Sullivan did so here. In any 
case he conveys the grim reality of war. The anonymous corpses 
are as lifeless as bales of hay waiting to be collected, hence the 
title. Their dark forms are hauntingly contrasted with the void of 
the overcast sky. The cropped bodies at right and left add to the 
brutality of the scene, so convincingly registered with the gaping 
mouth on the face of the dead soldier in the foreground. The 
living are pushed deep into the background, shrouded in the 
morning mist, as though life during this seemingly endless 
national conflict is itself dissolving into just the barest memory. 

Photography as Art: 

Pictorialism and Combination Printing 

Not all nineteenth-century photographers saw the new medium 
as primarily a tool to document reality. Some viewed it as high art 
and deliberately explored photography’s aesthetic potential, con¬ 
fident it was as valid an art form as painting and sculpture. This 
attitude, which some critics found threatening (see Primary 
Source , page 896), was more prevalent in Europe than in America 
in the first 50 years of photography. Many artists experimented 
with the camera. Degas, for example, made photographs, 
although they had no obvious impact on or relationship to his 
painting, and Eakins used the photograph as he would a prelimi¬ 
nary drawing, employing it to establish his compositions, which 
ultimately do not look photographic. Many painters and sculp¬ 
tors had collections of photographs, especially of models, which 
were used as source material. Courbet in particular is known to 
have used photographs from the 1860s for both his figurative 
paintings and landscapes. Arguments have been made that the 
look of photographs influenced artists, particularly Realists and 
Impressionists, but these claims remain controversial. 

BRITISH PICTORIALISM In London, a group headed by Oscar 
Gustave Rejlander (1813-1875), a former painter who has been 
called “the father of art photography,” and Henry Peach 
Robinson (1830-1901), another former painter who at one time 
was perhaps the most famous photographer in the world, began 


making composite images designed to look like Old Master and 
contemporary paintings. Both artists posed and costumed figures, 
whom they put in staged settings. To make their final photograph, 
they would take numerous photographs, producing multiple 
negatives (Rejlander as many as 30), which they then laboriously 
arranged in what was basically a cut-and-paste assemblage. The 
resulting images were often heavy-handed, far from seamless and 
not at all lifelike. Contemporaries derogatorily referred to them as 
“patchwork quilts. ” Their style is called Pictorialism, because the 
staged images were meant to look like paintings. Despite the fame 
of its principal practitioners, Pictorialist combination printing did 
not remain popular. 

More successful were those Pictorialists who had a personal 
aesthetic vision and instead of using multiple negatives used just 
one, manipulating the camera and printing process to meet their 
needs. Although far less well known during her lifetime, Julia 
Margaret Cameron (1815-1879) is perhaps the most celebrated 
today of the British Pictorialists. Unlike Rejlander and Robinson, 
she did not use combination printing. Her trademark was an 
out-of-focus blurring to make her images seem painterly, as seen 
in Sister Spirits (fig. 25.36) of about 1865. Born in Calcutta and 
settling on the Isle of Wight in 1860 after the death of her

Charles Baudelaire 


(1821-1867) 



“The Modern Public and Photography,” from 
Part 2 of The Salon of 1859 

Baudelaire , now known primarily for his poetry\ was an important art 
critic at midcentury and a powerful advocate for artists painting 
contemporary life. 

I am convinced that the badly applied advances of photography, like 
all purely material progress for that matter, have greatly contributed 
to the impoverishment of French artistic genius. ... Poetry and 
progress are two ambitious men that hate each other, with an instinc¬ 
tive hatred, and when they meet along a pathway one or other must 


give way. If photography is allowed to deputize for art in some of art s 
activities, it will not be long before it has supplanted or corrupted art 
altogether, thanks to the stupidity of the masses, its natural ally. 
Photography must, therefore, return to its true duty, which is that of 
handmaid of the arts and sciences. ... Let photography quickly enrich 
the traveller s album, and restore to his eyes the precision his memory 
may lack; let it adorn the library of the naturalist, magnify microscopic 
insects, even strengthen, with a few facts, the hypotheses of the 
astronomer; let it, in short, be the secretary and record-keeper of 
whomsoever needs absolute material accuracy for professional 
reasons. ... But if once it be allowed to impinge on the sphere of the 
intangible and the imaginary, on anything that has value solely because 
man adds something to it from his soul, then woe betide us!

husband, Cameron soon became an intimate of leading poets and 
scientists, and a thorn in the side of the photography world when 
she challenged the supremacy of crisp, focused imagery. Like 
Rejlander and Robinson, she staged scenes using actors, costumes, 
and sets, and illustrated such literary sources as the Bible, 
Shakespeare, and the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson 
(1809-1892). Stylistically, her images recall artists as diverse as 
Rembrandt and Pietro Perugino (see page 553). 

Sister Spirits reflects the impact of the Pre-Raphaelites and 
Aesthetic Movement, in particular their preference for spiritual 
images set in the Late Gothic or Early Renaissance periods. Her 
women look as though they have stepped out of a Perugino paint¬ 
ing and suggest such saints as Mary and Anne. The two children 
look like angels, and the sleeping baby like the Christ Child. One 
can also view the picture as the Three Ages of Woman, since the 
title suggests that the baby is most likely female. Cameron s 
blurred foreground is more than just a gimmick to give the image 
a painterly touch. It also carries psychological and symbolic 
meaning, for by visually dissolving the flowers and baby, 
Cameron makes the focused women consciously aware of the 
undetermined fate of the sleeping infant. Concern, pensiveness, 
and questioning are registered on the faces, and we sense a spiri¬ 
tual female bonding in this tight grouping of figures, who are 
closed off in the background as the image again goes fuzzy. While 
the photograph has soft sensual elements, it does not present 
women as objects meant for a male viewer, nor as appendages to 
a male world. Instead it reflects a powerful female vision as it 
embraces a female spirituality. 

Cameron was generally criticized not only for her blurry 
images, which were attributed to incompetence, but also for the 
very act of making photographs. As a female photographer in a 
sexist society, she found it difficult getting men to participate in 
her Pictorialist photographs, although they would pose for their 
own portraits. She was criticized for exhibiting her art, which was 
a rare event for respectable Englishwomen in the Victorian era, 


and she was admonished for selling her photographs through a 
major London print dealer—it was deemed inappropriate for 
women to earn money. By redefining camera focus, Cameron 
challenged not only what was becoming the normative approach 
to photographic vision but also a vocation that was specifically 
male. Ironically, by the end of the century, male photographers 
would adopt her vision. 

COMBINATION PRINTING IN FRANCE In France, one 
of the most passionate champions of art photography was 
Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884). Initially a painter, he turned to 
photography and became one of the medium s technical innova¬ 
tors, being the first to use double printing (using two negatives), 
which he used to compensate for the bleaching out of the sky in 
his marine photographs. While he pioneered paper negatives 
and the wet-collodion process, both of which, as discussed, 
allowed for finer images and greater detail, his approach to the 
medium was often quite painterly, focusing on a dramatic contrast 
of dark and light. To accomplish this, he invented processes that 
produced extremely fine gradations of tone and one technique 
that allowed him to develop a print for up to two weeks after 
it was exposed, during which he could manipulate the image. 
He also touched up negatives with a brush to alter their tonality 
and remove objects, and he toned his prints with a solution of 
gold chloride in hydrochloric acid, resulting in a lush violet- 
purple quality. 

These techniques can be seen in Brig on the Water (fig. 25.37) 
of 1856, an especially rich albumen print made from two wet- 
collodion glass negatives, one for the sky, the other for the sea, 
since at the time sky and sea required very different exposure 
times. What makes this image so exceptional is the rich range of 
tones that Le Gray was able to achieve, largely due to his dark¬ 
room technique. This technique allowed him to darken the sides 
of the image to dramatically frame the sea. It also allowed for the 
rich patterning of the dark clouds, which are contrasted with

lighter clouds in the center. And, finally, it allowed Le Gray to 
heighten the reflection of the setting sun on the water at the hori¬ 
zon, and to make light flicker among the waves in the foreground. 
The play of light and dark throughout the image is dramatic and 
the product of Le Gray s technical finesse. The result is a transcen¬ 
dental seascape where the drama of clouds, light, and sea dwarfing 
a lone silhouetted boat seems to embody the elemental forces of 
nature. Not surprisingly, Brig on the Water ranked among the 
most popular photographs of its day, one London dealer even 
claiming it had “800 copies subscribed for in two months.” 

Le Gray is believed to have been the first photographer to 
appear in the graphic-arts section of the Salons. He passionately 
felt photography was art, writing “the future of photography 
does not lie in the cheapness but in the quality of a picture....it is 
my wish that photography rather than falling into the domain of 
an industry or of commerce, might remain in that of an art. ” 


ARCHITECTURE AND 

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 

Iron was another product of the Industrial Revolution, and its 
relationship to architecture was as nebulous as that of photogra¬ 
phy to fine art. Initially in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth 
centuries, iron was used for civil engineering, to build bridges and 
factories. Britain, home of the Industrial Revolution, began mass- 
producing cast iron in 1767 and remained its greatest producer 
through the first half of the nineteenth century It led the way in 
the architectural adaptation of iron, erecting in 1779 the first iron 
bridge, an arched structure spanning the narrow Severn River at 
Coalbrookdale. Soon, the metal was used for the columns in tex¬ 
tile factories and, by 1796-97, for an entire internal structure. 

Revival styles continued to dominate architecture up to the 
closing decades of the nineteenth century but the use of iron,

while quite limited, freed buildings and civic structures from 
historicism because form (design) was now determined by the 
material and by engineering principles, thus setting the stage for 
the advent of modern architecture—not in Britain but in 
Chicago—in the 1880s. The pragmatism of iron construction and 
the blunt presentation of the mediums structural properties 
parallel the pragmatism and realism of the Age of Positivism. 

Ferrovitreous Structures: Train Sheds and 
Exhibition Palaces 

In the early nineteenth century, builders often used cast iron for 
the columns of Gothic-revival churches, and in the 1830s, with 
the rise of railroads, they employed it for train sheds as well. The 
sheds had to span parallel tracks and platforms and be high 
enough to allow steam and smoke to dissipate. The first of these 
sheds, Londons Euston Station (1835-39), spanned 40 feet. The 
grandest was Londons St. Pancras Station (1863-76), the girded 
metal arches of which spanned 263 feet (fig. 25.38) and when 
extended in depth formed the largest undivided enclosed space up 
to that time. The cast-iron skeleton supported a roof of glass. This 
combination of iron and glass is often called ferrovitreous (for 
another example of a ferrovitreous train shed, see the Gare Saint- 
Lazare as represented in Monets 1877 painting of the same title, 
fig. 25.16). Each arch of St. Pancras Station is actually a double 
arch, one on top of the other, tied together with a truss, a reinforc¬ 
ing structure composed of two or more triangles sharing sides. 
Known since Roman times when it was used for wood construc¬ 
tion and hence by all roof and bridge builders, by 1860 the truss 
was ubiquitous in metal structures spanning large spaces. 


As spectacular an engineering feat as a train shed like St. 
Pancras was, it paled in comparison to the new railway bridges, 
which had to cross deep canyons and broad rivers. Train sheds 
were nothing more than small-scale pieces of bridge architecture, 
the arches girded together to whatever depth was needed. The 
regularized repetition of arches is itself symbolic of mass produc¬ 
tion, reflecting the ability of industry to churn out an endless 
supply of the exact same product at a constant rhythm. 

Perhaps the most famous ferrovitreous building of the nine¬ 
teenth century is the Crystal Palace (fig. 25.39), built in London 
in 1851 to house the first great international trade fair, the Great

Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations. The fair was 
designed to showcase the product development, technological 
advances, agricultural improvements, and fine and applied arts of 
the new industrial nations, with Britain expecting to shine as the 
most advanced. The exposition was not just a trade fair but a 
celebration of Western industrialization. Britain’s preeminent 
greenhouse architect, Sir Joseph Paxton (1801-1865), designed the 
building and with engineers erected what is essentially a giant 
greenhouse. While the ferrovitreous materials are the same as in 
Paxton s earlier greenhouses, the form is not, for it resembles an 
English cathedral, with a long, barrel-vaulted center nave, a lower 
barrel-vaulted transept, and stepped-down side aisles. (After the 
exposition closed, the building was dismantled and moved to 
nearby Sydenham, where another transept was added. It was 
destroyed in a fire in 1936.) The building was a cathedral of indus¬ 
try, which had become the new religion. The familiar form and 
human scale of the buildings small component parts, such as 
panes of sheet glass, must have helped put people at ease within 
this looming, visionary, 1,851-foot-long structure—its length 
determined by the year of the exhibition, 1851. 

Historic Eclecticism and Technology 

The Crystal Palace had a strong technological look, perhaps 
because it was conceived as a temporary, nontraditional building 
designed to host an exposition dedicated to technology and 
industry Generally monumental, stately buildings, such as court¬ 
houses, theaters, and parliaments, were not built of iron. Instead 
they were executed in stone and were associational or “represen¬ 
tational,” designed in a revival style that established a lineage to 
the Classical, Gothic, or Renaissance past. We saw, for example, 


how Gamier incorporated elements of the Louvre into the Paris 
Opera in order to link Louis Napoleon to Louis XIV. Iron was 
reserved for industrial buildings, such as train sheds and bridges 
and enormous food markets (Les Halles, Paris, 1850s) and urban 
shopping malls (Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele, Milan, 1865-77). 

BROOKLYN BRIDGE The need to cloak technology in historic 
eclecticism is apparent in what is perhaps the greatest spanning 
structure of the nineteenth century the Brooklyn Bridge (fig. 
25.40), designed by John Roebling (1806-1869) in 1867 and fin¬ 
ished by his son Washington Roebling (1837-1926) in 1883. When 
announced, the bridge was considered a folly; when finished, a 
wonder of the world. Suspension bridges already existed, but on 
a much smaller scale, and no one imagined it possible to dig piers 
in such a deep waterway as New York s East River, to have them 
rise 300 feet above the water, and then to span the vast distance 
from Brooklyn to Manhattan while supporting fives lanes of traf¬ 
fic for railroads, carriages, and pedestrians. To accomplish this 
feat, John Roebling not only used vertical cables attached to the 
main drooping suspension cables, but also wire cables running 
from the top of the piers to regular intervals on the bridge, creat¬ 
ing triangular units that he considered trusses. 

Typical of the taste of the times, the two enormous piers are an 
eclectic combination of revival styles, with Gothic revival prevail¬ 
ing. In the original plan, however, the piers were Egyptian pylons, 
a motif retained in the final version only in the gorge moldings 
where the cables thread the top of the granite structure. As every¬ 
one at the time noted, the piers functioned like enormous Roman 
triumphal arches. The bridge was declared “America s Arch of 
Triumph,” a reference not only to its awesome scale and achieve¬ 
ments but also to America s technological superiority

Sainte-Genevieve, Paris. Designed 1842, built 1842-51 


BIBLIOTHEQUE SAINTE-GENEVIEVE By the 1850s, New 
York excelled at the production of cast-iron facades, where five- 
and six-story buildings, generally used for light manufacturing, 
were entirely sheathed in skins of iron arches and columns resem¬ 
bling stone. The more monumental and nonindustrial the build¬ 
ing, the less likely the overt use of iron. The most innovative use 
of iron in an important civic structure is in Paris, where the 
Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve was designed in 1842 by Henri 
Labrouste (1801-1875). The exterior of the library is designed in 
a Renaissance revival style that evokes Jacopo Sansovino s famous 
Library of San Marco (1536) in Venice and the Medici Bank in 
Milan (ca. 1460). The exterior gives no hint of the radical technol¬ 
ogy displayed within. The main reading room (fig 25.41), located 
on the second floor, consists of two airy barrel vaults, their 
columns and arches made of cast iron (the ceiling is mesh-rein- 
forced plaster). Instead of the Italian Renaissance of the exterior, 
the interior suggests the Gothic, specifically a Romanesque refec¬ 
tory. But to a Parisian, the metal arches would immediately bring 
to mind the new train sheds, suggesting not only modern life but 
also a sense of voyage, which indeed is the function of books. 

Labrouste did not need to use iron in his library: He chose to 
do so for metaphorical and symbolic purposes. In effect, he was 
announcing the importance of technology in fashioning a new 
and better world. This symbolic use of iron even appears in the 
first-floor entrance, where a dense arrangement of fluted square 
Classical columns suggesting an Egyptian hypostyle hall supports 
metal arches resembling modern iron bridges, a reminder to the 
visitor that books and technology are a bridge to the future. 


Announcing the Future: The Eiffel Tower 

The most famous iron structure from the period is the Eiffel 
Tower (fig. 25.42), erected by the French engineer Gustave 


Eiffel (1832-1923) in 1887-89 as an entrance to the 1889 Paris 
International Exposition. To create his tower, Eiffel basically 
appropriated a trussed pylon from the many bridges he had 
already constructed. At 984 feet high, twice the height of any 
other structure then in the world, it dominated the city, and 
because its design was largely determined by its structural 
integrity rather than adherence to a particular architectural style, 
it initially affronted Parisians, who declared it an eyesore. The 
lacework tower was so thin it looked fragile and unstable; Eiffel 
added arches at the base and organic decoration on the two plat¬ 
forms (removed in the 1930s) to make visitors more comfortable 
with his radical, visionary structure. 

As with the Brooklyn Bridge, however, the public, grasping at 
the familiarity of the arches at the base, soon came to view the 
tower as a triumphal arch, one heralding the triumph of French 
technology and industry It also saw the tower as a declaration of 
the triumph of the people: For a pittance, anyone could take the 
elevator to the upper platforms. Here, common citizens could 
look down on the churches and palaces, the bastions of tradition 
and privilege, which the century’s continuous march toward 
democracy had undermined. The Eiffel Tower became a tower of 
the people and a symbol of Paris, if not France as well. More 
important, it pointed to the architecture of the next century, one 
of Modernism that would shed historical references and instead 
allow style to reflect the nature of the new building materials.

Progress and Its Discontents: 
Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, 
and Art Nouveau, 1880-1905 



T he closing decades of the nineteenth century 

presented a cultural dichotomy. On one side were those who 
optimistically reveled in the wealth, luxury, and technological progress 
of the industrialized world. On the other were those who perceived 
these same qualities as signs of decadence, excess, moral turpitude, and a spiritual 


decline. Ther former experienced exuberance and pride, the latter 
despair and anxiety. Depending on ones viewpoint, the period 
was either the Belle Epoque , “the beautiful era,” or the jin de 
siecle , “the end of the century,” immersed in anxiety about 
impending change. Often associated with the fin de siecle is the 
Decadent movement, a literary fashion that started in France in 
the 1880s and focused on exotic, bizarre, self-indulgent characters 
obsessed with leading anti-bourgeois lifestyles of visionary splen¬ 
dor that rejected the rational and the mechanization of modernity. 
The movement spread throughout Europe in the following 
decade. In Britain, it was best represented by the writer Oscar 
Wilde, whose homosexuality, dandified dress, and appreciation 
for the precious and unusual virtually epitomized the movement. 

The end of the century, as well as the 14 years leading up to 
World War I, indeed constituted a period of unprecedented eco¬ 
nomic growth and prosperity, nurtured by some 40 years of peace 
following the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. National consolidation 
was largely complete, with many countries functioning as 
republics. Germany and France joined Britain and Belgium as 
truly industrialized countries, with Germany even leapfrogging 
over Britain, producing twice as much steel by 1914. The United 
States was included as well in this exclusive group. Spurred by

both capitalism and a heated nationalism was a dramatic increase 
in imperialism, which resulted in the carving up of Africa as 
well as parts of Asia and the Pacific islands into fiefdoms to be 
economically exploited. 

The modern era, which began in the eighteenth century, now 
evolved into a new phase called modernity, often labeled the 
“New Industrial Revolution. ” The steam engine was refined and 
improved. Electricity, the telephone, the internal combustion 
engine, gasoline, automobiles, submarines, airplanes, moving pic¬ 
tures, and machines increasingly defined modern life, whose pace 
quickened even as it became, at least for many, more comfortable 
and efficient. In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi sent a wireless signal 
across the Atlantic, further shrinking the globe. 

The late nineteenth century saw a dramatic increase in a sense 
of European superiority. Despite the sharp political divisions aris¬ 
ing from nationalism, Europeans and such European-linked 
countries as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New 
Zealand shared a similar way of life and attitudes. They felt their 
world constituted the “civilized” world, and everything—and 
everyone—else was “backward. ” Enlightenment philosophy and 
science, Europeans believed, had reached a climax, creating the 
most sophisticated and elevated branch of humankind. As never 
before, Europeans became race-conscious, with whites consider¬ 
ing themselves superior. Charles Darwin s theory of evolution, 
set forth in the Origin of Species (1859) and Descent of Man 
(1871), was twisted to reinforce this view of white supremacy. If

life was a struggle that resulted in the “survival of the fittest” 
through “natural selection” of the “most favored races,” then 
clearly, it seemed, advanced Western civilization was the “most 
favored race. ” 

Many cultural anthropologists, however, refused to label any 
society as better than any other, and found tribal societies to be 
just as complex as Western civilization. The mores and values of 
any culture, they argued, were appropriate to its environment and 
circumstances. And then there were Europeans who found tribal 
cultures to be superior; lamenting industrialization and suspicious 
of unchecked progress in the West, they perceived the newly col¬ 
onized, exploited territories in Africa and the Pacific as unspoiled 
utopias, havens from the materialistic evils of modern civilization. 
Continuing the tradition launched by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 
the eighteenth century, they viewed these so-called primitive soci¬ 
eties as still steeped in nature and thus virtuous and pure, as well 
as connected to universal spiritual forces. 

Modernity also resulted in a renewed search for the spiritual 
in the closing decades of the century. Anthropologists demon¬ 
strated that the rituals, practices, and beliefs of Christianity were 
not unique at all, but had parallels in tribal cultures and Eastern 
religions. The strongest expression of this attitude appeared in Sir 
James Frazers (1854-1941) multivolume The Golden Bough , 
which even declared that magic and religion were separated by a 
very fine line. As growing numbers of people fled progress by 
embracing an intense spirituality, they were drawn to orthodox 
Western religions as well as to Eastern-inspired practices such as 


Theosophy and Rosicrucianism. Many were also drawn to ani¬ 
mism and the occult, the period witnessing a dramatic increase in 
the appearance of psychic and spiritual mediums. 

The late nineteenth century also marks the rise of psychology 
The German physiologist Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) transformed 
psychology from a philosophy to a natural science by basing it on 
scientific method, which he detailed in his 1874 Principles of 
Physiological Psychology. Meanwhile, the research of the Russian 
Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) sparked an intense interest in how 
human behavior is conditioned by experience and environment. 
And in Vienna, the neurologist Sigmund Freud began to formu¬ 
late his theories of the unconscious, publishing his Interpretation 
of Dreams in 1900. This interest in the mind and the elemental 
forces driving human responses went well beyond the scientific 
community to permeate popular and high culture, and artists as 
diverse as Auguste Rodin and Edvard Munch increasingly focused 
on the unseen forces residing deep within the mind that produced 
such outward manifestations as sexual urges and anxiety 

Another major influence molding this period was the emer¬ 
gence of the “New Woman”: women bent on changing the 
restrictive laws and conventions of Victorian society The 
womens movement, launched in the second quarter of the nine¬ 
teenth century in both Europe and America, became a powerful 
force in the last quarter, as women organized and forcefully 
demanded political, economic, educational, and social equality. 
By the 1890s, the term “New Woman” had been coined, and the 
mass media, especially in America, developed a visual image to 


904 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 

























describe her: She was tall, athletic, and independent, and she 
rejected the onerous probity of the Victorian era, wearing 
comfortable, masculine-inspired clothing while also flaunting her 
sexuality. This New Woman threatened most Victorian men, who 
viewed her independence as a challenge to their power, preferring 
women to stay at home, uneducated and without financial inde¬ 
pendence. Male artists were no exception, and the castrating, 
dominating femme fatale became a popular theme, a visual expres¬ 
sion of male fears. At the same time, an increasing number of 
women artists presented women from a female viewpoint, one 
that gave them social importance and dignity, as Mary Cassatt and 
Julia Margaret Cameron had done before (see Chapter 25). These 
artists broke with the male tradition of depicting women as sex 
objects or as being defined only by their dependence on men. 

In many respects, progress was the watchword of the late 
nineteenth century, and the force to which artists responded. The 
vast majority rejected it, seeking a spiritual, utopian, or primitive 
alternative. The result was a range of styles or movements, chief 
among them Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, and Art Nouveau. 
Most of the artists built on the brilliant formal innovations of 
Manet and the Impressionists and created work that was more 
abstract than representational. Their art was also highly personal, 
not reflecting a group vision. Consequently many artists, such as 
Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cezanne, cultivated their own dis¬ 
tinctive form of mark making. Often their work was visionary, 
depicting fantasies and dreamworlds, and often it was spiritual, as 
it sought relief from the crass, empty materialism of modernity 
and a more meaningful explanation for existence. Many artists 
found their subject matter in the sanctuary of the Classical, 
medieval, and biblical past, which the Realists had so fiercely 
rejected. Even modern architecture indulged in fantasy and spiri¬ 
tuality. Art Nouveau, for example, succeeded in freeing architec¬ 
ture from the dominance of the eclecticism of revival styles by 
creating buildings that eerily resembled strange but marvelous 
organic forms. At the same time, the great Chicago architects of 
the 1880s and 1890s developed the first glass and steel skyscrapers 
and, in the case of Frank Lloyd Wright, complex houses made up 
of a relentless modern geometry of horizontals and verticals. Still, 
they often invested their modern buildings and houses with a 
powerful spirituality that tied them as much to cosmic forces as 
they did to the constant march of progress. While Realism and 
Impressionism had sought to capture the essence of the modern 
world, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, and Art Nouveau 
largely struggled to escape it and to provide an antidote. 

POST-IMPRESSIONISM 

The early twentieth-century British art critic Roger Fry coined 
the term Post-Impressionism to describe the avant-garde art that 
followed Impressionism, work that became a springboard that 
took art in new directions. Each of the Post-Impressionist 
artists—Paul Cezanne, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, and 
Paul Gauguin—developed a unique style. Still, there are artistic 


conditions that unify the period from 1880 to 1904. The Post- 
Impressionists rejected the empiricist premises of Realism and 
Impressionism in order to create art that was more monumental, 
universal, and even visionary. Post-Impressionists, with the 
exception of Seurat, also rejected a collective way of seeing, which 
we found in Impressionism. Instead, each artist developed a 
personal aesthetic. Like the Impressionists, however, many Post- 
Impressionists continued to mine Japanese art for ideas. They also 
maintained the anti-bourgeois, anti-academic attitude of the 
Impressionists, similarly turning to artists’ cooperatives and 
private galleries to promote their art. 

Paul Cezanne: Toward Abstraction 

Actually, Cezanne (1839-1906) is of the same generation as the 
Impressionists, developing his Post-Impressionism in tandem 
with the rise of that style. Born into a wealthy but socially iso¬ 
lated family in Aix-en-Provence in southern France, he rejected 
studying law and went to Paris to study art in 1861. He enrolled 
at a drawing academy, but was essentially self-taught, copying 
paintings in the Louvre by Delacroix and Courbet, among others. 
From 1864 to 1869, Cezanne submitted intentionally crude, dark, 
intensely worked paintings depicting mysterious, morbid, and 
anonymous orgies, rapes, and murders to the Salon. These works 
were rejected, as the anti-bourgeois, anti-academic Cezanne knew 
they would be. In part, they were meant to shock and disgust the 
jurors. He painted with a palette knife and the dark pigments of 
Courbet, and he was also inspired by the Romantic imagery of 
Delacroix as well as the thematic brazenness of Manet. He even 
painted several Modern Olympias , inspired by Manets Olympia 
(see fig. 25.11), one of which he showed at the first Impressionist 
exhibition in 1874. (He would participate in the first three shows.) 

In 1872, Cezanne left Paris for Pontoise and then nearby 
Auvers at the suggestion of Camille Pissarro (see page 876), who 
was already living there. The older artist became his mentor, and 
they bonded in their desire to make an art that stylistically looked 
modern. He began painting landscapes, occasionally at Pissarro’s 
side. With this steadying influence, Cezanne’s emotionalism 
dissipated, his palette lightened, even becoming colorful, and his 
compositions took on a powerful structural integrity, which had 
been suggested in his earlier work but now blossomed. As he 
would state later in life, he wanted “to make of Impressionism 
something solid, like the art in the museums. ” 

We can see how he achieved this goal in a work from the next 
decade, Mont Sainte-Victoire (fig. 26.1), painted around 1885 to 
1887 in Provence, where the reclusive artist settled in the early 
1880s. Typical of Impressionism, this canvas presents a light-filled 
landscape painted with broad brushstrokes and fairly bright color. 
The picture seems to shimmer at first, then it freezes. Cezanne has 
locked his image into a subtle network of shapes that echo one 
another. The curves and bends of the foreground tree branches 
can be found in the distant mountain and foothills. The diagonal 
lines on the edges of the green pastures reverberate in the houses, 
mountain slopes, and the directionality of the clusters of parallel

dashlike brushstrokes, perhaps best seen in the green pine needles. 
Just as the building to the right of the tree has a solid cubic pres¬ 
ence, combinations of contiguous flat green pastures and ocher 
fields cause blocklike forms to emerge from the earth, before they 
dissolve once again in thin planes of color. A fair number of ver¬ 
tical stresses, often quite minute, are tucked into the landscape 
and play off strong horizontals to suggest an underlying grid. 

Many aspects of the picture can be read in two diametrically 
opposed ways. There is an Impressionistic flicker, but it is a struc¬ 
turally frozen image. The picture is a deep panoramic view, and 
yet it is also flat and compressed, for the distant sky sits on the 
same plane as the foreground tree branches. This conflation is in 
part due to the tapestry of aligned, off-white brushstrokes that 
seem simultaneously to encase the pine needles and be woven into 
the sky. Every brushstroke sits on the surface of the canvas as a 
flat mark asserting the surface; and yet the strokes overlap one 
another, causing a sense of space or depth to exist between them. 
Even line has a dual function, for it can be read as shadow, as on 


the top of the mountain, making depth happen, or it can be seen 
as a flat contour. There is a conflict here between figuration and 
abstraction, for while the picture obviously depicts a real world, 
we are never allowed to forget that we are looking at flat paint, 
lines, and patches of color applied to a flat canvas. We can sense 
the enormous amount of time that went into resolving all of these 
conflicts and achieving a balance between two- and three-dimen¬ 
sional space. Most pictures took Cezanne years to paint as he 
meticulously pondered every mark. (See Primary Source, page 907.) 

In addition to landscape, Cezanne made portraits of acquain¬ 
tances (never commissions, since his father provided him with a 
modest income), still lifes, and figure paintings, especially bathers 
in a landscape, and in every genre we can see the same conflicts 
and suppression of tension. In his 1879-83 Still Life with Apples in 
a Bowl (fig. 26.2), we can immediately sense a Chardinesque mon- 
umentality (see fig. 22.9). There is a balancing of apples in the 
compote (stemmed bowl) with those on the dish, and a balancing 
of the folds of the white cloth with the wallpaper s leaf motif. 


906 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) 

From a letter to Emile Bernard 

Bernard had worked with Gauguin to formulate the style of the Pont- 
Aven School. He began a correspondence with Cezanne after meeting him 
at Aix-en-Provence in the spring of1904, when this letter was written. 

M ay I repeat what I told you here: treat nature by the cylinder, 
the sphere, the cone, everything in proper perspective so that 


each side of an object or a plane is directed towards a central point. 
Lines parallel to the horizon give breadth, that is a section of nature 
or, if you prefer, of the spectacle that the Pater Omnipotens Aeterne 
Deus spreads out before our eyes. Lines perpendicular to this horizon 
give depth. But nature for us men is more depth than surface, whence 
the need of introducing into our light vibrations, represented by reds 
and yellows, a sufficient amount of blue to give the impression of air. 



Source: Paul Cezanne: Letters, Ed. John Rewald, Tr. Marguerite Kay (London: Bruno 
Cassirer, 1 946) 



Everything is framed by the forceful horizontal edges of the table. 
Each apple has a powerful physical presence as it is built up out 
of slablike brushstrokes, its form also carefully delineated with a 
distinct line. The folds of the cloth are equally plastic, their illu- 
sionistic tactility reinforced by the concrete presence of parallel 
bricks of paint. But the picture also has a nervous energy and 
ethereal flatness: The compote refuses to recede in space because 
its back lip tips forward. The same is true of the dish. Its edges 
disappear behind the apples and we have difficulty imagining 
their connection to each other in space. The tabletop is also 


spatially disorienting, for it tilts forward and up the canvas rather 
than moving back into space. The chunks of brushstrokes are 
obviously flat marks, and they cover the surface with a nervous 
energy. This energy is epitomized by the strange interior life that 
the folds of the cloth seem to have. Meanwhile, the wallpaper s 
leaf pattern momentarily does a reversal as it escapes its two- 
dimensional assignment to take on a three-dimensional life, one 
as concrete as that of the apples or folds of cloth. Cezanne 
has abandoned faithfully observed reality to create his own picto¬ 
rial world, one that adheres to a private aesthetic order and

acknowledges with every move that art is inherently abstract— 
painting is first and foremost about putting paint on canvas to 
create an arrangement of line and color. 

Cezannes art became increasingly abstract in the last ten years 
of his life, as can be seen in Mont Sainte-V ictoire Seen from 
Bibemus (Quarry (fig. 26.3), painted from 1897 to 1900. Mont 
Sainte-Victoire was a favorite motif, almost an obsession, as it 
appeared in over 60 late paintings and watercolors. The deep vista 
we saw in the earlier view of the mountain has now been replaced 
with a more compressed version. The overlapping of representa¬ 
tional objects is one of the few devices suggesting depth. Other¬ 
wise, the image is an intense network of carefully constructed 
brushstrokes, lines, and colors that begs to be read as an intricate 
spaceless tapestry. The foreground trees bleed into the quarry rock, 
or on the upper right into the sky. The sky in turn melds into the 
mountain, from which it is distinguished only by the defining line 
of the summit. No matter how flat and airless, the image, as with 
any Impressionist picture, paradoxically is also filled with light, 
space, and movement. Looking at this hermetic picture, we can¬ 
not help but feel how the tension and energy of his early roman¬ 
tic pictures were suppressed and channeled into a struggle to 
create images that balanced his direct observation of nature with 
his desire to abstract natures forms. Here is the work of the 
painter most responsible for freeing the medium from a represen¬ 
tational role and giving artists license to invent images that instead 
adhered to painting’s own inherent laws. The Paris gallery Durand- 
Ruel began exhibiting the withdrawn, unknown Cezanne in the 
late 1890s, and in 1907, at his death, he had a retrospective at the 
avant-garde Salon d’Automne exhibition, which had a powerful 


influence on contemporary artists, especially Pablo Picasso and 
Henri Matisse, as we shall see in the next chapter. 

Georges Seurat: Seeking Social and 
Pictorial Harmony 

Like Cezanne, Georges Seurat (1859-1891) wanted to make 
Impressionism more like the great art of the past. He studied 
briefly in 1878 at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts with a follower of 
Ingres, and after a year of compulsory military service in Brittany 
returned to Paris, where he spent the rest of his short life. He set 
up a studio, where he worked intensively in isolation, and in 1884 
he unveiled his new style with a large picture called A Bathing 
Place , Asnieres , which depicts a group of laborers swimming in the 
Seine in a working-class suburb of Paris, not far from where 
Seurat grew up. The picture, refused at the Salon, was shown in 
1884 at the first exhibition of the Independent Artists, a new 
artists’ cooperative whose shows were unjuried like those of the 
Impressionists’ Artists’, Inc. Seurat next participated in what 
would be the last Impressionist exhibition, in 1886, submitting A 
Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (fig. 26.4). The 
dates of the two shows are significant, for they mark the end of 
the Impressionist era and the rise of Post-Impressionism. 

La Grande Jatte 3 s roots in the Realism of Manet and in 
Monet’s Impressionist canvases are obvious, since this is a scene 
of the middle class taking its Sunday leisure on a sunny color- 
filled afternoon. The painting presents a compendium of types 
that contemporaries would have easily recognized, such as the 
courtesan, shown walking a monkey and the boatman, who is the

sleeveless man smoking a pipe in the left corner. (Seurat s cata¬ 
loging of types extends to the dogs in the foreground and boats 
on the Seine.) Seurat renders his figures as icons, for each is sil¬ 
houetted in profile, frontally, or in a three-quarter view, following 
the prescription of the famous Roman architect Vitruvius for the 
arrangement of sculptural figures on temples. Seurat declared that 
he wanted “to make the moderns file past like figures on Pheidias 5 
Panathenaic frieze on the Parthenon, in their essential form. ” And 
this was no idle claim. The 6-by-l 0-foot canvas was meant to 
function on the scale of great history painting and be seen in the 
tradition of Poussin and David. Like a history painter, Seurat 


made detailed studies for every component of his work, even pro¬ 
ducing a painting of the landscape alone, before the insertion of 
the figures, and looking like a stage set. 

INFLUENCE OF PUVIS DE CHAVANNES Critics noted that 
Seurat s La Grand Jatte recalls the Classical murals of Pierre Puvis 
de Chavannes (1824-1898), whose work was so ubiquitous that 
his fame was widespread by the 1880s. His paintings, such as The 
Sacred Grove , Beloved of the Arts and Muses (fig. 26.5), are set in 
an idyllic mythical or biblical past where life is serene, bountiful, 
and carefree. In Puvis s world there is little movement, and

certainly no exertion. Without appearing geometric, everything is 
orderly, either vertical or horizontal, with a soothing planarity 
bringing everything into harmonious alignment. The decorative 
flatness evokes ancient murals as well as fourteenth- and fifteenth- 
century Italian frescoes. There is a minimum of detail, endowing 
the picture with a tranquil and unencumbered look. His figures 
tend to be silhouetted in profile or frontal, and often have an 
archaic angularity and simplicity that adds to the aura of primitive 
purity and innocence. Puvis, who emerged from the academic 
ranks in the early 1860s, provided a startling Classical alternative 
to Bouguereau (see page 866), although his classicizing, dreamy 
images often appealed to the same conservative audience. By the 
1880s, they would attract the avant-garde as well, which saw in 
their visionary world and abstract simplicity the same sanctuary 
from modern life that they too were trying to attain. 

SEURAT AND NEO-IMPRESSIONISM As much as Seurat 
was influenced by Puvis, his agenda could not have been more 
different, for instead of escaping into a distant past his goal was to 
create a utopian present, a poetic vision of middle- and working- 
class tranquility and leisure. His religion was not just Classicism, 
but also science. Familiar with the color theory of the American 
physicist Ogden Rood, he believed that colors were more intense 
when mixed optically by the viewers eye rather than on the 
palette. Consequently, he would build up his paint surface, first 
laying down a thin layer of a partially mixed local color, over 
which came a layer of short strokes of related hues, and finally a 
top layer of equally sized dots of primary and binary color (fig. 
26.6). As explained in an 1886 article by Seurats friend, the art 
critic Felix Feneon, this top layer of “colors, isolated on the can¬ 
vas, recombine on the retina: we have, therefore, not a mixture of 
material colors (pigments), but a mixture of differently colored 
rays of light. 55 It does not matter that Seurat misinterpreted Rood 
and that the claim is not true. Seurat believed his colors were more 
luminous than the Impressionists 5 , and certainly his technique, 
which he called “Chromohiminarism 55 and scholars later labeled

“Pointillism 55 or “Divisionism, 55 created a uniform, if vibrant, sur¬ 
face that was a kind of systematized Impressionism. Like the fig¬ 
ures, the regularized surface of Seurat s pictures seem mechanical, 
as though the subjective hand-eye reaction of the Impressionist 
has been replaced by a machine capable of recording color and 
light with uniform dots of paint. 

In his review of the 1886 Impressionist show, Feneon labeled 
Seurat s style Neo-Impressionism—the “New Impressionism 55 — 
and before the decade was out, it had an army of practitioners 
who were attracted to its scientific approach, monumentality, and 
modern look. Many worked well into the twentieth century. As 
distinctive as the technique is, it would be a mistake to emphasize 
it at the expense of the meaning of the art. Seurat was a socialist 
sympathizer and was dedicated to creating a utopia of middle- 
and working-class tranquility and leisure. His socialist vision of a 
harmonious, perfect world and belief in science as the force to 
make this happen characterize his method. 

Seurats experimental approach led him to the theories of 
French psychophysiologist Charles Henry as outlined in his 
treatise A Scientific Aesthetic (1885). Henry claimed that colors, as 
well as lines, carried specific emotional meaning (e.g., yellow or a 


910 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 







Lithography 

G rease rejects water. Starting with that principle, Aloys Senefelder, 
an inspector of maps at the royal printing office in Munich, 
invented the process of lithography shortly before 1 800. Essentially, 
an artist draws on stone with greasy crayon or ink, called tusche. 
The stone is then dampened with water, which is absorbed into 
the porous stone, except where there is tusche drawing. The print- 
maker next applies printer’s ink, which adheres only where there 
are tusche marks. The stone is then put through a press, and the 
image is printed in reverse on paper. The process requires such 
technical proficiency that artists usually work with skilled litho¬ 
graphers who do the technical work and “pull” the prints, that is, they 
run the paper through the press. A later variation of the process 
allowed artists to draw with tusche on paper, which was then trans¬ 
ferred onto the stone. Artists immediately embraced lithography, and 
it became one of the most popular print mediums of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries. 

Unlike engraving plates (see Materials and Techniques, page 501), 
which wear down with repeated printing and require frequent 
strengthening of the lines, lithography needs no maintenance, and a 
seemingly unlimited number of prints could be produced from a 
single stone. Toward 1 830, paper was becoming less expensive and 
literacy was growing, a combination that increased the medium’s 
appeal to newspaper and magazine publishers, whose print runs were 
rising. Of the many newspaper illustrators who worked in lithography, 
Honore Daumier became the most celebrated (see fig. 25.4). 


With the development of larger printing presses and the ability to 
print in several colors, lithography became the preferred medium for 
posters, which in the closing decades of the nineteenth century began 
to feature images in addition to words. Advertisers now wanted 
pictures of their products and strong colors so that their poster would 
stand out from other advertisements. Artists responded. Large colored 
lithographic posters began to plaster the sides of buildings, commer¬ 
cial wagons, and omnibuses, reflecting the consumerism overtaking 
Europe. The art world quickly recognized the aesthetic merits of many 
such posters, and in 1 889 a poster exhibition was mounted for the 
International Exposition at the Palace of Liberal Arts in Paris. Collectors 
began buying posters, galleries began selling them, and artists made 
them with collectors in mind. Today, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is 
among the most acclaimed of the artists who made colored litho¬ 
graphic posters (see fig. 26.8). 



line rising from a horizontal connotes happiness, while blue or a 
descending line evokes sadness). Seurat put this theory into prac¬ 
tice in the major paintings of his last five years, genre paintings of 
popular urban entertainment, such as circuses and cabarets. In the 
joyous and festive Le Chahut (fig. 26.7) of 1889-90, we cannot 
miss the dominant yellow hue and upward thrusting lines. The 
scene represents the finale of a cancanlike dance at a nightclub 
near Seurat’s studio, a scene so closely based on reality that the 
actual performers can be identified, although they, like the audi¬ 
ence to either side of the runway, function as a catalogue of types 
as well. Seurat uses a Degas-like skewered, cropped, and conflated 
composition, which he then freezes, transforming figures and 
even furniture, such as the gas lamps, into powerful icons. We can 
never mistake Seurat’s images for Realism; instead he presents an 
idealized world. His passionate belief in science, technology, and 
machines as the tools to attain progress and equality will be shared 
by later generations of artists, especially following World War I. 

Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec: 

An Art for the Demimonde 

Paradoxically, Seurat, along with the other Post-Impressionist 
artists, constituted a new avant-garde that would lead art down a 
path that made it esoteric and thus incomprehensible for mass 
audiences. The artist who succeeded in capturing urban exuberance 


and decadence at the close of the nineteenth century for the wider 
public was Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901). His pictures 
of the Cirque Fernando were exhibited at the circus, while those 
of dancehalls, cabarets, and nightclubs (that is, the shadowy 
nightlife of the demimonde, or fringe society) were shown at 
those same venues, although he also exhibited with the new 
artists’ cooperatives. His widest impact, however, was made 
through his large colorful lithographic posters advertising these 
popular spectacles, which were plastered in public places all over 
Paris. His images of urban nightlife became the public’s percep¬ 
tion as well, and his work continues to form our image of jin-de- 
siecle Paris. (See Materials and Technique s, above.) 

Toulouse-Lautrec was a master of caricature, as can be seen in 
La Goulue (fig. 26.8), which features the popular Moulin Rouge 
dancer Louise Weber, nicknamed La Goulue (The Glutton), who 
is credited with creating the French dance the cancan. The Moulin 
Rouge was a cabaret located in Montmartre, a bohemian neigh¬ 
borhood notorious for its raucous, low-class nightclubs. Lautrec 
himself settled there after coming to Paris in 1882 from his home¬ 
town in the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where he was born 
into an aristocratic but not particularly wealthy family. He was 
crippled by a genetic disease and childhood leg injuries, which 
resulted in his having a man’s torso on a child’s legs, and being 
only 5'1" tall. This handicap did not prevent him from thriving in 
the thick of the bohemian nightlife of Montmartre, where he was

a regular at the clubs and brothels, the subject of his art, before 
dying of alcoholism at the age of 36. 

Toulouse-Lautrec initially studied privately with an academic 
painter, but embraced the avant-garde upon discovering the art of 
Degas. In addition, he was heavily influenced by Japanese art. 
Both sources can be seen in the flat silhouettes, cropping, and 
conflated space of La Goulue , and Degas in the subject matter. But 
Toulouse-Lautrec is more abstract than Degas, abandoning natu¬ 
ralism for cartoonish fantasy and working with a minimum of 
marks and flat planes of color and line. Unlike Seurat, who creates 
a three-dimensional monumental world, Toulouse-Lautrecs 
vision is paper-thin. And it is satirical. With this stripped-down 
vocabulary, he captures La Goulue s physical exertion as well as 


her psychological isolation and detachment. He poignantly 
contrasts the animated La Goulue with the bizarre, zombielike 
profile of Valentin le desosse (“Valentin the Boneless”), famous for 
his idiosyncratic dancing. Toulouse-Lautrec is able to succinctly 
elicit the collective spirit and rhythm of the dancing through the 
repetition of silhouetted feet, a rhythm picked up by the repeti¬ 
tion of the words “Moulin Rouge” above and the three yellow gas 
lamps. Even the lettering, with its staggered placement and shifts 
in scale, adds to the beat of the picture, as does the syncopation of 
the limited color. The floorboards streaking back add to the pace 
of the image. With minimal effort, Toulouse-Lautrec even tells us 
much about the shadowy audience, for he has catalogued a range 
of types by presenting the shapes of their hats. But despite the 
illusion of gaiety, there is something empty and soulless in this 
picture, suggested by La Goulues weary expression, the 
distorted, if not ominous Valentin le desosse , and the dark anony¬ 
mous onlookers. Toulouse-Lautrec presents a dissolute world, 
one he knew all too well, and one that represented the fruit of 
advanced civilization. This is the decadent fin-de-siecle Paris from 
which artists like Van Gogh and Gauguin will try to escape. 


Vincent van Gogh: 

Expression Through Color and Symbol 

Before becoming a painter, the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh 
(1853-1890) had tried his hand at, among other things, preaching 
and teaching. Drawn to these vocations by his desire for a life 
both spiritually fulfilling and socially useful, Van Gogh eventually 
determined that art alone could provide access to the ideal world 
he sought. After receiving a rudimentary art training, he spent the 
years 1883 through 1885 painting at the family’s vicarage (his 
father was a pastor) in the village of Nuenen in Holland, where he 
was deeply affected by the dignity, spirituality, and stolid sturdi¬ 
ness of the impoverished peasants. His major work from this 
period, The Potato Eaters (fig. 26.9), reflects his compassion and 
respect for the underclasses, as described in one of the 650 pages 
of letters he wrote to Theo, his brother: “I have tried to empha¬ 
size that these people eating their potatoes in the lamplight, have 
dug the earth with those very hands they put in the dish, and so it 
speaks of manual labor, and how they have honestly earned their 
food. I have wanted to give an impression of a way of life quite 
different from us civilized human beings.” Here, we see Van 
Gogh s admiration and respect for a simple life based on direct 
contact with nature as well as his suspicion of bourgeois values 
and urban modernity His artistic role models include Millet, 
whose powerful and sympathetic depictions of peasants are 
echoed in Van Gogh s, and his countryman Rembrandt, whose 
tenebrism shrouds this humble, almost ritualistic supper in a 
reverential cloak. What especially distinguishes this image is Van 
Goghs excited expressionism, which gives the picture a raw, 
crude energy that simultaneously endows the peasants with a 
surging elemental vitality and reflects the artist s own uncontain- 
able enthusiasm and passion for his subject matter. Gnarled 
fingers and hands, prominent twisted physiognomies, rippling

folds of clothing, ceiling beams that recede with eruptive force, a 
clock and a picture of the Crucifixion that seem to jump off rather 
than hang on the wall—everything explodes within the picture, 
despite the tranquility of this event of work-weary laborers tak¬ 
ing their frugal evening meal. Van Gogh’s thick excited marks, 
which convey his overbearing enthusiasm and compassion, rein¬ 
force the powerful physical presence of his peasants. 

In 1885, Van Gogh briefly enrolled at the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Antwerp, where he studied Rubens’s paintings and col¬ 
lected Japanese prints, which he admired for their abstract quali¬ 
ties and because of their bright colors and nonindustrial imagery 
mistakenly believed presented a rural, utopian world. Unhappy in 
Belgium, Van Gogh then went to Paris to be with his brother, who 
handled the contemporary painting department at an art gallery. 
Here, from 1886 to 1888, he experienced Impressionism and Neo- 
Impressionism first hand, consuming their lessons with the same 
fervor he applied to everything else. His bold energetic brush- 
work now carried primary and binary hues and his pictures were 
filled with color and light. Restless as always, he started hounding 
fellow painters to join him in starting an artists’ commune in the 
sun-drenched south of France, a "Studio of the South,” which he 
envisioned as an Occidental Japan. 

Only Paul Gauguin bought into this dream, and even he only 
lasted two months, finding Van Gogh’s intense troubled person¬ 
ality insufferable. Alone in Arles, Van Gogh thrived in the 
Provencal landscape, fiercely generating from 1888 to 1889 his 
strongest body of work, including Night Cafe and Starry Night. 
His intense uncontrollable emotions took over and his painting 


became increasingly expressionistic, using color and brushwork 
abstractly to convey emotion rather than to document reality and 
employing a personal symbolic vocabulary. In Night Cafe (fig. 
26.10), he registered his revulsion at an Arles den of iniquity, 
claiming he wanted "to express the terrible passions of humanity 
by means of red and green. ” This symbolic use of complementary 
color visually creates a harsh acidic atmosphere, made all the 
more sour by the jarring range of off-greens that appear on the 
billiard table, tabletops, bar, ceiling, and even in the waiter’s 
hair. The morbid blood-red of the walls bleeds into the strident 
floorboards, whose fiery yellow seems to connote hell, not happi¬ 
ness, an aura reinforced by the rays emanating from the gas 
ceiling lamps. 

The personality that prevailed in the majority of Van Gogh’s 
pictures, however, is the one that painted The Potato Eaters , the 
one that belonged to the secular evangelist who celebrated all life 
and longed for universal harmony. This can be seen in Starry 
Night (fig. 26.11), painted after the artist committed himself to a 
mental institution near Saint-Remy in Provence. Here, we see the 
inviting hearth-lit homes of plain rural folk, snugly ensconced in 
a valley, which is pervaded by a spiritual, celestial blue, the same 
color as the sky, uniting both. The yellow glow from the rectan¬ 
gular windows visually ties the homes with the yellow round stars 
in the universe above, their contrasting shapes a kind of yin and 
yang of elemental harmony. An upwardly spiraling cypress tree, 
filled with life, which it symbolizes, dominates the foreground. Its 
verticality echoes that of the church steeple, suggesting its spiritu¬ 
ality, and both penetrate the fiery, star-filled sky, linking earth

with the transcendental. The sky is alight with spectacular cosmic 
fireworks—haloes of stars and joyous tumbling clouds reflect the 
undulation of the mountains and trees below. There is no mistak¬ 
ing this visionary painting, filled with expressionistic, abstract 
color and brushwork and personal symbolism, for a Realist or 
Impressionist picture. Here, Van Gogh created the primitive 
world and utopia he always dreamed of inhabiting: the peaceful 
tranquility of simple, unpretentious people, nurtured by nature 
and in harmony with universal forces. Despite his frenetic output 
and humanitarian commitment, Van Gogh, deeply troubled, 
depressed, and suffering from seizures, committed suicide within 
a year of painting Starry Night. 

Paul Gauguin: The Flight from Modernity 

Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), the fourth of the major Post- 
Impressionists, shared Van Gogh s distaste for advanced civiliza¬ 
tion and likewise yearned for a utopian alternative. His abandon¬ 
ment of society, however, was perhaps the most radical of any 
artist of his time. A Parisian stockbroker, he was attracted to art, 
collected the Impressionists, and, by the early 1870s, had taken up 
painting himself. He lost his job in 1882 and began to paint full 
time. He studied with his friend Pissarro, who introduced him 
to the work of Cezanne, and participated in the last four Impres¬ 
sionist exhibitions between 1881 and 1886. In 1886, he abandoned 
Paris to begin a nomadic search for a more meaningful existence, 


which he believed existed in a simpler society in tune with nature. 
He first went to the village of Pont-Aven, a remote, rural commu¬ 
nity in Brittany. Here, locals wore a distinctive regional costume 
and displayed an intense, charismatic piety. 

After briefly leaving Brittany for the Caribbean island of 
Martinique in 1887, Gauguin returned to Pont-Aven in 1888, 
where he painted with a colleague, Emile Bernard. They were 
joined by other artists, who came to be called the “Pont-Aven 
School. ” Together they developed a style they called Synthetism, 
a reference to their synthetic production of images based on 
imagination and emotion as opposed to a mimetic, empirical 
replication of reality. In their search to produce an authentic, 
direct art, as free of civilized influences as possible, they turned to 
a variety of vernacular and primitive sources, including crude 
popular illustrations (especially religious) and folk, children s, and 
medieval art. They were also attracted by what they viewed as 
archaic styles, such as the fourteenth-century Italian primitives 
and both Egyptian and Mesopotamian art, art that was not natu¬ 
ralistic. Especially appealing to them were medieval stained-glass 
windows, because of their spiritual function and saturated colors, 
and cloisonne enamels, which similarly use curvilinear lead 
dividers to separate areas of flat color. 

The impact of medieval glass and cloisonne is apparent in 
Gauguin s The Vision after the Sermon (fig. 26.12), where an undu¬ 
lating blue line encases flat planes of color. Gauguin presents a 
group of Breton women just after they have heard a sermon about

Jacob wrestling with the angel. The artist attributes to the women 
a blind, nai've piety that allows them to see spirituality in such 
mundane objects as a cow, whose shape resembles the two strug¬ 
gling biblical figures the priest has just described. In a bold 
composition that conceptually comes from Japanese prints (see 
fig. 25.13), Gauguin places the cow and the wrestlers to either side 
of a tree, sharply contrasted on an intense mystical field of red. 
The objects of the womens vision clearly exist in an otherworldly 
sphere, where they appear to float magically. Everything seems 
possessed in Gauguin s picture, invested with an unseen religios¬ 
ity. The string ties on two of the womens caps are animated and 
snakelike, while the silhouettes of the hats on the two women 
seen from the back on the right seem to take on a life all their own. 
Flat, curvilinear forms, and even forms within forms, can be 
found throughout the image, levitating, just as the cow and the 
wrestling figures do. 

Despite its provincial charm and remove from Paris, Brittany 
for Gauguin was geographically far too close to modern civiliza¬ 
tion and its decadent materialism. (Seasonally, it was also overrun 
with tourists.) In 1891, therefore, he left for the French colony of 
Tahiti in the South Pacific, convinced that on this remote island he 
would find Jean-Jacques Rousseau s “noble savage,” an elemental, 
innocent human, “a primitive” steeped in nature and in harmony 
with the universe. In Tahiti, he also felt he would be able “to go 
back...as far back as the dada from my childhood, the good old 
wooden horse.” ( Dada is French for “rocking horse.”) He 
expected to live in a tropical Garden of Eden, uncovering the 
most basic truths about human existence. And a Garden of Eden 
is what he depicts in Where Do We Come From? What Are We? 
Where Are We Going? (fig. 26.13) from 1897. Fruit hangs from the 
trees for the picking, while a statue of a god oversees the welfare 
of the islanders, bestowing blessings and an intense spirituality on 


every aspect of daily life, while pointing to heaven and the after¬ 
life. The tropical landscape is dense, lush, and sensuous, an 
abstract tapestry of deeply saturated, flat curvilinear forms in 
which everything seems to gently float. Fife is languorous and 
untroubled, and time has stopped. When the picture was shown 
in Paris, critics, not surprisingly, compared it with Puviss 
Classical worlds of milk and honey (see page 909). 

As the title suggests, the painting represents the three stages of 
life—birth is pictured on the right, youth in the center, and old 
age at the far left. The entire painting is a remarkable synthesis of 
cultures, religions, and periods, testifying to Gauguin s desire to 
portray the elemental mythic forces underlying all humanity. The 
center figure is a Tahitian Eve. The statue of the deity on the left 
is a compilation of the Tahitian goddess Hina, a Javanese Buddha, 
and an Easter Island megalith. The old woman on the left is 
derived from a Peruvian mummy Gauguin saw at a Paris ethno¬ 
logical museum. Torsos are twisted so that they resemble 
Egyptian figures, and the bright gold upper corners with title and 
signature recall Byzantine and Early Renaissance icons. Pervading 
the image is the spirituality and look of medieval stained glass, as 
well as the bold forms and colors of Japanese prints. 

Where Do We Gome From? is a reflection of Gauguin s belief 
that the renewal of Western art and civilization as a whole must 
come from outside its own traditions, which he perceived as being 
corrupt. He advised other artists to shun Graeco-Roman forms 
and to turn instead to Persia, the Far East, and ancient Egypt for 
inspiration. This idea itself was not new. It stems from the 
Romantic myth of the noble savage and the ideas of the 
Enlightenment more than a century earlier, and its ultimate source 
is the age-old belief in an earthly paradise where people once 
lived, and might one day live again, in a state of nature and inno¬ 
cence. No artist before Gauguin had gone as far in putting this

Paul Gauguin (1848-1903) 

From a letter to J. F. Willumsen 

The Danish painter J. F. Willumsen was a member of Gauguin's circle 
in Brittany. Gauguin wrote this letter to him in the autumn of1890, 
he fore his departure for the South Seas. 

A s for me, my mind is made up. I am going soon to Tahiti, a small 
island in Oceania, where the material necessities of life can be 
had without money. I want to forget all the misfortunes of the past, 
I want to be free to paint without any glory whatsoever in the eyes of 
the others and I want to die there and to be forgotten there. ... A 
terrible epoch is brewing in Europe for the coming generation: the 


kingdom of gold. Everything is putrefied, even men, even the arts. 
There, at least, under an eternally summer sky, on a marvellously fer¬ 
tile soil, the Tahitian has only to lift his hands to gather his food; and 
in addition he never works. When in Europe men and women survive 
only after unceasing labor during which they struggle in convulsions 
of cold and hunger, a prey to misery, the Tahitians, on the contrary, 
happy inhabitants of the unknown paradise of Oceania, know only 
sweetness of life. To live, for them, is to sing and to love. ... Once my 
material life is well organized, I can there devote myself to great

doctrine of “primitivism”—as it was called—into practice. His 
pilgrimage to the South Pacific had more than a purely private 
meaning: It symbolized the end of the 400 years of expansion that 
had brought most of the globe under Western domination. 
Colonialism, once so cheerfully—and ruthlessly—pursued by the 
empire builders, was, for many, becoming a symbol of Western 
civilization s corruption. Gauguin was disappointed to discover 
that large portions of Tahiti had already been spoiled by coloniza¬ 
tion, the French absorbing it as a protectorate in 1842 and making 
it a fully fledged colony in 1880. 

SYMBOLISM 

Although Gauguin devised the label Synthetism to describe his 
art, he was soon heralded as a Symbolist. Symbolism was a liter¬ 
ary movement announced in a manifesto issued by poet Jean 
Moreas (1856-1910) in the newspaper Figaro Litteraire in 1886. 
The poet Charles Baudelaire, author of a book of poems titled 
Flowers of Evil (1857), was considered a forebear of the move¬ 
ment, and the poets Stephen Mallarme and Paul Verlaine ranked 
among its salient representatives. Another poet, Gustave Kahn, 
succinctly encapsulated the movement s essence when he wrote 
shortly after the appearance of Moreas s manifesto that the 
writer s goal was to “objectify the subjective...instead of subjecti¬ 
fying the objective,” meaning the everyday, contemporary world 
was to be rejected, and replaced by one of dreams that abstractly 
expressed sensations, moods, and deepseated fears and desires. 
The label was soon extended to the visual arts, and Gauguin s 
name always topped anyone’s list of important Symbolists. Van 
Gogh, with his expressionist fantasies, was considered a 
Symbolist as well. In 1891, art critic Georges-Albert Aurier 
defined Symbolism with five adjectives: “ideal, symbolist, syn- 
thetist, subjective, and decorative.” Gauguin himself felt com¬ 
pelled to use Symbolist terminology to describe his painting 
Where Do We Gome Fromf when it was exhibited at Ambroise 
Vollard s gallery in Paris in 1898. Writing from Tahiti, he stressed 
the picture was “musical,” declaring that it communicated via the 


abstract qualities of line, color, and form, and not through anec¬ 
dote. At this time, the rich, chromatic operas of Richard Wagner 
(1813-1883), filled with intense passion and psychological urges, 
were the rage in Paris, as they were throughout Europe and 
America, and they inspired Symbolist writers and painters alike to 
use abstract means to project powerful emotional yearnings and 
tap into the most elemental states of mind. 

The Nabis 

Gauguin s impact was tremendous, and by the 1890s, flat curvilin¬ 
ear organic patterning was ubiquitous. For example, it is the basis 
for Toulouse-Lautrec s posters, and it is apparent in many of his 
oils as well. Gauguin was also the formative influence on the 
Nabis, a secret organization founded in 1888 by young Parisian 
artists, including Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, who were 
stunned by the novelty and spirituality of Gauguin s Pont-Aven 
paintings. Nabi is Hebrew for “prophet,” and as the name sug¬ 
gests, the members immersed themselves in religion of all kinds as 
well as in the occult and the supernatural. 

Although the Nabis broke up by the mid-1890s, Edouard 
Vuillard (1868-1940), along with Bonnard, developed into a 
major artist. Abandoning the group s religious thrust, he retained 
its emphasis on emotion expressed through abstraction, which 
fellow Nabis member Maurice Denis summed up in a famous 
quote when he wrote, “A picture—before being a warhorse, a 
female nude, or some anecdote—is essentially a flat surface 
covered with colors in a particular order.” Reality dissolving into 
an abstraction of emotion can be seen in Vuillard s small intimate 
oil of 1893, The Suitor (fig. 26.14). Here, we see the artist s favorite 
theme, interiors, which are magical, not mundane. He presents his 
dressmaker mother, his sister, and her husband, a respected 
painter and member of the Nabis. The real world disappears in a 
poetry of paint. Lush, dappled brushwork and a subdued but col¬ 
orful, rich palette create a tranquil, sensuous mood. Tables, chairs, 
figures, and bolts of fabric are two-dimensional ghosts floating in 
an enchanting sea of paint, color, and form that embodies the 
sweet intimacy and languid pace of bourgeois domesticity.

Other Symbolist Visions in France 

Two artists predating Symbolism were embraced by the move¬ 
ment: Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon. Moreau emerged in 
the 1860s, and Redon the following decade. Both gained in notor¬ 
iety when they were featured in Joris-Karl Huysmans s notorious 
1884 Symbolist novel A Rehours (Against Nature). Huysmans s 
protagonist, Des Esseintes, an aristocrat, is a jaded decadent 
eccentric who leaves Paris and retreats to a remote village. Here, 
the self-obsessed recluse transforms his house into a strange 
dreamworld, filled with wondrous objects reflecting his personal 
dissolute aesthetic. In one famous chapter, Des Esseintes, in order 
to display his gems, has them affixed to a tortoise, which, heavily 
laden with the stones, collapses and dies after a few steps. His 
walls are decorated with prints of artworks by Moreau and Redon. 

GUSTAVE MOREAU The imagery of Gustave Moreau (1826— 
1898) combined exotic Romantic motifs with an unsettling, 
mysterious psychology set in a supernatural world. In his large 
watercolor The Apparition (fig. 26.15) of about 1876, we see the 
New Testament tale of Salome being presented with the head of 
St. John the Baptist. Herod, touched by his stepdaughter’s dance 
at his birthday feast, granted Salome one wish, and at her mother’s 
request, she asked for the Baptist’s head. But instead of appearing 
on a charger, as is traditional, the head, encased in a radiant halo 
and gushing blood that pools on the floor, magically levitates. We 
see a bold stare-down between good and evil and between wan¬ 
ton sexuality and stern morality, as suggested by Salome’s scant 
costume and erotic pose and John’s stoic, condemning visage. The 


decoration and costumes are Near Eastern, and the vast Classical 
hall dazzles with imperial opulence. Flowers, clothing, columns, 
and walls are created with minute, gemlike brushstrokes that are 
reminiscent of Delacroix (see page 843) and make everything 
sparkle. (Even the palette is Delacroix’s.) In Moreau’s hands, the 
story of Salome is not simply illustrated, but becomes a macabre 
hallucination of sex and death, presented through a dazzling haze 
of jewel-like marks and a smoldering, golden light. 

ODILON REDON Even more visionary and dreamlike are the 
intense images of another artist claimed by the Symbolists, Odilon 
Redon (1840-1916). His drawings and prints deliver crepuscular 
fantasies enveloped in a velvety blurring of black charcoal or lith¬ 
ographic crayon. Among many sources, he especially drew inspi¬ 
ration from the grim, horrifying prints of Goya (see fig. 24.1). 
Redons style can be seen in the lithograph reproduced here from 
an 1878 series dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe (fig. 26.16). Trans¬ 
lated into French by Baudelaire and Mallarme, Poe’s terrifying

psychological tales were popular in France. Redon was inspired 
by Poes Romantic mood, but his lithographs do not illustrate Poe 
directly: They are “visual poems” in their own right, evoking the 
macabre, hallucinatory world of Poes imagination. If Goya cre¬ 
ated very pointed horrific nightmares, Redon envisions nebulous 
poetic dreams. Things float, glide, and hover, and edges are soft, 
grainy, and indistinct. Everything in Redons world is in doubt 
and in some kind of strange evolutionary flux. Here, a balloon 
quietly morphs into a hairy eye and parts the sky as it rises up to 
heaven carrying a head severed at the nose. Below, a primordial 
plant with pyrotechnic fronds glows against a forbidding dark 
sea. Connotations of resurrection, transcendence, a rite of 
passage, life, death, eternity, and the unknown are embedded in 
The Eye , but the image s narrative meaning remains shrouded in 
mystery. Instead, what prevails is a troubling psychology and a 
feeling of frightening uncertainty. 

HENRI ROUSSEAU A Symbolist preoccupation with portray¬ 
ing fundamental human urges and the psychology of sexual desire 
can also be seen in the work of Henri Rousseau (1844-1910), who 
was essentially self-taught and because of his nai've style is labeled 
a “primitive painter. ” A retired customs officer who started paint¬ 
ing in the mid-1880s, Rousseau took as his ideal the hard-edged 
academic style of the followers of Ingres (see fig. 24.13), which in 
his autodidactic hands took on a charming, simplistic look. He 
sought inspiration in illustrated books and the botanical gardens 
in Paris. “When I go into the glass houses [of the botanical gar¬ 
dens] and I see the strange plants of exotic lands, it seems to me 
that I enter a dream. ” We see such a dream in this 1910 painting 
(fig. 26.17), in which he presents a nude woman mysteriously

lying on a sofa in a cardboard stage-set fantasy of a playfully col¬ 
ored, luxuriant jungle. Wide-eyed animals stare voyeuristically at 
her. We assume they are male, as suggested by the phallic orange 
snake and the musician playing a flute, an overt symbol of mascu¬ 
line sexual desire. Rousseau gives us an image of sexual longing, 
reinforced by the primordial pull of the jungle with its volup¬ 
tuous iridescent flowers and fruit and the cosmic glow of a full 
moon presiding in the sky. Beginning in 1886, Rousseau showed 
at the Salon des Independants (an annual exhibition of independ¬ 
ent artists), receiving little recognition during his lifetime. But in 
1905, he was discovered by Pablo Picasso and his circle, who 
admired his nai've paintings for their flatness and abstraction as 
well as for their creative honesty and directness. 

Symbolism Beyond France 

Strange dreamlike imagery was not unique to Paris. By the late 
1880s, a Symbolist otherworldly aesthetic of fantasy, escapism, 
and psychology could be found throughout the Western world, 
including America. 

JAMES ENSOR AND LES VINCT In Belgium, Symbolism 
surfaced in the extraordinarily crude and visually aggressive 
paintings of James Ensor (1860-1949), who like Gauguin was 
repulsed by modernity and led a reclusive life above his parents’ 
souvenir shop at the seaside resort of Ostend. In 1877, he enrolled 
in the Brussels Academy of Fine Arts, lasting three years, even 
though he described it as “that establishment for the near-blind” 
and declared, “All the rules, all the canons of art vomit death like 
their bronze brethren.” He identified with socialists and anar¬ 
chists and, in 1883, helped found in Brussels the counterpart of 
the Parisian Independent Artists. Called Les Vingt (The Twenty), 


it offered unjuried exhibitions for a wide range of avant-garde 
Belgium artists, from Impressionists to Neo-Impressionists to 
Symbolists. But when the group started showing Whistler, Seurat, 
and Redon and became international, Ensor, a Belgian nationalist, 
permanently retreated to Ostend, where he immersed himself in 
his own world, one of disgust at the pretenses, artificiality, 
corruption, and lack of values of modern civilization. Turning his 
back on the cold refinement of academic art, he embraced popu¬ 
lar culture, declaring, “Long live nai've and ignorant painting! ” 
His nationalism and loathing of insincere refinement led him to 
admire the grotesque depictions often found in the work of 
Breugel and Bosch (see pages 655-58 and 492-93). The carnivals 
they painted still lived on in Ostend in annual festivals, for which 
the Ensor souvenir shop sold masks. 

Ensor s mature style can be seen in his enormous 14-foot-wide 
Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889 (fig. 26.18), painted in 1888 and 
representing a Second Coming of Christ. Beneath a banner 
declaring “Long Live Socialism” and swallowed up in the crowd 
and pushed into the background is a diminutive Christ on a don¬ 
key. The crowd wear masks, which reveal as opposed to hide the 
greed, corruption, and immorality that resides behind the false 
face of contemporary society. Not only does Ensor appropriate 
the masks from his parents’ shop to give his image a primitive 
grotesqueness, but he paints everything with a crudeness and 
distortion we associate with popular art forms—caricature, graf¬ 
fiti, and nai've and children’s art. A garish red intensified by its 
complement, green, hypes the stridency of this repulsive, claus¬ 
trophobic image. Here, we see the philosophical antithesis of 
Seurat’s genteel La Grande Jatte , which was shown at a Les Vingt 
exhibition the year before and seen by Ensor. The similar scale of 
Christ's Entry suggests Ensor s chaotic vision of ubiquitous evil is 
a sarcastic response to Seurat’s Pollyanna rendition of modernity.

26.1 9 Edvard Munch, The Scream. 1893. Tempera and casein on 
cardboard, 36 x 29" (91.4 x 73.7 cm). Munch Museet, Oslo, Norway. 
(Stolen in May 2003.) 


EDVARD MUNCH Much Symbolist painting was influenced 
by Gauguin s mysterious sinuous patterning and abstraction, as 
well as by a desire to explore visually the most elemental psycho¬ 
logical forces underlying modern civilization. Perhaps no one did 
this better than the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch 
(1863-1944), whose style matured in the early 1890s after he spent 
time in Paris, where he experienced first hand the curvilinear 
planes of Gauguin s Pont-Aven paintings and the intense brush- 
work and color of Van Gogh s Arles pictures. His themes, how¬ 
ever, could not be more different, for his painting investigated the 
psycho-logy of sex and the meaning of existence, thus delving 
into the deepest recesses of the mind, as did the plays of his 
two Scandinavian friends, the playwrights Henrik Ibsen and 
August Strindberg. 

Munch crafts an image of horrifying anxiety in The Scream 
(fig. 26.19), painted in 1893 after he had moved to Berlin. Clasping 
hands to a skull-like head, a grotesquely compressed, writhing 
figure gives voice to a base fear that appears funneled into it from 
the oozing, unstable landscape behind. The violent perspective of 
the uptilted walkway and rapidly receding railing combined with 


the thin streaking brushwork elevates the hysteria to a frightening 
feverish pitch. 

The Scream was perhaps in part prompted by the 1883 erup¬ 
tion of the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa, which was so violent it 
generated the loudest sound heard by any human (the sound¬ 
waves traveled 1,500 miles [2,400 km]) and spewed forth ashes 
that circled the globe, immersing Europe in frightening blood-red 
or blue sunsets for some six months. After witnessing such an 
apocalyptic display of color in Christiania (now Oslo), Munch, 
already in a melancholic mood, wrote in his diary, “I sensed a 
great, infinite scream pass through Nature. ” 

AUBREY BEARDSLEY While a morbid, fear-of-the-infinite 
psychology appears in much of Munch s work, perhaps his most 
prevalent subject is the uncontrollable yearnings of the libido, 
along with the sexual conflict it produces, especially as expressed 
by the femme fatale theme. This is a topic that preoccupied con¬ 
temporary artists and writers. One of the most famous examples 
is Oscar Wilde s French play Salome , which launched a vogue for 
Salome imagery Wilde, an Irish fin-de-siecle writer and notorious 
aesthete, rewrote the biblical story In the New Testament ver¬ 
sion, Salome asks for John s head at her mother behest. In Wilde s 
rewrite, she asks for it herself, because the saint spurns her sexual 
advances. The theme is distinctly sexual passion, with overtones 
of perversion, and its outrageous, bizarre behavior is characteris¬ 
tic of the sort of material relished by the British decadents. The 
play was published in French in 1893, with pictures by the British 
illustrator Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898), who was in Wilde s cir¬ 
cle of decadent writers and artists. In the image reproduced here 
(fig. 26.20), Salome possessively holds John s severed head, which 
although dead still projects disdain. His snakelike hair and her 
octopus coif transform them into a pair of irrational Medusas 
driven by base hatred. John s blood drips into a dark pool, nour¬ 
ishing phallic plants that, like an insidious vine, slither around 
Salome. Their nightmarish confrontation takes place in a flat 
abstract world of curvilinear elegance, one so precious that the 
line virtually disappears at times as it twists in a sultry rhythm. As 
we shall shortly see, this plantlike, tendril quality is stylistically 
characteristic of Art Nouveau (see page 927), an architectural and 
decorative arts style that emerged in the 1890s. But thematically 
the motif is used by Beardsley to reinforce the oppressive deca¬ 
dence of his image. 

GUSTAV KLIMT A fascination with organic patterns and the 
psychological meanings they might convey also pervades the 
work of Gustav Klimt (1862-1918), whose career unfolded 
primarily in Vienna. Beginning in 1902, Klimt made a series of 
paintings centering on the theme of “The Kiss,” the best-known 
version dating from 1907 to 1908 (fig. 26.21). Although reflecting 
Klimt s own personal life (the model was his lover), the theme is 
Symbolist-inspired and relates directly to an 1897 painting by 
Munch of the same title. (In turn, both pictures were inspired by 
Rodin s sculpture The Kiss.) Munch s image presents a couple in a 
similarly unified form, but they are a simple dark mass, with the 


CHAPTER 26 PROGRESS AND ITS DISCONTENTS: POST-IMPRESSIONISM, SYMBOLISM, AND ART NOUVEAU, 1 880-1 905 921 



lovers’ faces frighteningly merging as if consuming one another. 
Klimts version of the theme with its rich surface patterning 
shows a faceless lustful male losing his identity as he is lured by 
passion and consumed by an enticing but indifferent femme 
fatale , who draws him perilously close to the abyss below. (For a 
discussion of the femme fatale theme, see The Art Historian ’s Lens , 
page 923.) 

Formally inspired by the divine shimmer of Byzantine 
mosaics, which he studied first-hand in Ravenna (see page 256), 
Klimt cloaks his figures in richly patterned gold-leafed robes and 
encases them in a halo of bright light. Set on a mountain carpet of 
wild flowers and floating high above a celestial neverland, the 
painting simultaneously suggests the beauty and the spiritual pull 
of passion as well as its fleeting nature and painful consequences. 
In his intricate designs and shifting surfaces, Klimt hints at the 
instability inherent in individual subjectivity and social relations. 

The Kiss has a strong decorative component, most evident in 
the lovers’ exotic robes. In 1897, Klimt was one of 22 founders 
and the first president of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde 
artists’ organization. It was part of a loosely allied international

secession movement that started in Munich in 1892 and spread to 
Berlin that same year as progressive artists broke ranks with 
academic institutions. Not only did the Vienna Secession provide 
an alternative to the conservative academy, but its objectives 
included showcasing the applied arts and breaking down the 
hierarchy that placed painting and sculpture at the pinnacle and 
the decorative arts in the artisanal lower ranks. The secession 
movements equally embraced photography. 

Symbolist Currents in American Art 

In the 1880s, a small number of American artists also began to 
make more ethereal, otherworldly pictures. Today often labeled 
Tonalists, their imagery was more poetic and music-inspired, in 
many respects reflecting Whistler’s Aestheticism (see page 885). 
Generally, no American is grouped with European Symbolism. 
Putting labels aside, however, two artists have strong parallels 
with the movement: Albert Pinkham Ryder and Henry Ossawa 
Tanner. 

ALBERT PINKHAM RYDER Albert Pinkham Ryder (1847- 
1917), a somewhat reclusive New York artist, especially later in 
life, abandoned empirical observation to abstractly express his 
emotions. Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and moving to 
New York in 1867, he studied at the National Academy of Arts. 
Rather than the modern world, it was literature that inspired him, 
in particular works by the medieval English poet Geoffrey 


922 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 
























Feminist Art History 

I t is tempting to view Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss as just another exam¬ 
ple of fin-de-siecle decadence and indulgence, and a preoccupation 
with the psychology of sexual urges. But we can begin to read the 
image in other ways if we ask how this picture and others of its kind 
from this period present women, recognizing that it was made by a 
male and reflects male attitudes toward women. Now we can place the 
picture within the context of the late nineteenth-century feminist 
movement and the emergence of the New Woman, both of which 
threatened male dominance. Interestingly, this new approach to inter¬ 
preting images like The Kiss is itself a product of another feminist 
movement that began late in the twentieth century. 

Feminism emerged from the social radicalism of the 1 960s, and its 
effects on the practice of art history were felt almost immediately. 
Feminist art historians began to reconstruct the careers and examine 
the work of women artists including Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, 
Paula Modersohn-Becker, and Kathe Kollwitz. These studies demon¬ 
strated that women artists, far from being peripheral oddities, con¬ 
tributed importantly to the nineteenth-century avant-garde. In her 
groundbreaking essay of 1 971, “Why Have There Been No Great 
Women Artists?”, Linda Nochlin examined Western notions of genius 
and artistic success and concluded that social and economic factors 
prevented women from achieving the same status as their male coun¬ 
terparts. These factors, rather than inherent ability, were responsible 
for the relative paucity of “great women artists.” Nochlin’s essay 
spurred the historical study of artists’ training, exhibition practices, 
and the effects of the art market on artists’ careers. Other scholars, 
including Griselda Pollock and Rozsika Parker, went even further, 
examining art-historical language with its gender-based terms such as 
“Old Master” and “masterpiece.” 

Nochlin’s essay also sparked an interest in studying artistic genres, 
such as the female nude and scenes of everyday life. Feminist scholars 
revealed the unspoken commercial and ideological interests vested in 


Chaucer and Edgar Allan Poe. He was also influenced by the 
Bible, and, as with so many artists on both sides of the Atlantic, 
by Wagners operas. In 1881, Ryder painted Siegfried and the 
Rhine Maidens (fig. 26.22), beginning at midnight after attending 
a performance of Wagner s G otterdammerung in New York, and 
obsessively painting nonstop for 48 hours. He continued to 
rework the painting until 1891, when it was exhibited at the 
Society of American Artists, an organization established, like the 
Impressionists’ “Artists, Inc.” (see page 871), to provide an alter¬ 
native exhibition opportunity to that of the academy, in this case 
the restrictive staid National Academy of Fine Arts. Here, we 
see again a variant of the femme fatale theme, as a sexual struggle 
is embedded in the legend of the alluring Rhine maidens who

these scenes. In particular, feminist art historians brought to light pre¬ 
viously ignored connections between depictions of women and late 
nineteenth-century attitudes toward gender roles and female sexual¬ 
ity. Quite often in the art of this period, images of women conform to 
simplistic (yet socially powerful) stereotypes of good or bad women. 
Mothers, virginal heroines, and martyrs represent the good women; 
prostitutes, adulteresses, and the myriad femmes fatales , such as 
vampires and incubuses, represent the bad. 

The second wave of feminist art history, which would continue 
throughout the 1 980s, was launched as early as 1 973 when British 
film critic Laura Mulvey used psychoanalytic methods to introduce the 
concept of the controlling power of the male viewer’s gaze. Studying 
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist imagery in terms of who gets to 
look and who is watched, feminist art historians exposed the opera¬ 
tions of power, visual pleasure, and social control. “Men look at 
women, women watch themselves being looked at,” the critic John 
Berger wrote in Ways of Seeing (1 972). For Berger, Western art reflects 
the unequal status of men and women in society. Griselda Pollock 
analyzed the “Spaces of Femininity” in Impressionist paintings, and 
examined the ways in which some respectable bourgeois women 
artists like Cassatt and Morisot depicted a very different experience 
of modern life from their male peers. And the working-class 
Montmartre model-turned-artist Suzanne Valadon, who grew up in the 
studios of Impressionists such as Degas, painted revolutionary nudes 
from the position of someone who knew what it meant to pose for the 
artist’s gaze. 

Beginning in the 1 990s, a third generation of feminist art historians 
broadened the scope of feminist art history to include gender studies, 
queer theory, the politics of globalization, and post-colonial studies. 
Nineteenth-century art remains fertile ground, however, for such inter¬ 
disciplinary study, and new feminist investigations of this period 
continue to shape the discipline of art history.

foretell Siegfried’s doom for refusing to return to them an all- 
powerful ring. Echoing the power of Wagners music, often 
designed to project mythic Nordic forces, the broadly painted, 
fantastical landscape erupts with seething trees and a wild curvi¬ 
linear sky, all seeming to emanate from the writhing forms of the 
maidens, who even seem to have at their command the supernat¬ 
ural pull of the moon. We sense uncontrollable power, reflecting 
uncontainable emotions, channeled through every brushstroke 
and distorted form. 

HENRY OSS AW A TANNER The African-American artist Henry 
Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) fell under the spell of Symbolism in 
Paris. Tanner studied in the 1880s under the liberal and support¬ 
ive Thomas Eakins in Philadelphia, becoming a Realist. With 
little hope of achieving artistic parity in racist America, he went to 
Paris in 1892, where he settled permanently. There, his work 
began to show the influence of Symbolism as he experimented 
with abstraction and pursued new themes, even producing several 
Salome paintings. Tanner was the son of a preacher, and his work 
is dominated by religious imagery, such as Angels Appearing 
before the Shepherds (fig. 26.23). The composition of this vision¬ 
ary painting is ingenious, for Tanner positions us in the sky with 
the angels. From this vantage point, we see the Holy Land: a 
breathtaking abstraction of lines and marks that nonetheless 
unmistakably contains hills, terraces, walls, and a city. We can

in what is otherwise a tonal symphony dominated by blue. Using 
rich, lush brushwork, Tanner dissolves the material world, 
making it ethereal and ephemeral, and as weightless as the trans¬ 
parent angels. Humanity is reduced to a speck in the vast scheme 
of the universe.

The Sculpture of Rodin 

The Symbolist desire to penetrate and portray the innermost 
essence of being had a parallel in sculpture in the work of Auguste 
Rodin (1840-1917). The most influential sculptor of the late nine¬ 
teenth century, who singlehandedly laid the foundation for 
twentieth-century sculpture, Rodins career started slowly. He 
was rejected by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, forcing him to attend 
the Petite Ecole, which specialized in the decorative arts. His big 
break came in 1880, when he won a prestigious commission to 
design the bronze doors for a new decorative arts museum. 
Although the project eventually fell through, Rodin continued 
to work on it right up to his death. Called The Gates of Hell 
(fig. 26.24), the 17-foot-high doors were inspired by Baudelaire’s 
Flowers of Evil and Dante’s Inferno from the Divine Comedy — 
indeed, at one point the thinker sitting in the tympanum contem¬ 
plating the chaotic ghoulish scene below was to be Dante. 
Ultimately, the doors became a metaphor for the futility of life, 
the inability to satisfactorily fulfill our deepest uncontrollable 
passions, which is the fate of the sinners in Dantes second 
circle of hell, the circle that preoccupied Rodin the most. It is the 
world after the Fall, of eternal suffering, and Adam and Eve are 
included among the tortured souls below. Despite Rodins 
devotion to the project, The Gates of Hell was never cast during 
his lifetime. 

Rodin made independent sculptures from details of The Gates , 
including The Thinker (fig. 26.25) and The Three Shades , the 
group mounted at the very peak of The Gates , which shows the 
same figure turned in three different positions. While his figures 
are based on familiar models— The Thinker , for example, recalls 
the work of Michelangelo, his favorite artist—they have an unfa¬ 
miliar, organic quality. Rodin preferred to mold, not carve, work¬ 
ing mostly in plaster or terra cotta, which artisans would then cast 
in bronze for him. We see where Rodin’s hand has worked the 
malleable plaster with his fingers, for his surfaces ripple and 
undulate. His medium, instead of being smoothed out, remains 
intentionally rough and uneven, unlike Canova, for example, 
whose marble aspires to an uninterrupted graceful perfection (see 
figs. 23.30 and 23.31). With Rodin, we are made to feel privy to 
the creation of the figure, as if watching God making Adam out 
of clay. This primal quality is reinforced by his figures’ nudity, 
which is less a Classical reference than a device to present an ele¬ 
mental form, stripped down to the very core of its humanity to 
expose primordial fears and passions. 

For the sake of expression, Rodin does not hesitate to distort 
his figures, shattering Classical notions of the idealized figure and 
beauty. Look, for example, at The Shades atop the doors of The 
Gates of Hell. Their Michelangelesque musculature has been yanked 
and twisted, endowing these specters with a form that is at once 
familiar and unfamiliar. These uncanny messengers have arisen from 
tombs and now cast their message of eternal gloom on the teem¬ 
ing humanity below. We can even see this distortion to a lesser 
degree in The Thinker. Here, massive hands and feet project a 
ponderous weight that underscores the thinker’s psychological

load, while his elongated arm is draped limply over his knee, 
suggesting inertia and indecision. 

Equally expressive is Rodin s use of fragments; works that are 
just a hand or a torso, for example. The part not only represents 
the whole, embodying its essence, but it serves to strip away the 
inessential and focus on specifics. In The Walking Man (fig. 
26.26), which he began in 1877-78 as a preliminary study for a 
sculpture of St. John, we see another example of this distortion. 
The anatomy was again inspired by Michelangelo, while the par¬ 
tial body evokes damaged Classical statues. By not including a 
head, Rodin removed the distraction of the face and any associa¬ 
tions it might carry such as identity and psychology, allowing him 
instead to stress movement, specifically forward motion. Initially 
just a study, Rodin eventually identified it as a self-sustaining 
work, recognizing that the headless, armless figure projected a 
powerful sense of humanity in its organic quality as well as pro¬ 
viding an endless wealth of visual delight in the handling of the 
plaster. He had a first version cast in bronze before 1888, when it 
was exhibited at the Georges Petit gallery in Paris. 

Rodin s emphasis on psychology can be seen in the Burghers 
of Calais (fig. 26.27), a monument commissioned by the Calais 
city fathers to commemorate six citizens who agreed to sacrifice 
themselves during the 1347 English siege of Calais, a major event 
in the Hundred Years’ War. In exchange for the execution of the 
six burghers, the English agreed to lift the siege and spare the 


town and the rest of its citizens. Rodin depicts the volunteers in 
crude burlap sacks and snakelike ropes trudging to their impris¬ 
onment and death. (Ultimately, they were freed.) Instead of 
courageous, noble heroes, he presents six men confronting death 
and displaying, among their emotions, fear, resignation, and 
anguish. They are not a united group but a chaotic mass, each 
alone with his thoughts. Massive distorted hands and feet, 
slumped bodies, and awkward gestures make the figures human. 
Rodin wanted the monument to sit on the ground in a plaza out¬ 
side the town hall, so it would appear that the figures were walk¬ 
ing from the building, thus allowing viewers to share the space of 
the burghers and experience their trauma. The ignoble, blunt 
monument embarrassed the town council, however, which hid it 
on a desolate site, mounted on a high pedestal. 

Clearly, Rodins preoccupation with expressing elemental 
fears and passions relates him to the Symbolist quest to plumb the 
depths of the mind. His thematic interests were stated as early as 
1864, and in some ways it is possible to view him as a late 
Romantic. What ultimately marks him as a Symbolist, though, is

his interest in the psychic toll exacted on the individual by civi¬ 
lization. Whether he is exploring the crushing effects of war or the 
emotional costs of creative effort, Rodin emphasizes the psycho¬ 
logical consequences of modern life. His ability to convey intense 
psychological states through forms at once familiar and abstract 
confirms his kinship with Symbolism. It was the hidden, inner 
struggle that Rodin, the Symbolists, and the nascent science of 
psychology sought to understand and render visible. 

ART NOUVEAU AND THE SEARCH 
FOR MODERN DESIGN 

In 1895, a German entrepreneur, Siegfried Bing, opened a decora¬ 
tive-arts shop called La Maison de LArt Nouveau (The House of 
New Art) in Paris. Bing had made a fortune importing Japanese 
art and furnishings, and now sought to promote the Japanese 
principle of total design: Every detail of an interior space should 
be integrated into a single style. Aiming to eliminate any distinc¬ 
tion between the fine and decorative arts, he hired famous archi¬ 
tects, artists, and designers to develop every detail of entire rooms 
for his shop, as well as to design individual products, including 
furniture, vases, tiles, and stained-glass windows. This new style 
was called Art Nouveau, after Bing s shop. Elsewhere in Europe 
it took on different names, such as the Jugendstil (Youth Style) in 
Germany and the Secession Style in Vienna. Though varying 
somewhat from one country to the next, the style, which is 
particular to architecture and the decorative arts, is usually char¬ 
acterized by abstract organic forms and arabesques. 

Art Nouveau can be seen in part as a response to William 
Morris’s Arts and Crafts Movement, and certainly the emphasis 


on handcrafted, finely designed products reflects this. The design 
products of Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933) were another 
important influence on Art Nouveau, especially his stained-glass 
windows (fig. 26.28) and glass lampshades with their organic 
motifs. Having a gemlike luster and the spiritual glow of medieval 
stained glass, Tiffany products are generally based on nature, 
depicting wooded landscapes, flowers, and trees. Coming on the 
heals of the Arts and Crafts Movement and anticipating Art 
Nouveau, Tiffany technically falls into neither category, and is a 
category unto itself. Tiffany’s New York store, however, was the 
inspiration for Bing’s La Maison de l’Art Nouveau. 

Important differences exist between the Arts and Crafts 
Movement and Art Nouveau. Unlike the Arts and Crafts design¬ 
ers, many Art Nouveau artists embraced mass production and 
new industrial materials. And while Art Nouveau designs are 
clearly organic, they are often purely abstract rather than based 
on identifiable botanical specimens, as is the case in Morris’s and 
Tiffany’s designs. 

The Public and Private Spaces of Art Nouveau 

Compared with dark, ponderous Victorian interiors, the buoyant 
naturalism of Art Nouveau was a breath of fresh air, exuding 
youth, liberation, and modernity It shared with Symbolism the 
element of fantasy, in this case biomorphic fantasy, which can 
especially be seen in architecture. Art Nouveau architects 
concerned themselves equally with exterior finish and interior 
space. Their typically complex, animated facades endow Art 
Nouveau buildings with a sculptural quality that engages viewers 
as they approach. This energy continues in the interior, for Art 
Nouveau spaces pulsate with a sense of movement—interior

decoration and furnishings give the impression of having germi¬ 
nated and grown in situ. This effect is often enhanced by the 
admission of sunlight through glass ceilings or skylights, lending 
the space the fecundity of a greenhouse where everything seems 
to have grown spontaneously. 

VICTOR HORTA The style began in Brussels with Belgian 
architect Victor Fiorta (1861-1947). Born in Ghent, Fiorta stud¬ 
ied drawing, textiles, and architecture at the city’s Academie des 
Beaux-Arts, and worked in Paris before returning to Belgium to 
start his own practice. In 1892, Fiorta designed the Tassel Fiouse 
in Brussels. The centerpiece of this is the ironwork of the stairwell 
(fig. 26.29), the malleable wrought-iron columns and railings that 
were shaped into vines that evolve into whiplash tendrils on the 
walls, ceiling, and mosaic floor. The supporting role of the 
columns has been downplayed by making them as slender as 
possible. In a play on the Corinthian capital, they sprout ribbon- 
like tendrils that dissolve into arches. The linear patterns extend 
to the floor and wall, a device that further integrates the space 
visually. Sunlight filters through the glass ceiling, heightening the 
organic quality of the space. The curvilinear patterning derives 
from a variety of sources, including Japanese prints and Gauguin’s 
cloisonnism (see fig. 26.12), although Fiorta’s undulating linearity 
would in turn influence contemporary art, as seen in Beardsley’s 
Salome (see fig. 26.20). Everything has an organic fluidity a 
springlike sense of growth and life, which has the effect of 
destroying the conventional boxlike quality of interior space.

26.30 Hector Guimard. Metro station, Paris. 1900 


HECTOR GUIMARD Art Nouveau next migrated to Paris, 
where its most famous practitioner was the architect Hector 
Guimard (1867-1942), who is especially renowned for designing 
the entrances to the Paris Metro, or subway, which opened in 
1900 (fig. 26.30). Like Horta, he worked with wrought and cast 
iron, patinated a soft, earthy green, but his sensitivity, while still 


organic, is quite different. If Horta suggests dynamic whiplash 
tendrils, Guimard evokes a lethargic prehistoric world, part plant¬ 
like, suggesting stalks and tendrils, and part zoomorphic, evoking 
praying mantises and dinosaurs. Even the lettering of the word 
“Metropolitan!” morphs into strange organic characters, irregu¬ 
lar, primitive, and foreboding. How appropriate for an architec¬ 
ture marking entrances to a new underworld. And how revealing 
that the style for a high-tech, machine world should be an escapist 
fantasy that is emphatically organic. Aside from his very public 
designs for the Metro, Guimard s practice was largely limited to 
private houses and apartment buildings for the haute bourgeoisie. 
He remained faithful to Art Nouveau even after it passed from 
fashion, around 1910. 

ANTONI GAUD I Among the most bizarre Art Nouveau cre¬ 
ations sprung from the wild imagination of Antoni Gaudi 
(1853-1926). Gaudi worked in Barcelona, the next and last major 
stop for the short-lived Art Nouveau, and his style reflects the 
fervent Catalan nationalism of the period, drawing heavily upon 
Mediterranean architectural traditions. His remarkable Casa Mila 
(fig. 26.31), a large apartment house, expresses his fanatical devo¬ 
tion to the ideal of “natural” form, one quite different from 
Horta s plantlike designs. On the one hand, the building conjures 
up the Spanish Baroque, the Plateresque (indigenous Renaissance 
architecture suggesting elaborate silver plate), and the Moorish 
mosques of southern Spain. On the other, it is pure nature. 
Believing there are no straight lines in nature, Gaudi created an 
undulating facade and irregularly shaped interior spaces (fig. 
26.32), in effect destroying the architectural box. With its huge

stone blocks, the exterior evokes austere seaside cliffs while the 
wrought-iron balconies resemble seaweed and the scalloped cor¬ 
nice mimics ocean waves. To twenty-first-century eyes, the chim¬ 
neys may recall soft ice-cream cones, but in 1905, they would 
have evoked, among other things, sand castles. These references to 
the seashore suggest Barcelona’s distinctive geographic, cultural, 
and economic relationship to the Mediterranean. Gaudf was a 
fervent supporter of Catalan nationalism, so Barcelona, the capi¬ 
tal of Catalonia, was especially symbolic for him. Perhaps more 
important, Gaudf was extremely religious, an ardent Catholic, 
and he viewed nature as a spiritual sanctuary and escape hatch 
from modernity. He spent the last decades of his life building an 
enormous Art Nouveau cathedral, La Sagrada Famflia, so vast in 
scale that it remains unfinished today. 

CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH Just as Gaudfs buildings 
evoke the landscape and culture of Catalonia, the work of the 
Glasgow architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928) speaks 
to a decidedly northern, Scottish sensibility. Mackintosh s designs 
are often labeled Art Nouveau, and he certainly began in this 
camp, especially adhering to Arts and Crafts values, and retaining 
organic qualities in his work throughout his career. As can be seen 
in his most famous building, the Glasgow School of Art (fig. 
26.33), built from 1897 to 1909, his work is infinitely more main¬ 
stream than Gaudf s, Guimard s, or Horta s. The facade is largely 
rectangular. Its austere windows, which hint at the Queen Anne 
revival style, dominate the building, making it look very geomet¬ 
ric. The grid of the windows is reinforced by the horizontal over¬ 
hang above the entrance. The entrance section evokes a Scottish 
baronial tower, within which is set an arched Baroque aedicula, or 
altar, with a Queen Anne oriel, or picture window, in a niche 
above. In other words, the building is an abstract presentation of

revival styles, but those styles are so reduced to a geometric 
essence that they almost disappear. Modern architects, especially 
in Vienna, would be especially inspired by this abstracting 
process. The only suggestion of the curvilinear Art Nouveau is in 
the eccentric, organic ironwork, including the railings and fences, 
the entrance arch with lantern, and the strange plantlike brackets 
used by windowcleaners. 

Mackintoshs interiors, for which he is most noted, retain 
more of a balance between the geometric and organic, as seen in 
his 1904 Salon de Luxe at the Willow Tea Rooms in Glasgow (fig. 
26.34). The door and walls have a frail linear patterning suggest¬ 
ing willow branches, and the backs of the chairs gracefully buckle 
and taper, while their leg brackets curve. A severe grid of verticals 
and horizontals, however, epitomized by the nine squares on the 
backs of the chairs, sharply organizes the room, which nonethe¬ 
less is quite elegant and refined. Regardless of labeling, 
Macintosh s design is certainly “new” and also total, encompass¬ 
ing every detail in the room, down to the door handle, all of 
which are beautifully handcrafted. While not the botanical and 
zoological fantasies of Horta and Guimard, Macintosh s vision 
equally dispatches the historical past and certainly charts 
strange territory, making tearoom guests feel as though they have 
passed through a magic door into a marvelous unidentifiable 
wonderland. 

AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE: 

THE CHICAGO SCHOOL 

Little did anyone know in 1871 that Chicago’s devastating Great 
Fire would launch modern architecture and make American 
architects for the first time the most advanced in the world. Once 
the flames of the fire were extinguished, the issue at hand was not 
just one of rebuilding. Chicago had been growing rapidly, putting 
a premium on real estate, and now there was a need to maximize 
land use by building vertically. This was made possible by the 
invention of the safety elevator, perfected in New York in the 
1850s and 1860s by Elisha Otis. Ambitious construction was 
delayed for ten years, however, due to the national financial col¬ 
lapse of 1873, which lasted through the decade. When rebuilding 
finally proceeded in the 1880s, it was dominated by young design¬ 
ers who had largely been trained as engineers with virtually no 
architectural background. This meant they were not hampered by 
strong preconceived notions of what buildings should look like 
and were open to allowing their structures to reflect the new tech¬ 
nologies and materials they employed. They abandoned the his- 
toricism of revival architecture and designed abstract structures as 
they allowed form to follow function. The buildings they erected 
were technically so complicated and the workload was so great 
that the major architects paired off into complementary teams: 
Burnham and Root, Holabird and Roche, and Adler and Sullivan. 
Of this group, only Louis Sullivan had attended architectural 
school, one year at MIT and a half-year at the Ecole des Beaux- 
Arts in Paris. 


Henry Hobson Richardson: Laying the 
Foundation for Modernist Architecture 

Designed by Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson 
(1838-1886), the Marshall Field Wholesale Store (fig. 26.35) pro¬ 
vided an intellectual challenge to the new generation of Chicago 
architects. Born in New Orleans and educated at Harvard, 
Richardson rose to international fame for his Romanesque-revival 
work, which became so renowned that the style was eventually 
named after him. Made of stone, his buildings were massive, bold, 
and highly textured. They were also quite simplified, emphasizing 
volumetric forms. With the Marshall Field Wholesale Store, a 
seven-story building that took up an entire Chicago block, 
Richardson s style evolved to its most refined form, one that 
moved beyond the Victorian Romanesque revival. The building 
was composed of weighty stone walls made of red granite and red 
sandstone, and because it took up the entire city block, it felt mas¬ 
sive, giving it a powerful physical presence. The scale and rough 
texture of the blocks as well as the dark hollows of the recessed 
windows added to the building s sculptural quality. 

The building was highly associational, or referential. The 
arches, especially when used by Richardson, recalled the 
Romanesque, although they evoked a fifteenth-century 
Florentine palazzo as well (see fig. 15.32). The three-tier layering 
of the building also calls to mind Beaux-Arts architecture (see fig. 
25.9), a reference to the rigorous architectural program 
of the Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts that established strict design

principles. These rules included a stylobate-column-entablature 
configuration, that is, a base, rise, and crown format. In the 
Marshall Field building, the stylobate, or platform, was repre¬ 
sented by the basement level, with the next two tiers representing 
the columnated level and the entablature. Despite parallels to past 
architecture, the building was remarkably abstract: There were no 
columns, piers, capitals, or entablatures per se. Instead the uni¬ 
form stone, despite its rustication, was like a continuous skin 
covering the building. This innovative design that abstracted his¬ 
torical style would pose a major challenge for Chicago architects. 

Louis Sullivan and Early Skyscrapers 

Richardson did not consider himself a Modernist, and he was not 
one. But the abstraction of the Marshall Field building helped 
spawn Modernist architecture. As important as Richardsons 
influence were technical developments. As the Chicago fire clearly 
demonstrated, iron is not fire-resistant; intense heat makes it 
soften, bend, and, if hot enough, melt. To avoid towering infernos,

it was necessary to fireproof the metal, enveloping iron, and 
shortly thereafter steel (which was only developed as we know it 
today in the early twentieth century) with terra-cotta tiles and 
later in a coating of concrete (modern concrete, called Portland 
cement, was invented in England in 1825). The insulation also 
prevented corrosion. 

An equally important technological development was the 
invention of the curtain wall. Unlike a self-supporting wall, the 
type Richardson used for the Marshall Field Wholesale Store, a 
curtain wall hangs from the lip of a horizontal beam at floor level 
on each story. Without this innovation, the base of the wall for a 
tall building would have to be extremely thick in order to support 
the weight of the wall above, severely limiting the number of 
floors. Furthermore, curtain walls allowed for entire walls to be 
made of glass, and with the development toward midcentury of 
plate glass, that is, large sheets of glass, it was now possible to 
design glass towers. The first extensive use of the curtain wall was 
in Chicago for the 1884-85 Home Insurance Building, which had 
a steel skeleton, and was designed by William Jenney, the elder 
statesman of the Chicago architects. 

The architect generally credited with playing the main role in 
developing the aesthetic implications of the steel skeleton into 
powerful architecture is Louis Sullivan (1856-1924). In 1880, 
Sullivan joined the Chicago firm of Dankmar Adler, which in 
1883 became Adler and Sullivan (Adler left the firm in 1891). 
Adler was the engineer, planner, and project manager who kept 
building construction moving forward, while Sullivan was the 
idealistic visionary who provided the design concepts. 

Sullivan s early masterpiece is the Wainwright Building (fig. 
26.36), erected in St. Louis in 1890-91. (Most of his major build¬ 
ings, however, are in Chicago.) Using the curtain wall, Sullivan 
designed a building that reflects the grid structure of the steel 
skeleton, although for aesthetic purposes he doubled the number 
of external piers, with only every other one having a structural 
beam behind it. The major problem for the early architects of sky¬ 
scrapers was how to design a building that rose so many floors, 
while maintaining a visually interesting exterior that did not rely 
on outmoded revival styles. Sullivan s solution was ingenious. 
Like Richardson s Marshall Field Wholesale Store, his building is 
largely abstract. The end piers are widened, as in Marshall Field, 
dramatically framing the building, and the spandrels (the deco¬ 
rated horizontal panels between piers) are recessed, both elements 
giving the building a monumental sculptural quality and the sense 
of a building evolving from a solid block. The seven-story colos¬ 
sal piers and the enormous one-story cornice add to this grandeur. 
Again, we see the Beaux-Arts stylobate-column-entablature con¬ 
figuration of the Marshall Field building, which feels even more 
Classical in the Wainwright Building because of the grid and 
absence of Romanesque arches. 

While the buildings exterior presents a compilation of 
abstract, geometric forms, largely reflecting the substructure, 
Sullivan did not hesitate to design terra-cotta panels for the cor¬ 
nice and spandrels that feature a pattern based on an antique 
rinceau motif (an ornamental vine, leaf, or floral design). Sullivan 


932 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 





















intended these biomorphic decorations to symbolize his belief 
that architecture should utilize new technologies to promote 
social harmony and progress and to be part of a natural organic 
evolution of the world. Sullivan fervently believed in the spiritual 
theories of Emmanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), a Swedish 
philosopher, theologian, and Christian mystic who preached that 
universal forces run through and unite all things, each of which is 
otherwise unique and an individual. His building reflects 
Swedenborgianism, which became popular at this time along with 
so many other nontraditional religions and cults. The decoration, 
for example, allowed Sullivan to distinguish the various parts of 
the building, giving each a separate identity (e.g., the upper story, 
the spandrels), and yet at the same time, all of these distinctive 
parts are tightly woven together into a unified whole, as suggested 
by the powerful grid of piers and spandrels. The flowering plant 
life energizes the building, reflects the vitality of the human ele¬ 
ment within, and relates both to the universal current flowing 
through all things. Although he was down-to-earth, practical, and

functional—it was Sullivan who issued the famous dictum that 
“form ever follows function”—he was also a visionary Symbolist. 
(See www.myartslab.com. ) 

Sullivan s style became considerably lighter, airier, and abstract 
by 1900, anticipating the floating, geometric, glass boxes of twen¬ 
tieth-century Modernist architecture. This style can be seen in the 
Schlesinger and Meyer Store in Chicago (fig. 26.37), which was 
originally a commission for the three-bay, nine-story section on 
the left but evolved into the twelve-story structure we see today. 
Now, the thin vertical piers actually reflect the skeleton behind, 
and the mechanomorphic facade echoes the structural steel grid 
behind it. The wall has virtually disappeared, giving way to glass. 
Instead of the enormous monumental one-story cornice we saw 
on the Wainwright Building, Sullivans top-floor “entablature” is 
actually a hollow recessed balcony, capped by a sliver of a cornice, 
which instead of being a weighty lid seems to be a floating piece 
of cardboard, in keeping with the airy lightness of the building. 
There is still a Beaux-Arts “base,” but it seems recessed (although 
it is not) because of the horizontal molding above, making the 
nine floors of horizontal windows seem to float. The first floor 
dissolves in a wild flurry of Art Nouveau plant forms that cover 
cast-iron panels (fig. 26.38), in effect unifying the building with 
cosmic forces. With the Schlesinger and Meyer Store, the aesthetic 
for the Modernist skyscraper had perhaps reached its finest

Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie House 

After studying engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Frank 
Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) worked for Sullivan from 1888 until 
1893. His sensitivity and strengths, however, could not have been 
more different. While Sullivan specialized in commercial build¬ 
ings, Wright s forte was domestic architecture, although his pub¬ 
lic buildings are brilliant. Sullivan s innovations were largely in 
facades, whereas Wright s were in space, including interior space 
and its relationship to the exterior. Wrights architecture, like 
Sullivan s, is based on nature, and his reputation was established 
with what are known as his Prairie Houses, so-called because 
their strong horizontal sweep echoes the planarity of the Midwest 
landscape where the homes were built. 

The crowning achievement of Wright s Prairie Houses, which 
he began designing in the early 1890s, is the Robie House (fig. 
26.39), designed in Chicago in 1908. The building was so shock¬ 
ingly modern it would take architects a good ten to 20 years to 
understand it and develop its implications. As can readily be seen 
from the exterior, the house is an abstract play of not only 
horizontals and verticals, but also of open spaces and enclosed 


volumes. The dramatic cantilevered roofs (which are not flat as 
suggested by our reproduction, but slightly sloping) define one 
space, while the floor of the terrace, or the balcony below, charts 
another. The interior spaces not only flow into the exterior, but 
into one another, for rooms, especially public rooms, generally do 
not have doors and four walls (fig. 26.40). 

Wright always claimed that his extraordinary ability to envi¬ 
sion complex space and design came from playing with the 
Froebel blocks that his mother bought for him at the 1876 
World s Fair in Philadelphia. Developed by Friedrich Froebel as 
part of his campaign to institute kindergarten throughout 
Germany, the blocks were designed to serve as a child’s first 
building blocks, and were part of a program that progressed to 
working with sticks and clay, folding paper, and weaving various 
materials. The Froebel “gifts,” as each stage was called, not only 
taught Wright to think in terms of abstract form, but also organic 
growth. Froebel was influenced by crystallography and conse¬ 
quently emphasized pattern making, not construction, with the 
pattern spreading out uniformly from a center row (the child was 
required to use all of the blocks). When it was complete, the child 
was encouraged to attach symbolic content to the shapes, relating

934 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 








the patterns to the living world of plants and the cosmos (suns and 
stars, for example). Equally important for Wright s development 
was a visit to the Japanese temple at the 1893 Chicago Worlds 
Fair. Here, he saw the dramatic projection of eaves, and severely 
geometrically shaped rooms that had sliding doors, which 
allowed one room to flow into another. Everything in a Japanese 
building was as tightly interlocked as in a Froebel project. 

As abstract and geometric as the Robie House is, the home 
resonates with nature and the organic. Even in our reproduction, 
the house, made of a horizontal brick manufactured to Wright s 
specifications (the face is l l A by 5 inches), appears perfectly inte¬ 
grated into the land, its lateral spread paralleling the surrounding 
plains. Wright thought of his architecture as organic, evolving 
much as a crystal develops or a tree grows. The Robie House, like 
many of his domestic designs, radiates from a large masonry fire¬ 
place, which Wright saw as a domestic altar to the “gods of 
shelter. ” The rest of the house develops organically from this ful¬ 
crum, with one room naturally flowing into another and into the 



exterior, which in turn is integrated into the surrounding land. 
This sense of growth can readily be seen from the exterior, where 
the lateral spread of roofs, terraces, and balconies seems to be in 
constant movement. The picturesque variety of overhangs and 
recesses creates a play of light and shadow that we do not nor¬ 
mally associate with architecture, but rather with nature. 

Wrights interior design also embraces this organic note. 
Reproduced here is the living room from the Francis W. Little 
House (fig. 26.41), perhaps his finest extant early interior. 
Influenced by William Morris’s Arts and Crafts Movement as 
well as the principles, if not the look, of Art Nouveau, Wright, 
when possible, designed every detail of his interiors, with every¬ 
thing hand-made and of the highest quality. Like his architecture, 
his furniture and designs are geometric, continuing the spatial 
interplay of his buildings. But the geometric designs that appear 
on the leaded stained-glass windows and ceiling grillwork are 
actually abstractions of plant and landscape motifs, and the palette 
of the room features somber, yet warm, earth colors. As much as

we may want to see early Wright as an abstract, machine-age 
thinker conceptually playing with spaces and completely break¬ 
ing with tradition, his theories and sensitivity are very much of 
the 1890s—he still has one foot planted in the Symbolist nine¬ 
teenth century that advocated a retreat from modernity into the 
arms of nature and its rejuvenating spiritual forces. 

PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE ADVENT 
OF FILM 

The primary preoccupation of photographers at the end of the 
century was the ongoing debate about whether photography was 
art. Complicating the matter was the dramatic increase in nonart 
photography. The invention of the half-tone printing process was 
one reason for this upsurge, for it resulted in photographs being 
printed directly in newspapers, magazines, and books using either 
lithographic or relief printing. It also brought about the rise of the 
picture postcard, which during the height of its popularity in 
1907-8 resulted in some 667 million postcards, most with pictures, 
being sent through the U.S. Mail. Another reason for the prolif¬ 
eration of photographs was the invention of dry plates, which 
replaced the awkward and impractical wet-plate process. Now, 
photographers could work faster and go anywhere. The process 
reduced exposure time to one-fiftieth of a second, and hand-held 
cameras with shutters were invented, making tripods unnecessary. 
Cameras could now record movement. And now cameras and 
prints were readily available at low cost to everybody. In 1888, the 


Eastman Dry Plate Company of Rochester, New York, intro¬ 
duced the Kodak camera. It came loaded with a paper roll 
containing 100 frames, which, once exposed, were sent back to 
the company in the camera for developing and printing. The 
company s advertisement declared, “You press the button—We 
do the rest.” Also appearing about this time was the single-lens 
reflex camera, which had a mirror that allowed the photographer 
to see the image in a viewer. Suddenly, everyone was taking 
pictures, and the word “snapshot” came into common parlance. 
Toward 1890, there were 161 photographic societies worldwide 
and 60 photographic journals. The medium became so popular 
that many newspapers carried an amateur photography column. 

Pictorialist Photography and the Photo 
Secession 

To counter the image of photography as a ubiquitous, mindless 
popular tool best suited for documenting the visual world, organ¬ 
izations sprang up dedicated to promoting the medium as high 
art. The first was the Wien Kamera Klub (Vienna Camera Club), 
founded in 1891, soon followed by the Linked Ring in London 
and the Photo-Club de Paris (1894). The Berlin, Munich, and 
Vienna Secessions, dedicated to breaking down any hierarchical 
ranking of the arts, showed art photography. In 1902, Alfred 
Stieglitz quit the conservative Camera Club of New York to form 
the Photo Secession, taking its name from the European secession 
groups. All of these photography organizations had international 
memberships, often with some of the same members, mounted

exhibitions, and published magazines. And they all promoted a 
Pictorialist aesthetic, placing a premium on a painterly, artistic 
look, countering the sharp focus that characterized postcard, 
stereoscope, newspaper, and magazine images and the single fixed 
focus of the Kodak camera. Photographs by art photographers 
were taken out of focus, like those of Julia Margaret Cameron, 
whose work experienced a resurgence of interest. Pictorialist pho¬ 
tographs were often highly textured, as a result of gum being 
brushed onto the printing paper before exposure or due to the use 
of a rough, pebbly paper. 

PETER HENRY EMERSON The British photographer Peter 
Henry Emerson (1856-1936) became a role model for Pictorialist 
photography, although ironically his own aim was to combine art 
and science by applying a scientific approach to the creation of the 
image: His pictures were meant to look scientific, not artistic. 
Emerson was a medical doctor, who abandoned the profession for 
photography in 1885. He was influenced by the German scientist 
Hermann von Helmholtz s theory of vision, which maintains that 
the eye at any one time can only focus on one area, with every¬ 
thing else becoming hazy. Wanting to make a realistic photogra¬ 
phy based on scientific principle, Emerson set out to produce 
images that replicated Helmholtz s optical premise. In Poling the 
Marsh Hay (fig. 26.42), the foreground woman is most in focus 
while the rest of the image is mildly blurred or indistinct. The 
picture appeared in Emerson s book Life and Landscape on the 
Norfolk Broads (1888), a folio of 40 mounted platinum prints, a 
photographic process that yielded an extraordinarily fine range of 
soft gray tones since the platinum lies directly on the surface of 
the paper, and is not embedded in albumen or a gelatin emulsion. 
Emerson was fascinated by the rural world of southeast England, 
where time seemed to stand still and hay was harvested by hand, 
not with the new steam-driven tractors. In this nostalgic image, 
we are presented with a Romantic view of an idyllic life of 
humans immersed in nature. Ironically, Emerson s scientific goal 
to realistically replicate the world as the eye sees it resulted in a 
poetic timeless vision, a soft-focused dreamworld of indistinct 
lush grays and of mysteriously floating darks and lights, such as a 
ghostly silhouetted tree and the light mystically shimmering on 
the canal and marshes.

GERTRUDE KASEBIER The international Pictorialists took 
their lead from Emerson and Cameron, among others, and simi¬ 
larly created painterly, dreamlike images. New Yorker Gertrude 
Kasebier (1852-1934) was one of the more prominent figures in 
the group, becoming a member of the Linked Ring in 1900, less 
than five years after taking up photography, and one of the found¬ 
ing members of Stieglitz s Photo Secession in 1902. Fleeing a 
wretched marriage, she enrolled in art classes at the Pratt Institute 
in 1889, and soon took up the camera with the intention of 
making art, although she supported herself through studio por¬ 
traiture. In Blessed Art Thou Among Women (fig. 26.43), an 1899 
platinum print on Japanese tissue, a thin paper, we see Kasebier 
displaying the hallmarks of Pictorialism: a soft, grainy image, 


slightly out of focus, and with a spectacular range of lush grays 
that only a platinum print can provide, made all the more delicate 
by being printed on a gossamerlike Japanese tissue. The mother 
wears a white Pre-Raphaelite-looking house robe and conspicu¬ 
ously stands before a religious image of the Annunciation on the 
back wall. The daughter, who is about to cross the threshold to 
go out into the world, is encased in a mandorlalike divine light 
created by the brilliant white that surrounds her, especially 
defined by the small gap between her and her mother. The scene 
has a spiritual quality, set within a sanctum dedicated to maternal 
protection and nurturing. In a modern urban society becoming 
increasingly fast, fragmented, and materialistic, Kasebier creates a 
tranquil domestic sanctuary based on, as the title suggests, the 


CHAPTER 26 PROGRESS AND ITS DISCONTENTS: POST-IMPRESSIONISM, SYMBOLISM, AND ART NOUVEAU, 1 880-1 905 937 










nurturing care of a mother. Kasebier’s image shares with Mary 
Cassatts The Child's Bath (see fig. 25.21) the same late nine¬ 
teenth-century feminist belief in the important role that women 
play in the development of children, and with Cameron’s Sister 
Spirits (see fig. 25.36) a female bonding or spiritual sisterhood 
designed to protect the rights and future of their gender. 

EDWARD STEICHEN Along with Kasebier and Stieglitz, 
Edward Steichen (1879-1973) also helped to found the Photo 
Secession. Steichen s early contributions to this movement were 
painterly and moody, his landscapes having the same poetic and 
mystical quality found in the Tonalist painting that was inspired 
by Whistler’s Aestheticism. His early style can be seen in his 1902 
portrait Rodin with His Sculptures “Victor Hugo ” and “The 
Thinker ” (fig. 26.44), a gum print. Using the painterly effect of the 
gum combined with the fuzziness of the focus, he created an 
image that looks more handcrafted than mechanically repro¬ 
duced, demonstrating that the photographer made aesthetic 
decisions that profoundly affected the meaning of the image. 
Picturing together the brooding silhouettes of Rodin and The 
Thinker , Steichen uses them to frame a brightly lit, phantomlike 
Victor Hugo. Clearly, Steichen identifies Rodin with The Thinker. 
One of the readings of the famous sculpture is that it is meant to 
represent Rodin and the daunting creative process and mental 
struggle behind the development of a work of art. This interpre¬ 
tation certainly accounts for this image, as suggested by the light 
striking Rodin’s “brain” and the emergence of Victor Hugo as an 
apparition, a figment of Rodins imagination. While in some 
respects Rodin is portrayed here as a Romantic genius, we also 
sense a Symbolist psychology at work—ideas do not gush from

his imagination and emotions, but instead they are the result of a 
long creative struggle, a prolonged search into the dark recesses of 
the mind. 

ALFRED STIEGLITZ Several of the Pictorialists in the Stieglitz 
circle photographed New York City, although paradoxically their 
images have a Romantic atmospheric quality more appropriate to 
landscape than the hard geometric look we associate with urban 
concrete and steel. By 1900, New York, not Chicago, was the city 
of skyscrapers, and as America attained global technological and 
financial superiority, New York and its “cathedrals of capitalism” 
became an emblem of this superiority. Even though Stieglitz 
(1864-1946) abhorred modernity and lamented the city’s “mad, 
useless Materiality,” he repeatedly photographed Gotham from 
the early 1890s up to 1910, as seen in The City of Ambition (fig. 
26.45) of 1910. Typical of Pictorialist images of New York, his 
pictures allow meteorological effects, such as snow, mist, steam, 
and fog, to upstage the buildings. In The City of Ambition , 
Stieglitz uses the Pictorialists’ characteristic soft focus. The 
metropolis looms large, but buildings are indistinct and in 


938 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 











shadow, softened by puffs of smoke and the clouds behind. Light 
shimmering on the water gets as much attention as the skyline, 
and we are very much aware of the glow of the sun setting behind 
the buildings. Stieglitz capitalizes on this light to orchestrate a 
beautiful symphony of gray rectangular forms harmonizing with 
rich darks and bright whites. He captures the awesome scale of 
the city, this “monster” as he described it, and he suggests, by 
immersing it in an atmospheric veil, that it seems to comfortably 
coexist with the awesome forces of nature. 

Documentary Photography 

Among the most powerful documentary photographs made in the 
closing decades of the nineteenth century were those chronicling 
the horrific working and living conditions of the modern city. 
Some of the best-known work was made in New York, a 
crowded, fast-growing metropolis teeming with indigent immi¬ 
grants and migrants readily victimized by unscrupulous landlords 
and employers. These masses were unsupported by social services 
and unprotected by the government. Conditions were especially 
appalling in the immigrant slums on the Lower East Side and the 
violent, lawless bars and brothels of Five Points, a district largely 
centering on the Bowery. Unlike the Pictorialists, whose tech¬ 
niques and subjects often softened the realism of their images, 
documentary photographers embraced the medium s capacity to 
produce direct, seemingly truthful records. Some documentary 
photographers felt that their work attained the status of art due to 
its apparent ability to convey “truth.” Others pursued documen¬ 
tary photography for commercial or even political ends. Jacob 
Riis numbered among the latter. 

JACOB RIIS Emigrating from Denmark in 1870, Jacob Riis (1849- 
1914) became a police reporter in the roughest neighborhoods of 
New York City, and was so appalled by the degradation and 
squalor he found there that he began photographing it in order to 
generate support for social reform. He made lantern slides of his 
images to illustrate his lectures, and published others in newspapers 
and magazines. Although Riis did not consider himself an artist, 
his works are undeniably striking. In order to create authentic, 
unposed, spontaneous images, he used a “flash,” a magnesium flash 
powder (the predecessor of the flashbulb), which allowed him to 
enter tenements, flop houses, and bars at night and instantan¬ 
eously take a picture, temporarily blinding his shocked subjects 
but capturing a candid image, as seen in Five Cents a Spot (fig. 
26.46). Here, he has burst into an overcrowded sleeping den on 
Bayard Street, creating an image that documents the greedy abuse 
of the homeless and leaves no doubt as to the unsanitary condi¬ 
tions that made such squalid, illegal quarters a breeding ground 
for disease. Riis published his photographs in a groundbreaking 
book, How the Other Half Lives (1890), which in part resulted in 
the bulldozing of the shanties in the Bayard Street neighborhood 
and the transformation of the site into a park. An army of social 
photographers emerged around and after the turn of the century, 
among the best known Lewis Hine and Jessie Tarbox Beals.

Riiss work has something of the look of a snapshot, an 
uncomposed, quickly taken photograph, and with the advent of 
small hand-held cameras, this look was common to amateur 
photography. The snapshot, like the documentary photograph, 
returns us to the issue of photography as art. Since 1890, virtually 
everyone in developed countries has accumulated albums, draw¬ 
ers, and boxes filled with snapshots, visual memories of the past. 
Are they art? In a sense, they are all art, as will be discussed in the 
next chapter when we study Marcel Duchamp. What is really at 
issue is whether it is good art, and the answer here is obvious. The 
vast majority of the billions of images are generic, banal, and 
predictable, and their value is largely personal, which is no small 
matter. And yet, there is that rare person with an extraordinary 
aesthetic sensitivity who, with little technical instruction, pro¬ 
duces remarkable images. 

HENRI LARTIGUE Such a person was Henri Lartigue (1894- 
1986), born into a wealthy French family who gave him his first 
camera when he was six years old. With this expensive toy, 
Lartigue proceeded to document his privileged family, filling 
some 120 albums with images that also captured the advent of 
modernity—automobiles and airplanes, for example. His images, 
such as My Hydroglider with Propeller , are often humorous, if 
not outright uproarious. Made in 1904 at the age of ten, the pic¬ 
ture shows Lartigue in his bathtub, his head surrealistically cut 
off at the neck by the water line and “floating” alongside his 
toy hydroplane, a toy based on a modern invention. Reproduced 
here is a later work, Avenue du Bois du Bologne (fig. 26.47), made 
at the age of 17 and part of a series of photographs the teenage 
artist made in one day of fashionably dressed women parading 
their wealth on the main thoroughfare in the famous Paris park

of the same name. Here, Lartigue has captured an amply fur- 
draped "animal lover” walking her dogs, their scrawny build 
humorously contrasted with her materialistic bulk, and their 
nervousness with the inanimate drooping skins of her hand- 
warmer. This wonderful composition, which has the voyeuristic 
quality of a Degas painting, also includes an automobile and a 
horse-drawn carriage—the new and the old. Its representation of 
affluence and the inclusion of a car have made it one of the icons 
of the Belle Epoque. 

Lartigue eventually attended art school and became known as 
a painter as well as a professional photographer, producing 
numerous portraits and society photographs. However, his boy¬ 
hood photographs went unknown until he was 69, and when 
discovered they were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York and in a large spread in Life magazine, touted not only 
for their quality but also because they captured the essence of the 
time. Their legacy also includes the introduction of humor into 
the medium, which would become a regular feature of twentieth- 
century fine-art photography. Meanwhile, it was not until the 
1990s that the aesthetic value of the anonymous snapshot was 
appreciated, driving collectors and curators to scour flea markets 
and estate sales for that rare remarkable work, that one-in-a- 
million shot with riveting subject matter or compelling aesthetic 
qualities. Called folk, vernacular, and sometimes "found” photog¬ 
raphy, it is today collected and exhibited by several of the world s 
best-known museums. 


Motion Photography and Moving Pictures 

In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904), who had made some 
of the most remarkable photographs of Yosemite the decade 
before, was hired by Leland Stanford, a business tycoon, politi¬ 
cian, and founder of Stanford University, to use photography to 
resolve one of the great questions plaguing horse trainers and 
artists for centuries: Do all four legs of a horse leave the ground 
when it is running? Setting up 12 cameras on a raceway and cre¬ 
ating a calibrated backdrop, he made a series of sequential photo¬ 
graphs (fig. 26.48) that once and for all answered the question: 
Yes. Artists ever since have used these images to draw a horse in 
motion, including Degas in 1879. Muybridge became a celebrity, 
and was invited to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia 
to make studies in locomotion, producing in the 1880s some 
100,000 images of nudes and animals. He published 781 plates in 
Animal Locomotion (1887). These motion studies convey a pecu¬ 
liarly modern sense of dynamics, reflecting, especially in their 
regularly repeated serial imagery, the new tempo of life in the 
machine age. 

The French physiologist Etienne-Jules Marey (1830-1904) 
saw Muybridge s horse-in-motion photographs reproduced in the 
magazine La Nature , and became obsessed with studying motion 
as well. He used a single camera, the lens open, placed behind a 
rotating disk with regularly placed slots. When a slot appeared, an 
image was recorded, so that a moving object would appear in a 
different position each time. Since he was interested in the 


940 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




26.48 Eadweard Muybridge, Untitled (sequence photographs of the trot and gallop), from La Nature , December 1878.

mechanics of locomotion and not the figure itself, he clothed his 
models in black body suits with a white stripe running along the 
length of the side. The models were then photographed in action 
against a black wall. Thus, only the white line of movement is vis¬ 
ible in his photographs (fig. 26.49). Though Marey saw no artistic 
merit in these studies, the results offer fascinating abstractions. 
And, as we shall see, they would influence artists who were inter¬ 
ested in rendering the movement of an object through space. 


As important, Marey s and Muybridges studies reflected a 
rapidly increasing interest in creating moving pictures. They were 
building on the popular parlor-game amusements that created 
images in motion. One device, called a zoetrope, consisted of 
slotted cylinders with a sequence of images of, for example, a 
moving horse on the inside. When spun and viewed through the 
rapidly moving slots, the horse would appear to be trotting. 
Muybridge invented an apparatus he called the zoopraxiscope,

which similarly used a cylinder, but the image was projected, like 
a magic lantern slide, onto a wall. Enticed by the implications of 
Muybridge s zooraxiscope, Thomas Edison in 1894 patented the 
kinetoscope, which consisted of moving images recorded on a 50- 
foot roll of flexible film that were viewed in a peepshowlike box. 
The show lasted 13 seconds. The following year, the French 
Lumiere brothers, Louis and Auguste, introduced the hand- 
cranked camera and electric film projector and produced the first 
moving picture, which lasted 25 seconds. It showed workers leav¬ 
ing their father s factory at the end of the day. 

In America, movie production was dominated by two com¬ 
panies, Thomas Edison and American Mutascope, which sent 
crews around the world to record various monuments, sites, and 
events. The pictures lasted only a few minutes at best and were 
presented in vaudeville houses in between acts. Filmmakers 
were now confronted by the same crisis that photographers had 
faced in 1839: What to film and how to film it. Generally, they 
focused on movement and action, as can be seen in Edisons 
1899 moving picture of a train crossing the Brooklyn Bridge (fig. 
26.50; to view the film New Brooklyn to New York via Brooklyn 


Bridge , No. 2, see hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/edmp.1734), filmed by 
a fixed camera positioned at the front of the first car. The 
Brooklyn Bridge film is revealing on many levels. First, it is a 
reminder that the early films, like those of today, had to appeal 
to a mass audience and present subjects of popular interest. 
Technological inventions and moving images of modernity, such 
as subways, skyscraper construction, the one million electric 
lights at the new Coney Island Amusement Park, and sleek ocean- 
liners and battleships coming into New York harbor, seem to 
make up a large portion of the existing Edison inventory from 
the late 1890s. Second, the film is remarkable for its modern 
attitude toward speed and space. As the train travels through the 
trussed structure, we become mesmerized by the rhythm of the 
wooden supports passing by and feel the speed of the electrified 
cars. Soon, the square structure becomes just an abstraction of 
squares within squares (fig. 26.50). As we shall see in the next 
chapter, objects, space, and time were understood much differ¬ 
ently in a modern mechanized era dominated by electricity, 
vertiginous 55-story office towers, high-speed trains, cars, and, 
soon, airplanes and moving pictures.

Toward Abstraction: 


The Modernist Revolution, 

1904-1914 



T he opening decades of the twentieth century saw the 

continued upward march of modernity. But, as in the preceding decades, 
artists both embraced and fled from progress. In some instances, they 
even clung to tradition while they purveyed the new, which we shall 
see, for example, in the work of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, two artists who 


successfully knitted together the new and revolutionary in style 
with the familiar and enduring in subject matter. The period is 
marked by landmark scientific developments that artists, like the 
public at large, could not ignore. In 1890, the German physicist 
Max Planck (1858-1947) proved that energy was not distinguish¬ 
able from matter, in effect beginning a line of thought that led to 
quantum physics. He showed that energy was emitted and 
absorbed in bundles called quanta, disproving the idea that energy 
existed in a stable, uniform state. Energy and, therefore, matter 
were in constant flux. This concept was especially pertinent to the 
discovery of radioactivity in 1902 by British physicist Ernest 
Rutherford (1871-1937). In 1913, the atom itself was further rede¬ 
fined when the Dane Niels Bohr (1885-1962) declared that it con¬ 
sisted of electrons traveling in specific orbits around an atoms 
nucleus, and that matter was not solid but instead in constant 
movement. But the greatest amendment to classical physics was 
proposed by Albert Einstein (1879-1955). Einsteins revolution¬ 
ary concepts appeared in a series of papers published in 1905 and 
1916, and they included his theory of relativity, which claimed 
that time, space, and motion were not fixed but all relative, espe¬ 
cially in relation to the observer s own position. The Newtonian 
world order, based on notions of energy and matter that remained 


Detail of figure 27.14, Vasily Kandinsky, Sketch I for “Composition VII. 


stable, was now supplanted by a more complex and contingent 
notion of the universe. 

Similar ideas emerged in accounts of human behavior by 
philosophers and psychologists. Henri Bergson (1859-1941), a 
French philosopher, was so influential in the first years of the 
twentieth century that he was well known even to the general 
public. Bergson postulated that we experience life not as a series 
of continuous rational moments, but as intuited random memo¬ 
ries and perceptions that we then piece together to form ideas. 
The world, therefore, is complex and fractured, or as expressed by 
the Harvard philosopher and psychologist William James (1842— 
1910), whose theories independently paralleled Bergsons, a 
“booming buzzing confusion.” Only intuition transcended this 
chaos. The mind, according to Bergson, was pure energy, an elan 
vital (“vital force”) that penetrated the essence of all things. While 
Bergson was philosophically redefining consciousness, the Viennese 
neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud 
(1856-1939) continued to refine his ideas of the unconscious 
through observations made during clinical practice, an approach 
that he felt gave his conclusions a scientific basis. Despite taking a 
different approach from Bergson, Freud likewise developed a 
model of human consciousness as fragmented and conflicted. 

Artists now pictured this new, constantly shifting, even frac¬ 
tured world discovered by scientists, philosophers, and psychol¬ 
ogists. Some artists, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, in a 
sense emulated scientists, treating their studios like laboratories

in which to analyze the very language of painting and where each 
creative breakthrough served as a steppingstone to the next as 
they sought to develop a new model of visual perception. Others, 
such as the Italian Futurists, embraced modernity and used new 
scientific discoveries, along with the radical stylistic develop¬ 
ments of Picasso and Braque, to express the psychology of mod¬ 
ern life and the impact of the technological wonders transforming 
the world. 

Other artists, however, especially many of the German 
Expressionists, sought an antidote to the cold, impersonal tenor 
and crass materialism of modernity and tried to invest contempo¬ 
rary life with spirituality. Continuing Gauguin s quest to find a 
spiritual peace in a so-called primitive world that was in tune with 
nature, many artists turned to the direct, more abstract vocabu¬ 
lary of tribal art as well as to children s, folk, and medieval art. 
Many of these artists were heavily influenced by Theosophy, a 
brand of mysticism that dates back to Plato, but that in the nine¬ 
teenth century took new form in the Theosophical Society, 
founded in New York in 1875 by the Russian emigree, occultist, 
medium, and mystic Madame Helena Blavatsky. Basically, 
Theosophists claimed all religions are the same, with each con¬ 
taining an essential component of one larger grand religion. 
Therefore, all had to be studied. More important, Theosophists 
claimed that all creation is part of one eternal life, a “Radical 
Unity,” and that everything is therefore mystically intercon¬ 
nected. For artists attempting to visualize the spiritual, the essence 
of which cannot be seen and is therefore abstract, the new 
stripped-down vocabulary of art was the perfect vehicle. 


FAUVISM 

The rise of Fauvism, the first major style to emerge in the twenti¬ 
eth century, is part of a colorist tradition that can be traced back 
through Van Gogh, Gauguin, Monet, and Delacroix to Titian and 
the Venetians. The Fauves, however, took the free, expressive use 
of color to new heights. Van Gogh and Gauguin had the greatest 
impact on the group, as is readily apparent in the work of Henri 
Matisse (1869-1954) and Andre Derain (1880-1954). Matisse was 
well aware of the aesthetic traditions with which he was wrestling. 
Trained in the studio of Gustave Moreau (see page 918), Matisse 
had received an exacting academic education at the Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts. He therefore understood the extent to which he was 
both continuing and breaking tradition when, in 1905, he pre¬ 
sented his latest pictures at the Salon d’Automne, or Autumn 
Salon, an important annual venue for vanguard artists established 
in 1903 by Matisse and Derain, among other artists. As exhibi¬ 
tions of avant-garde art proliferated in Paris at the turn of the cen¬ 
tury, the Salon d’Automne enjoyed a special status as a juried show 
where critics anticipated seeing the best of the new work. Few 
critics or other viewers for that matter were prepared for what 
they saw there in 1905. 

By that year, Matisse had not only moved beyond his academic 
training with Moreau, but had passed through an Impressionist 
phase in the 1890s, then a Cezannesque period, and finally a Neo- 
Impressionist stage. Strongly influenced by the Post-Impression¬ 
ists ’ use of color for formal and expressive ends, Matisse pushed 
the independence of color even further. His experiments proved

too radical for some. Art critic Louis Vauxcelles was so shocked 
by the “orgy of pure colors” that he encountered in the work of 
Matisse, Derain, and their colleagues at the Salon d’Automne , that 
he declared the pictures fauves , or “wild beasts. ” 

A classic example of the Fauve work exhibited in 1905 is 
Femme au chapeau (fig. 27.1). While the subject evokes a tradition 
of coloristic, virtuoso portraiture that stretches back to Vigee- 
Lebrun, Rubens, and Titian (see figs. 23.29, 20.3, and 16.33, 
respectively), Matisses use of color is totally new As with 
Impressionism, the color is intense, the image constructed of 
primary and secondary colors that look as if they have been 
squeezed directly from the tube. But now color does not have a 
representational function, adhering to a specific object. Instead it 
seems to have a life all its own, with patches of color sitting next 
to one another in what seems like random fashion. Along with the 
brushwork, color seems to reside uniformly on the surface of the 
image, reflecting Matisse’s careful study of Cezannes paintings. 
On the one hand, the background splashes of greens, yellows, 


reds, and blues appear to exist on the same plane as the head and 
body in the foreground, locking all together as in one continuous 
flat mosaic. On the other, there is just enough overlapping of 
representational objects, such as arm and torso, to create space, 
and of course there is the abstract pictorial space suggested by 
contiguous planes of color and brushstroke, as we saw in 
Cezanne. Matisse, however, has dispensed with Cezanne’s struc¬ 
ture and monumentality, and instead achieves compositional 
coherence by balancing intense, complementary hues applied 
with brash, seemingly spontaneous brushwork. 

Traditionally, art historians have placed the work of the 
Fauves in the category of Expressionism, but this is problematic, 
since the term generally applies to work displaying an outpouring 
of emotion—a tortured, anguished, or a pained state of mind. 
Despite the riot of color and chaos of brushstrokes, The Woman 
with the Fiat is not about the sitter’s or the artist’s psychology. 
The figure is nothing more than an armature for an exercise in 
design and the release of color from a naturalistic or documentary 
function. The same is true of Matisse’s landscapes and still lifes 
from this period as well. 

Andre Derain, likewise, understood painting as an intellectual 
rather than an emotional medium. His Mountains at Collioure 
(fig. 27.2), a subject located in the south of France, where he was 
painting with Matisse in 1905, may seethe with Van Gogh’s 
energetic brushwork and Gauguin’s arabesques, but Derain did 
not intend it to embody those artists’ spirituality or primitivism. 
Like the figure for Matisse, the landscape is just a vehicle for 
Derain’s complex play of joyous color and surface design. 
Derain’s overriding interest is in the formal —meaning abstract— 
qualities of image making, with special emphasis on bright color 
functioning in a nonrepresentational role. 

The Fauves were never an organized group. The term was 
applied by critics to artists, many of whom had been friends 
since 1900, who used bright color and happened to show 
together at the Salon d’Automne of 1905, where the similarity 
of their work was recognized. By 1908, Fauvism had disinte¬ 
grated. For Matisse, it was just one more stage toward making art 
that was, as he put it, “something like a good armchair in which 
to rest from physical fatigue. ” In other words, Matisse sought to 
use color in an abstract way that was beautiful, peaceful, serene, 
and sensuous. 

We can see Matisse beginning to move out of Fauvism in his 
1905-06 painting Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life) (fig. 27.3). 
This work shows the influence not only of Derain’s curvilinear 
patterning but also of first-hand experience with Gauguin’s paint¬ 
ings; Gauguin’s estate was being stored in Collioure, and Matisse 
visited the collection twice. The color in Le Bonheur remains 
intense and nonrealistic, but now it is contained in graceful 
arabesques. Matisse’s most innovative move here is to dispense 
with logical space and scale while increasing the abstraction. No 
matter how abstract and flat Derain’s and Matisse’s Fauvist pic¬ 
tures of just a year earlier are, they still project a rational progres¬ 
sion of space. Now, in Matisse’s work, that space is gone, as two 
enormous reclining nudes in the middle ground are as large as, if

not larger than, the pipe player and kissing couple in the fore¬ 
ground. Figures dissolve into one another and trees into sky and 
hills, so that it is nearly impossible to tell which sits in front of 
which. Reality gives way to a joyous abstract orchestration of 
colored lines and planes, which takes its hedonistic cue from the 
Classical idylls of ritual, dance, and music making of Puvis de 
Chavannes (see fig. 26.5). The pipes, garlands, shepherd, and sense 
of Graeco-Roman nudity evoke an archaic Classical world, the 
same world conjured by such French painters as Poussin and 
Claude (see figs. 21.7 and 21.8). 

Because of the intensity of its color, Le Bonheur is generally 
labeled a Fauvist picture. By 1907, however, Matisses palette, 
while still colorful, was subdued, becoming sensuous and serene 
rather than joyfully riotous. We can see this new sensitivity in his 
1911 The Red Studio (fig. 27.4). While the subject is again a con¬ 
ventional one—in this case, the artist s studio—in Matisse s hands, 
the theme takes on new import. On the one hand, reassuringly 
familiar objects appear, such as pencils, a collection of studio 
props arranged as a still life, and several of Matisse s own canvases 
and along the right wall his sculpture. On the other hand, The Red 
Studio offers a viewer a completely novel visual experience 
through the manipulation of color and line to radically redefine 
pictorial space. 

As the title indicates, the painting s keynote is the color red, 
which is like a flat window shade pulled through the entire canvas. 


Basically unvarying in tone, it momentarily becomes floor, wall, 
and tablecloth because of the white-line drawing, before popping 
back to the surface as a perfectly flat red shade. Even the white 
lines that delineate the table, high-backed chair, and wall, for 
example, and suggest recession and thus space, ironically rein¬ 
force the two-dimensionality of the image, for they are not 
painted lines. Rather, they are slivers of canvas that Matisse has 
allowed to show through. 

Matisse s slightly rust-colored red is highly evocative. It is 
enticing, lush, sensuous, soothing, and comforting, telling us with 
extraordinary efficiency and immediacy that this studio is warm, 
cheerful, and relaxing. The paintings on the wall seem to float 
on this red field, popping up to the surface of the image and 
asserting themselves as objects of pride and accomplishment. 
Matisse similarly highlights his box of pencils, plate, flowers, and 
chair, personal objects that must have been special to him. Only 
by dispensing with conventional space and volume, meaning 
realism, could Matisse push these objects to the fore and make 
them so prominent. The flat red field also serves as a foil that 
allows Matisse to create a wonderful syncopated rhythm with the 
paintings and other objects, producing a vitality that suggests 
artistic creativity, which complements the peacefulness of the 
room. Without entirely dispensing with the representational 
world, Matisse has used an abstract vocabulary to convey his 
soothing message.

CUBISM 

The second major style to emerge in the new century was 
Cubism, largely under the leadership of Pablo Picasso and 
Georges Braque. Cubism was not just an innovative style that 
sparked new ways of thinking about the look of art. It was 
also important because it introduced new ways of thinking about 
the purpose of art, which happened when its subject matter 
became not so much the still lifes and portraits that were embed¬ 
ded within Cubist abstraction but rather an analysis of the 
very language of painting. Picasso was the first to push the 
limits of the abstraction observed in the work of Cezanne, Derain, 
and Matisse. 

Reflecting and Shattering Tradition: 

Les Demoiselles d’Avignon 

Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) was born in the Spanish town of 
Malaga, on the Mediterranean coast, where he began his artwork 


under the direction of his father, who was a painter. At age 15, he 
moved to Barcelona and continued his training at the Escuela de 
Bellas Artes. He was soon a major figure in Barcelona’s art com¬ 
munity, working primarily in a Symbolist style. After roughly 
four years of shuttling back and forth between Barcelona and 
Paris and leading a desperate, abject existence, he settled perma¬ 
nently in Paris, moving into a run-down building nicknamed the 
bateau-lavoir (“laundry boat”) in bohemian Montmartre, the 
rural hill overlooking the city. The neighborhood was a center for 
the impoverished cultural avant-garde, and Picasso quickly 
became part of the group s inner circle, which also included writ¬ 
ers Max Jacob (1876-1944) and Guillaume Apollinaire (1880— 
1918). In 1907, Picasso shocked even his closest companions 
when he unveiled in his studio Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The 
Young Ladies of Avignon) (fig. 27.5). The paintings style departed 
sharply from Picasso s previous work. To his contemporaries, this 
large, frightening picture seemed to come out of nowhere. 

Of course, the painting did not emerge from an aesthetic 
vacuum. Among Picasso s sources were the great French history

The Myth of Primitivism 


E uropean countries began trading with Africa shortly before 1 600 
and the South Pacific (Oceania) in the late eighteenth century. But 
it was not until the nineteenth century that serious attempts were 
made to collect the art of these regions. Missionaries, traders, and 
government administrators sent home native objects, their activities 
increasing dramatically with the colonization of Africa and the Pacific 
in the closing decades of the century. The result of this collecting was 
the founding of ethnographic museums or ethnographic departments 
in fine art museums in major cities in Europe and the United States. 

Despite the fact that tribal art was housed and presented in muse¬ 
ums, including some that even specialized in antiquities, the works 
were perceived as artifacts, not art. It was ethnographic material. Paul 
Gauguin was the first artist to take a serious interest in tribal objects 
as art, incorporating Polynesian motifs and stylistic components into 
his paintings, prints, and sculpture, work that sought to escape the 
corrupting influence of decadent Western civilization by turning to so- 
called “primitive” cultures, which he perceived as more pure, natural, 
and unspoiled (see page 915). But it was not until about 1 905 that 
tribal art began to have a broad impact on contemporary artists. The 
Fauves, including Henri Matisse and Andre Derain, were among the 
first artworld figures to begin collecting the sculpture of Africa and 
Oceania, soon followed by Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brancusi, as 
well as the German Expressionists, especially Ludwig Kirchner, who 
are discussed in this chapter. 

The attraction of tribal art was twofold. First, much of it was abstract 
(although much was also naturalistic), reinforcing the abstraction of 
modern art. Its simplification of form, color, line, and composition and 
rejection of naturalism paralleled developments occurring in avant-garde 
art. For some artists, such as Picasso and Kirchner, the work was probably 
attractive for its expressionistic qualities, qualities that they perceived 
as frightening, even barbaric, and that could be incorporated into their 
work to express powerful emotions and a strained psychological state. 


Second, tribal art was alluring to the avant-garde because, as for 
Gauguin, it represented humanity in an unspoiled, more natural state, 
a perception that can be traced to Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s 
Enlightenment concept of the “noble savage” (see page 787). Before 
the discovery of tribal art, this return to nature and a simpler, more 
primordial time when humans were directly connected to universal 
forces was reflected by an interest in rural, even peasant, life, the 
Middle Ages, or Classical arcadias, as seen in the art or theory of 
George Sand, Rosa Bonheur, John Ruskin, the Pre-Raphaelites, William 
Morris, and Puvis de Chavannes (see Chapters 25 and 26). 

The process of deriving inspiration from tribal cultures is called 
primitivism, and the term is often expanded to include appropriations 
of other art forms perceived as simple, naive, and direct, such as 
Pre-Columbian, Native American, Archaic Greek, medieval, children’s, 
and self-taught art. The first major publication on the subject, Robert 
Goldwater’s Primitivism in Modern Art, came out in 1 938.The book 
said little or nothing about the nature of tribal art, which Goldwater 
loved, and presented it as primitive, even inferior, in comparison to 
Western art, ignoring the aesthetic and social issues embedded in the 
work that would demonstrate that it was as sophisticated, complex, 
and rich as European fine art. With the advent in the 1 960s of 
Postmodern philosophy (see page 1075), which argued that all 
viewpoints are biased and contain hidden agendas, scholars them¬ 
selves began to realize their own prejudices and stopped perceiving 
tribal art as primordial, as had the modernist artists. Postcolonial 
scholarship, the scholarship coming out of the African independence 
movement that began in the 1 950s, similarly attacked Western schol¬ 
arship. Particularly influential was Edward Said’s Orientalism (1 978), 
which argued that the Western mind, because it had always considered 
Islamic culture as the inferior “other,” could never responsibly report 
on North Africa and the Near East.

paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the canvas 
he chose for the work is uncharacteristically large, consistent with 
the dimensions of a painting destined for the traditional Salon. 
And the nude was a classic academic subject. An antithetical and 
more immediate influence was the avant-garde work of Matisse, 
with whom Picasso maintained a friendly rivalry until the older 
artists death in 1954. In the case of Les Demoiselles , he was 
responding to the spatial ambiguity of Matisse s Le Bonheur de 
Vivre , which Picasso felt compelled to upstage. These sources 
were not immediately apparent to visitors to Picasso s studio, and 
Les Demoiselles initially outraged Matisse and everyone else. But 
once understood, it provided inspiration for untold artists for 
decades to come. 

The title of the painting refers to the “red-light” district in 
Barcelona. Early studies show a sailor in a brothel, seated before 
a table with a plate of fruit and surrounded by prostitutes. In the 
final painting, the sailor is gone, but the theme remains, for we, 
the viewers, become the sailor seated at the table in front of the 


fruit, an age-old symbol of lust. Coming through the brothel 
curtains and staring directly at us are perhaps five of the most 
savage, confrontational nudes ever painted. Thematically, then, 
the picture began as a typical Symbolist painting about male lust 
and castrating women, a continuation of the femme fatale theme 
prevalent in late nineteenth-century art and literature, as well as a 
reflection of Picasso s personal sexual conflict with women and 
his intense fear of venereal disease. 

Instead of relying on conventional forms of pictorial narrative 
to tell his tale, Picasso allowed the abstract qualities of the 
medium to speak for him. For example, the formal qualities are 
threatening and violent, while the space is incoherent and jarring, 
virtually unreadable. The entire image is composed of what looks 
like enormous shards of glass that overlap in no comprehensible 
way Instead of receding, they hover on the surface of the picture 
plane, jostling each other. Sometimes the facets are shaded, as in 
the diamond-shaped breast of the harlot parting the curtain on the 
right, but Picasso has reversed the shading, in effect detaching the

breast from the body. Even more incomprehensible is the seated 
figure below her, who has her back to us yet simultaneously faces 
us. The table with fruit is tilted at such a raking angle that it would 
shock even Cezanne, who provided the most immediate model 
for this spatial distortion (see fig. 26.3) and was the subject of a 
major retrospective in Paris in 1907. The menacingly pointed 
melon sets the shrill tone for the picture and through its unsubtle 
phallic erection announces the sexual theme. 

The use of conflicting styles within a single picture is another 
disturbing quality. The three nudes to the left with their almond- 
shaped eyes and severe facial features were inspired by ancient 
Roman Iberian sculptures, which Picasso collected. But the 
frightening faces on the right are entirely different. At this point 
in the creation of the painting, or so the story goes, Picasso s 
Fauve friends took him to the Trocadero Museum of ethno¬ 
graphic art, where he saw African masks, providing the source for 
the ski-jump noses, facial scarifications, and lopsided eyes. The 


story seems logical enough. We know Matisse and Derain were 
already collecting African art, attracted to its abstract qualities 
and admiring how Africans had relinquished naturalism for the 
sake of expression. And Picasso and Matisse had known one 
another since 1905. Direct sources for Picasso s borrowings can 
be found in African sculpture, and the abstraction and “bar¬ 
barism” of the masks must have appealed to the artist s sensibility. 
(See The Art Historian's Lens , page 951.) 

Picasso adamantly denied the influence at this time of art 
negre , as African art was then called, although he would soon col¬ 
lect it himself. And, sure enough, in the early 1990s, art historians 
discovered that his source was possibly his own imagination, a 
claim based on doodlings in his sketchbooks that predate his 
exposure to African art. The striations, for example, were nota- 
tional marks for shadow, while the head of the crouching demoi¬ 
selle was actually the result of a witty transformation of a female 
torso into a face (visual double-entendres occur frequently in 
Picasso s art). But given Picasso s friendship with the Fauves, it is 
hard to imagine that he had not heard about and visited the 
Trocadero Museum before he finished the painting. 

Regardless of his sources, what cannot be denied is Picasso s 
willingness to look anywhere for inspiration, from the lowly 
source of his own caricaturing to African masks (then considered 
artifacts and not art), to Classical Greek sculpture, reflected here 
by the tradition of the monumental nude, which Matisse had pre¬ 
sented so differently in Le Bonheur de Vivre. But most important 
about Les Demoiselles is the new freedom it announced for paint¬ 
ing, for now line, plane, color, mass, and void were freed from 
their representational role to take on a life all their own. The 
picture laid the foundation for Analytic Cubism. 

Analytic Cubism: Picasso and Braque 

It may seem incredible that Les Demoiselles owes anything to the 
methodical, highly structured paintings of Cezanne, but Picasso 
had carefully studied Cezannes late work and found in his 
abstract treatment of volume and space the basic units from which 
to derive the faceted shapes of what became Analytic Cubism. 
Picasso did not arrive at this style on his own, however, and even 
seemed creatively stalled after Les Demoiselles. To help him move 
beyond this point, the emotional Spaniard needed an interlocutor, 
a rational steadying force, someone with whom he could discuss 
his ideas and experiment. This intellectual partner was the French 
artist Georges Braque (1882-1963), who conveniently lived 
around the corner from him in Montmartre. From 1908 to 1910, 
the two fed off each other, their styles developing from represen¬ 
tational pictures of fractured forms and space, as seen in Les 
Demoiselles , to shimmering evanescent mirages of abstract lines 
and brushwork, as found in Braques 1911 painting The 
Portuguese (fig. 27.6). Picasso and Braque were so intertwined 
during this period that their styles began to merge by 1910. 

The Portuguese is a classic example of the Analytic Cubism 
that had emerged in 1910. Gone is the emotional terror and chaos 
of Les Demoiselles. Braque arranged a grid of lines following the 


952 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



shape of the canvas and an orderly geometric pattern of diagonal 
lines and curves, all recalling Cezanne’s vision of a tightly struc¬ 
tured world. Despite being abstract, however, these shapes also 
function as signs or hieroglyphs. The circle at the lower center is 
the sound-hole of a guitar, and the horizontal lines are the strings, 
although Braque used the same sign to indicate fingers, a con¬ 
founding or visual punning of objects that is characteristic of 
Cubism and a declaration that art is a signing system, like lan¬ 
guage. The stenciled letters and numbers come from a poster that 
probably read “Grand Bal” and listed the price of admission (10 
francs 40 centimes). The lines and shadows suggest arms, shoul¬ 
ders, and the frontal or three-quarter pose of a figure that tapers 
toward the head. In the upper right, we see lines that suggest rope 
and a pier. By providing these subtle visual clues, Braque prompts 
the viewer to recognize that the painting shows a guitar player, in 
a Marseille bar, with a view of the docks through a window. As 
with Les Demsoiselles , we find a conventional subject—a genre 
scene—presented in a radical new artistic language. The light that 
floods the picture and falls on individual facets seems real or nat¬ 
uralistic but fails to create coherent space and volume. Ultimately 
everything is in a state of flux without absolutes, including a sin¬ 
gle interpretation of reality. The only reality is the pictorial world 
of line and paint, which Braque is telling us is as much a language 
as the hieroglyphic signs that he has embedded in his image. 

In a 1909 review of Braque s earlier work, Louis Vauxcelles, 
who had named Fauvism, labeled the paintings “Cubism,” influ¬ 
enced by Matisse s description of earlier Cubist works as appear¬ 
ing to be made of little cubes. The word was then applied to the 
analytic experiments of Braque and Picasso. 

Synthetic Cubism: The Power of Collage 

To focus on structure, line, and space, Picasso and Braque painted 
monochrome images, thus removing the problem of color from 
their Analytic Cubism. This situation changed in 1912, however, 
when they began working in collage, pasting flat objects, gener¬ 
ally paper, onto canvas. Picasso made the earliest known example 
in May 1912, when he glued onto the surface of a Cubist painting 
a sheet of imitation chair caning, a product not unlike contact 
paper. (These oilcloth sheets with a chair-caning pattern printed 
on them were normally pasted on wood as an inexpensive way to 
repair a broken seat.) This device allowed him to complicate 
notions of the real and the illusionistic, for the chair caning was 
simultaneously real—a piece of real imitation chair caning—and 
illusionistic, a picture of chair caning. Clearly, collage allowed 
Picasso to continue parsing the language of painting, 

Picasso and Braque realized immediately the broader implica¬ 
tion of collage—the pasted image now literally sat on top of the 
canvas, a statement Matisse had made a year earlier about painted 
imagery in The Red Studio when he revealed the canvas to empha¬ 
size how paint sat atop its surface. Once and for all, the 
Renaissance conception of the picture plane as a window into an 
illusionistic world was shattered. Instead of a window, the picture 
surface became a tray on which art was served. Art occurred in 


front of, not behind, the canvas, a fact Edouard Manet had 
implied some 50 years earlier (see page 868). 

Collage completely changed the way in which Braque and 
Picasso made their images. Instead of breaking down or abstract¬ 
ing an object into essential forms, the artists now synthetically 
constructed it by building it up or arranging it out of cut pieces of 
paper, hence the name Synthetic Cubism. Constructing the image 
out of large, flat shapes meant that they could introduce into 
Cubism a variety of textures and colors, as seen in Picasso s 
Guitar , Sheet Music , and Wine Glass (fig. 27.7) of 1912. Because 
music is abstract, like their art, it became a favorite theme for the 
Cubists, who wished to establish parallels between the two art 
forms. Picasso built his composition on a background of real 
wallpaper that, like the imitation chair caning used earlier, serves 
as a visual pun on illusion and reality. 

Picasso puns with solid forms and intangible space as well.

but appears as a solid circle of paper, contrasts with the wine 
glass in the Analytic Cubist drawing, which should be three- 
dimensional and solid but instead consists of lines on a flat piece 
of off-white paper that has more physical presence than the drawn 
glass. Picasso even tells us he is punning, for he has cropped the 
newspaper collage at the bottom to read “EE JOU,” a shortening 
of Le Journal , or “newspaper,” which in French sounds like the 
verb jouer , meaning “to play. ” The headline for the article is “La 
Bataille s’est engage” which translates as “The Battle Has 
Started,” and refers to the violent war then raging in the Balkans, 
with Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro fighting for inde¬ 
pendence against the Ottoman Empire (see map 27.1). Picasso 
uses the announcement to signal the friendly rivalry between 
himself and Braque. Possibly, he is subtly contrasting the sensual 
pleasure of his still life and its implied comfortable bourgeois 
lifestyle with the horrendous suffering of the Balkan conflict, in 
effect commenting on French or middle-class indifference to the 
tragedy occurring to the east. 

The logical peak of Cubism occurred when Picasso extended 
Synthetic Cubism to sculpture and created the first construction, 
a three-dimensional assemblage of materials. Although his earliest 
construction was made in 1912 (and evidence suggests Braque had 
made some even earlier), Picasso did not produce a large number 
of these sculptures until 1914-15. Most were musical instruments, 
such as Violin (fig. 27.8) of 1915. Instead of pasting paper onto 
canvas, he assembled flat or slightly bent sheets of painted metal 
into a low relief. Just as he had for painting, he now redefined 
sculpture. Instead of being carved, chiseled, or molded, his sculp¬ 
ture was assembled, and, unlike most sculpture since the 
Renaissance, it was painted. He used paint perhaps with a bit of 
irony, since the cross hatching used to represent shading in his 
paintings is unnecessary for a sculpture, the three-dimensional 
form not requiring illusionistic shadow. Again Picasso puns with 
his medium as he comments on the language of art, describing the 
properties of sculpture and how it functions. While the subject of 
the work is a violin, we would never know this for certain were it 
not for the title. Recognizing a violin is not the issue, however, for 
Picasso is more concerned with creating a visual equivalent to 
music—here a staccato rhythm of shape, color, and texture—that 
transforms the individual metal components into playful musical 
notes that we can almost hear. 

The outbreak of war in 1914 disrupted daily life, bringing an 
end to the brilliant visual game between Picasso and Braque. By 
then, the two artists had completely transformed painting and 
sculpture, undermining some 700 years of tradition by destroying 
notions about what art forms could be. Conventional systems for 
representing perspectival space were demolished, and now line 
and color conveyed formal or expressive content instead of serv¬ 
ing to duplicate observed reality. 

Braque and Picasso sparked a revolution in our perception 
of reality as radical as those of Freud and Einstein. Music and 
literature were undergoing similar transformations. For example, 
Russian composer Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) changed the face 
of music with his primitive, rhythmic ballet score The Rite of

Spring , first performed in 1913 in Paris, where it caused a riot 
because people found it merely cacophonous noise that aban¬ 
doned all musical rules. Irish author James Joyce (1882-1941) 
similarly dismantled and restructured the novel in Ulysses , begun 
in 1914, in which he disrupted the continuity of the narrative 
by giving a reader multiple views of the characters’ personalities 
and psychologies. 

Especially close to the Cubists, however, was the writer 
Gertrude Stein (1874-1946), who with her brother Eeo amassed 
an astonishing collection of works by Picasso and Matisse, which 
they displayed in their Paris apartment. Stein is famous for such 
phrases as “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose” or “Out of kindness 
comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, 
out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cat¬ 
tle. ” Inspired by Cezanne, her novels and poems have a stream- 
of-consciousness and fractured abstract quality meant to evoke 
“the excitingness of pure being.” Eike Cubism, Steins rhythmic 
“word-paintings” deny any absolutes. 


954 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




THE IMPACT OF 
FAUVISM AND CUBISM 

Matisse s and Picasso s liberation of color and line from illusionis- 
tic roles marked important steps in the development of modern 
art. As innovative as their achievements were, their interests and 
sensibilities during these years were limited. Their works were 
rational, intellectual, and pleasurable, and they focused on such 
traditional subjects as still life, portraiture, and the figure. Yet they 
provided a new artistic vocabulary for artists with very different 
interests and concerns, artists who used this new language to proj¬ 
ect powerful emotions, spirituality, and the intensity of modernity. 

German Expressionism 

The long tradition of Expressionism in German art extends back 
to the grotesque physical and psychological tensions of such 
Renaissance artists as Matthias Griinewald (see fig. 18.10) and 
Albrecht Diirer (see fig. 18.14). German Expressionism surfaced 
as a cohesive movement toward 1905, and although it encom¬ 
passed a range of issues and styles, it can be characterized as tor¬ 
tured, anguished, brutally primitive, or passionately spiritual, 
reflecting elemental cosmic forces.

A precursor of the first German Expressionist movement is 
Paula Modersohn-Becker (1876-1907), whose career was cut 
short by her early death at the age of 31. Her artistic activity was 
limited to two mature years, during which she produced remark¬ 
able pictures that promised a brilliant future. In 1898, she settled 
in the commune of Worpswede, a haven for artists and intellectu¬ 
als seeking escape from modern urban life, just outside Bremen in 
north Germany. There, she befriended two major Symbolist writ¬ 
ers, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) and the novelist Carl 
Hauptmann (1862-1946), both of whom urged her to seek the 
spiritual in her art and to reject the naturalistic. Modersohn- 
Becker visited Paris regularly, and in 1905-06 she was especially 
influenced by exhibitions of works by Gauguin and Cezanne. 

The emergence of her individual style is represented by her 
1913 Selbstbildnis , Halbakt mit Bernsteinkette (Self-Portrait with 
an Amber Necklace) (fig. 27.9). In this radical picture, the artist 
presents herself nude. With this gesture, Modersohn-Becker 
reclaims the nude female form for women, endowing it with a cre¬ 
ative vitality and meaning that challenges the tradition of the pas¬ 
sive nude Venuses and bathers popular since the Renaissance. The 
artist presents herself as an emblem of fertility, an earth-goddess, 
from which all life flows. Showing herself frontally, like an icon, 
she reduces her contours to a Gauguin-like curvilinear simplicity. 
Her awkward yet charming pose suggests the primitive, recalling 
especially Gauguins Tahitian women (see fig. 26.13). Her amber 
necklace even resembles a lei, or garland of flowers. She 
poignantly displays two small flowers, symbols of fertility, which 
she has colored and shaped similarly to her nipples, drawing a 
parallel between the two. Also symbolic of fecundity is the gar¬ 
den that she stands in. A celestial blue halo deifies her and rein¬ 
forces her elemental presence. What is revealing about the image 
is Modersohn-Becker s German primitivism, which differs so rad¬ 
ically from that of Gauguin. There is a cultivated crudeness 
throughout the picture, reflected in the pasty application of paint, 
particularly in the masklike face and neck, and the awkward ges¬ 
tures, especially of her left hand. It appears as well in the ungainly 
flat ear and coarse fingers of the right hand. Despite the beautiful, 
colorful palette, we sense a raw, primal energy and an earthiness, 
characteristics of much German Expressionism. 

DIE BRUCKE (THE BRIDGE) Scholars generally assert that 
German Expressionism began with Die Briicke (The Bridge), a 
group conceived in 1903 when four Dresden architecture stu¬ 
dents, including Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938) and Erich 
Heckel (1883-1970), decided to form an art alliance “to clear a 
path for the new German art.” In 1905, the group officially 
formed and went public with no artistic program other than to 
oppose “older well-established powers” and to create a “bridge” 
to the future. Like so many progressive Germans, their vision was 
formed by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). In 
his most famous book, Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-85), 
Nietzsche called for the rise of an Ubermensch , or “superhuman,” 
a youthful noble of superior intellect, courage, fortitude, creativ¬ 
ity, and beauty who would dominate the inferior masses huddling 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 955 



safely in the conventional, restrictive past. This strong-willed 
Ubermensch would be the “bridge” that would lead the world 
into a glorious future of new ideas. 

The initial problem confronting these largely self-taught 
artists, who shared a communal studio in a former butcher s shop, 
was to find appropriate subject matter and a way to express it. 
Initially they focused on the unsettling psychology of modern 
Germany and turned to intense color to convey their message. 
Kirchner, the leader of Die Briicke, was perhaps the first to 
mature artistically, about 1907, as seen in his Street , Dresden (fig. 
27.10) of 1908. The group s love of Van Gogh and their recent dis¬ 
covery of Matisse are reflected in the intense Fauvist color liber¬ 
ated from a representational role. As important is the impact of 
Edvard Munch (see fig. 26.19), who exhibited throughout 
Germany and often resided in Berlin after 1892. The disturbing 
psychological undertones and arabesque patterning are decidedly 
Munch-like, and Kirchner s crowded street evokes a claustropho¬ 
bic anxiety worthy of the Norwegian symbolist. Like most 
Munch images, this one focuses on sexual confrontation. 
Wraithlike women stare out. One, dressed in yellow, lifts her 
dress to reveal her petticoat. Searing pinks, yellows, and oranges 
contrast with electrifying blues and greens, creating a disturbing 
dissonance and sexual excitement. This picture could never be 
mistaken for a Matisse. For the Bridge artists, prostitutes were 
emblems of the decadence of urban life, embodying the immoral¬ 
ity and materiality of the city. 

In 1906, the Berlin painter Emil Nolde (1867-1956) had a 
one-person show at the Galerie Arnold in Dresden. The Briicke 
artists were so captivated by Nolde s powerful use of color that 
they invited him to join the group. Older than the other members,

he lasted only a year, for his brooding nature and highly personal 
style were not really compatible with the groups communal 
mission. Still, his preoccupation with intense emotion and color 
conformed to the direction in which the group was heading, in 
part due to his influence. In 1909, after recovering from a serious 
illness, he made a series of religious pictures, including The Last 
Supper (fig. 27.11). Nolde claimed that in this picture he “followed 
an irresistible desire to represent profound spirituality, religion,

and tenderness.” This painting, created in a passionate fervour 
over several days, is about emotion, his own as well as that of 
Jesus and the apostles. Nolde crowds the figures and presses 
them to the surface of the picture plane, making their passions 
ours. A somber yet ardent red dominates, contrasted by its 
complement green and laced with yellows and blues, making the 
surface appear to burn with emotion. He used bold slabs of paint 
to crudely construct faces and bodies, an effect difficult to see in 
reproductions. A brutal angularity occasionally appears in chins 
and noses, and color patterns have jagged edges, as in the hair 
of the foreground figures. 

At first the faces look like masks and are almost grotesque. 
These are not Ensor masks (see fig. 26.18), however, nor are they 
masks at all. The distortions and strident gestures, both figural 
and painterly, underscore the expressive power of the scene. The 
rawness of the figures, a quality we saw in Modersohn-Becker, 
enhances the direct emotional force. It also makes the protago¬ 
nists appear more human and earthy, paradoxically more real 
despite their sketchiness. By this point in his career, Nolde regu¬ 
larly visited the Volkerkundemuseum in Berlin, drawn to the 
spirituality and expressionism of the tribal artifacts displayed 
there. Here, we can sense his adoption of the abstracting, simpli¬ 
fication, and directness found in much African art and see him 
using it to create similar powerful psychological effects. 

The ranks of Die Briicke gradually expanded to eight or nine 
artists, but by 1909, the members began moving one by one to 
Berlin. There, they found a more sophisticated art scene, domi¬ 
nated by Herwarth Waldens avant-garde art publication Der 
Sturm , begun in 1910, a concept he had expanded into a gallery of 
the same name by 1911. By that year, all the Briicke artists had 
relocated, although the group did not disband until 1913. Heavily 
influenced by Cubism, their style began to change as well. Most 
abandoned the undulating contours of Munch and the Jungendstil 
(German Art Nouveau) and embraced a fractured planarity and 
geometric linearity. 

This new style that emerged toward 1910 can be seen in Erich 
Heckel s A Crystal Day (fig. 27.12) of 1913. Although Die Briicke 
artists retained the linear look of Cubism, they generally used it 
to create psychological tension rather than a complicated pictorial 
space. In this work, Heckel uses Cubist line and fracturing of 
space to portray abstract, universal ideals. While Kirchner por¬ 
trayed the psychologically debilitating and moralistically bank¬ 
rupt side of modernity, Heckel presented the antidote, a 
Rousseauian elemental, almost primitive, unification with nature 
and its universal forces. In A Crystal Day , Heckel captures cosmic 
energy through the power of his long streaking lines that, espe¬ 
cially in sky and lake, look like a painterly abstract Cubist 
composition. Similar asymmetrical jagged shapes are echoed 
throughout, locked in a tight mosaic. Even the angular figure, 
reduced to a simplified form and vaguely reminiscent of the 
African sculpture the group so admired for what it considered its 
primal directness, is closely woven into the linearity of the land. 
Heckel gives us the feeling of a common life force surging 
through all of nature, binding everything together. This reading is

confirmed by the clouds and their reflections in the water, which 
have been transformed into the crystals of the title and reflect the 
belief that crystals held spiritual properties, a perception popular¬ 
ized by the poet Paul Scheerbart in 1914 (see page 979). 

In their quest to create a nationalistic art, Die Briicke artists 
revived the printmaking technique of woodcut, favored by 
German artists during the early Renaissance. (See Materials and 
Techniques , page 958.) Adding to the medium s attraction was its 
expressive rawness—one can sense the grain of the wood, which 
gives not only a stridency but also an earthly, organic feeling to 
the images. These qualities can readily be seen in Kirchner s Peter 
Schlemihl: Tribulations of Love (fig. 27.13) of 1915, one of a series 
Kirchner created to illustrate the prose tale Peter SchlemihTs 
Wondrous History (1814) by Adelbert von Chamisso (1781 -1838), 
which tells the tale of a man who sells his shadow, thus his soul, 
for a pot of gold. This colored woodcut shows the use of the 
ambiguous space of Cubism to project the invisible inner work¬ 
ings of the mind and to juxtapose that with the representational 
world. Here, we see a man next to a manifestation of his psycho- 
sexual conflict. Spatial dislocation, a splintering sharpness to the 
edges, a chaotic composition, and the touches of emotion-evoking 
color (a passionate violent red and a chilling melancholy blue)— 
all abstract qualities—create an unsettling and distressing image. 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 957 









MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 


The Woodcut in German Expressionism 


S ome of the best-known European artists in the fifteenth and six¬ 
teenth centuries practiced the printmaking medium of the wood- 
cut, but by the early nineteenth century this method had been eclipsed 
by new commercial printing technologies, such as wood engraving and 
lithography. These technologies produced images of great detail that 
could be executed rapidly and mass-produced. In the late nineteenth 
century, however, European painters and sculptors returned to the 
woodcut as an artistic medium precisely because it produced a crude, 
unsophisticated look in contrast to the slick techniques of modern 
image reproduction. 

Japanese woodblock prints were the elaborate product of a series of 
designers, block cutters, and printers, and Europeans in the mid-nine¬ 
teenth century avidly collected them. In the 1890s, Edvard Munch and 
Paul Gauguin reinvented a very different form of the woodblock print, 
or woodcut, as did such German Expressionists as Ernst Ludwig 
Kirchner (see fig. 27.1 3) and, somewhat later, Kathe Kollwitz in the 
early 1 900s. Their simplified, hand-made process contributed to the 
planar effect of flat, simplified shapes, which can evoke strong 


emotional tensions. Unlike the division of labor characteristic in the 
production of Japanese prints and in those of northern Renaissance 
artists such as Albrecht Durer, these modern artists designed, cut, and 
printed the woodcuts themselves. They could thus exploit unforesee¬ 
able expressive qualities in the wood grain that became evident only 
during the carving process. Munch developed an influential technique 
in which he cut the block into jigsaw pieces that were inked 
individually, reassembled, and printed, resulting in a multicolor print 
produced in one pull through the press. The Kirchner woodcut seen in 
figure 27.1 3 was printed from two blocks. 

Although many prints by these artists appear spontaneous or per¬ 
haps haphazard, they are in fact the result of deliberate forethought: 
The block had to be cut in such a way that the wood remaining in 
relief, when rolled with ink, produced the sought-after image. There 
was no room for error, for the artist had not only to plan the positive 
and negative spaces but also to reverse his intended picture because, 
when printed, the impression created is a mirror image of the original 
woodblock design. 



Kirchner, like Heckel, displays a Briicke reliance on the expressive 
distortions of African sculpture, seen especially in the sharp angu¬ 
larity and faceting of the mans face. 

DER BLAUE REITER (THE BLUE RIDER) The second major 
German Expressionist group, Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), 
developed in Munich, in southern Germany. It officially lasted 
but four months, from December 1910 to March 1911. Like their 
Briicke counterparts, the artists associated with Der Blaue Reiter 
drew on art forms from Western art history as well as non- 
Western and folk-art traditions to create images that reveal their 
skepticism toward modern, industrial life. The group focused on 
expressing a spirituality they believed resided beneath the surface 
of the visual world. 

The key figure in Der Blaue Reiter was the Russian artist 
Vasily Kandinsky (1866-1944). He left Moscow in 1896 to 
study art in Munich and brought with him Russian influences, 
namely the spirituality of native religious icons and the robust, 
emotional colors of folk art. His interest in folk culture was 
rekindled when, in 1908, he moved with painter and partner 
Gabriele Miinter (1877-1962) to Murnau, just south of Munich in 
the Bavarian Alps. There he immersed himself in folk culture and 
was deeply affected by the powerful colors and the directness of 
the folk decorations and paintings on glass, a medium that he and 
Miinter adopted.

When in Munich, the couple lived in the Schwabing neighbor¬ 
hood of Munich, a bohemian enclave of cafes and liberalism. The 
area was a breeding ground for explorations of spirituality and the 
occult, especially Theosophy, which was a daily topic of conver¬ 
sation for many. Kandinsky owned the book Theosophie by 
German philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and attended his 
Theosophy lectures in Berlin in 1908. Inspired in part by Steiners 
ideas, Kandinsky in 1910 wrote Concerning the Spiritual in Art , 
published the next year and read worldwide. In it, he proclaimed 
the need to paint ones connectedness with the universe and to use 
an abstract vocabulary, one that functioned much like music, to 
portray the abstract qualities of spirituality. He wrote that “color 
directly influences the soul. Color is the keyboard, the eyes are 
the hammers, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is 
the hand that plays, touching one key or another purposively, to 
cause vibrations in the soul.” (See Primary Source , page 960.) 
Because of this parallel with music, Kandinsky titled his works 
“composition,” “improvisation,” and “concert.” Kandinsky, a 
well-read intellectual, was also influenced by the recent scientific 
discoveries of Einstein and Rutherford, which demonstrated that 


matter was not solid and stable but instead existed in a state of 
flux, convincing Kandinsky that a spiritual force coursed through 
all matter. 

While Kandinsky advocated abstract art by 1910, it was not 
until 1911 that his own work became entirely nonobjective. In 
1910, he began a series of ten paintings called “Compositions.” 
The first works were abstract but still readable, with objects 
reduced to simple childlike forms vaguely recognizable as figures, 
trees, horses, mountains, or churches, for example. (A rider on a 
horse, often blue, occasionally appears, the horse and rider motif 
being common in Kandinskys oeuvre and often interpreted as a 
reference to the artist himself and his idol St. George, the 
Christian dragonslayer, and their parallel quest to bring a new 
spirituality into the world. As is apparent, the motif became the 
group s name.) In these 1910 paintings, forms are often reduced to 
flat color and encased in a dark line, the deeply saturated color 
and line resembling the spiritual stained glass of churches. The 
total abstraction that appeared in 1911 can be seen in his 1913 
painting Sketch I for “ Composition VII ” (fig. 27.14). This was one 
of numerous preliminary studies for a large final version that

OURCE 



From Concerning the Spiritual in Art 

Kandinsky hoped to inaugurate a new spiritual era for modern human 
beings through his art. These remarks first appeared in 1911. 

I f you let your eye stray over a palette of colors, you experience two 
things. In the first place you receive a purely physical effect , namely 
the eye itself is enchanted by the beauty and other qualities of color. 
You experience satisfaction and delight, like a gourmet savoring a 
delicacy. Or the eye is stimulated as the tongue is titillated by a spicy 
dish. But then it grows calm and cool like a finger after touching 
ice. These are physical sensations, limited in duration. They are 


superficial, too, and leave no lasting impression behind if the soul 
remains closed. 

And so we come to the second result of looking at colors: their 
psychological effect. They produce a correspondent spiritual vibra¬ 
tion, and it is only as a step towards this spiritual vibration that the 
physical impression is of importance. ... 

Generally speaking, color directly influences the soul. Color is the 
keyboard, the eyes are the hammers, the soul is the piano with many 
strings. The artist is the hand that plays, touching one key or another 
purposively, to cause vibrations in the soul. 

It is evident therefore that color harmony must rest ultimately on 
purposive playing upon the human soul.

retains some of the same compositional elements but has a differ¬ 
ent palette. While Kandinsky’s hues still have the deep resonance 
of stained glass, the recognizable motifs of the earlier works are 
gone, yielding to an abstract play of color and painted line and 
form. The image may appear apocalyptic and chaotic, but these 
dynamic qualities are meant to capture the universal spiritual 
forces as the artist himself felt them. Despite the total abstraction, 
the image still feels like landscape—it has a horizontal spread we 
associate with the genre, and there is still a feeling of recession due 
to overlapping forms. But this “landscape” can be read as cosmic 
as much as earthly, and it is so abstract it can even be interpreted 
as microcosmic as well (portraying a microscopic view of nature). 


Which is precisely Kandinsky’s point since it is a picture of 
ubiquitous abstract mystical powers as the artist himself felt or 
experienced them. 

Franz Marc (1880-1916), who met Kandinsky in 1910 or 1911, 
shared many of the same objectives, especially the quest to 
portray spirituality. Both artists discussed how animals instinc¬ 
tively bonded with nature and thus with the cosmos. (This belief 
as well accounts for Kandinsky’s repeated use of the horse and 
rider motif, which dates to 1903.) Marc claimed that “animals 
with their virginal sense of life awakened all that was good in me. ” 
This statement conveys a feeling shared by all the artists of Der 
Blaue Reiter: the belief that Western, industrialized society was

THE MODERN WORLD 




spiritually bankrupt and therefore the need to return to nature. By 
1911, Marc was interweaving animals, often horses, into tightly 
composed landscapes, and by early 1912, he was using Cubism to 
effect this instinctual interlocking of animal, nature, and primor¬ 
dial forces, as seen in Animal Destinies (fig. 27.15) of 1913. 

In this work Marc has transformed Cubist facets into dynamic 
rays of light that seem to have passed through an unseen mystical 
crystal. The horses, foxes, and deer dissolve into these spiritual 
bolts of light, becoming one with them and a universal life force. 
A sense of a cataclysmic finale pervades the image, suggesting 
death, or the end of the life cycle, at which point living matter ful¬ 
fills its destiny by being absorbed back into the cosmos. On the 
reverse of the canvas, Marc wrote, “And all being is flaming 
suffering,” suggesting the inevitability of a spiritual redemption 
and the innate ability of animals to accept this course. Marc’s 
colors are the deep saturated hues of stained-glass windows, this 
reference to mystical illumination being reinforced by the illu- 
sionistic light streaming through the image. 

By 1911, Der Blaue Reiter had dissolved. The group had two 
shows. The first was in the Galerie Thannhauser in Munich in 
December 1911. It then toured Germany, often to harsh reviews, 
closing at Der Sturm Galerie in Berlin. Clearly, the German view¬ 
ing public was not ready to embrace the group’s striking and 
abstracted images of nature, despite the works’ evocation of tra¬ 
ditional art forms such as stained-glass windows and religious 
icons. The second exhibition featured works on paper and was 
mounted at a Munich bookstore. Perhaps more important than 
their exhibitions was the Der Blaue Reiter Almanac (The Blue 
Rider Yearbook ), which included members’ work along with 
reproductions of examples of Egyptian, Gothic, Asian, tribal, and 
folk art. Even works by children found a place in the Yearbook. 
Further enhancing the publication’s eclecticism was an article on 
the spirituality of music by the great tonalist composer and 
Theosophist Arnold Schonberg (1874-1951), who was also a 
painter and member of Der Blaue Rieter. The Yearbook was in 
effect a catalogue of art that was simple, direct, and spiritual—art 
that Kandinsky and Marc believed tapped into the cosmos and 
shared their own goals. 

PAUL KLEE One artist whose long career touched on many 
of the elements expressed in the The Blue Rider Yearbook is the 
Swiss painter Paul Klee (1879-1940). Officially, Klee was only 
minimally involved with Der Blaue Reiter. He had come to 
Munich in 1898 to study painting and had settled there in 1906. 
On friendly terms with Kandinsky and other members of Der 
Blaue Reiter, Klee’s understanding of Expressionism and other 
modern art movements came from his travels throughout Europe, 
although no voyage had a more decisive effect on him than a 
two-week trip to Tunisia. As had been the case with Delacroix 
and Monet the century before, the bright light and color of 
North Africa overwhelmed Klee. Soon after arriving, he wrote 
in his diary, “Color has taken hold of me....That is the meaning 
of this happy hour: Color and I are one. I’m a painter.” But 
equally important for his development was his connection to 



27.16 Paul Klee, The Niesen. 1915. Watercolor and pencil on paper,

Der Blaue Reiter, for his art was the most comprehensive amal¬ 
gam of all the sources listed in the Yearbook , especially children’s 
art, tribal art, and music. (Klee himself was an accomplished 
flutist.) 

Klee’s new Tunisia-inspired palette appears in The Niesen (fig. 
27.16) of 1915. Combined within the grid of Cubism is an abstract 
use of color reminiscent of Matisse and Kandinsky. The image 
echoes the directness and naivete of children’s and folk art, as well 
as the luminescent, saturated colors of stained-glass windows, the 
white of the paper flickering through the transparent watercolor 
to create a glowing illumination. We instantly sense the spiritual¬ 
ity that is the foundation of this picture and almost feel as though 
we can retrace Klee’s steps in its creation. The triangular moun¬ 
tain, the Niesen, dominates the image, its rock-hard geometry 
providing a sense of permanence and eternity while reflecting the 
Theosophical belief in the spirituality of the triangle, which rep¬ 
resents, among other things, the mystical correspondence of the 
universe. The night sky is filled with religious symbols, such as 
the Jewish Star of David and the Islamic crescent moon, which 
mingle with primitive hieroglyphic suns. The branches of the sole 
tree, suggesting life and all living things, rhythmically correspond 
to the rays emanating from the stars and suns above and are fur¬ 
ther linked to them by the Niesen, the shape of which powerfully 
connects earthly elements with cosmic ones. Through their color, 
the rectangular planes in front of the mountain evoke trees and 
plants, light, sun, fire, sky, and earth. 

Using an abstract vocabulary of color and shape, into which 
are inserted a handful of representational signs, Klee has stripped 
away everything inessential. He reveals in a poetic, understated 
way his innermost feelings about the nature of life and the universe. 
Or as he himself said, “Art does not render the visible; rather it 
makes visible.” Adding to the charm and intimacy of Klee’s art is 
its small scale and childlike “draftsmanship. ” 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 961 








Austrian Expressionism 

Another major center for Expressionism was Vienna. Home of 
Sigmund Freud, it was an especially repressive city, socially and 
culturally dominated by a conservative bourgeoisie and an 
aloof aristocracy resistant to change. In reaction, many avant- 
garde artists led bohemian lifestyles, shunning middle-class 
morals and standards. Not surprisingly, Viennese artists gener¬ 
ated some of the eras most neurotic and disturbing visual 
imagery, their art reflecting their psychic distance from conven¬ 
tional society. 

OSKAR KOKOSCHKA Perhaps the most prominent Viennese 
Expressionist is Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980), who entered the 
Vienna School of Arts and Crafts in 1905 and specialized in 
portraiture. In 1908, he exhibited with Gustav Klimt (see page 
921) and other avant-garde artists at the Vienna Kunstschau , an 
exhibition for modern art, where his violent portraits, inspired by 
Van Gogh, generated so much controversy he was expelled from 


art school. Kokoschka called his expressionistic portraits "black 
portraits,” and the sitters appeared to be so troubled that he 
became known as "the Freud of painting” who "paints the dirt of 
ones soul.” Kokoschka described his process similarly: "From 
their face, from the combination of expressions and movement, I 
tried to guess the true nature of a person, recreating with my own 
pictorial language, what would survive in the memory.” The 
following year, Kokoschka produced an exceptionally violent and 
sexual stage play, in the process capturing some of the deepest 
passions of the mind. The reaction to the play was so negative 
Kokoschka was forced to flee Vienna, going to Berlin for two 
years before returning. 

We can get a sense of how expressionistic his portraits looked 
from the figures in The Bride of the Wind (fig. 27.17), Kokoschka s 
1914 self-portrait with his lover Alma Mahler, the notoriously 
beautiful and sophisticated widow of the famous Austrian com¬ 
poser Gustav Mahler (1860-1911). By 1914, their passionate rela¬ 
tionship was threatened, and it ended the following year. The 
Bride of the Wind reflects the artist s distress. Originally,

962 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




Kokoschka intended to disguise this personal dilemma by calling 
the work Tristan and Isolde , after Wagner’s opera about two tragic 
lovers. The final title comes from Georg Trakl (1887-1914), a 
bohemian Viennese poet who produced morbid and nightmarish 
work. Kokoschka expresses his anxiety through coarse, violent 
brushstrokes and a seething, swirling composition. Oblivious to 
this turmoil, Mahler is shown peacefully sleeping, while 
Kokoschka restlessly worries, his body transformed into a flayed 
corpse, his hands grotesquely gnarled. The couple are contained 
in a monstrous shell-like cradle adrift in a landscape that is bleak, 
uncontrollable, and subject to cosmic forces, as suggested by the 
gravitational pull of a distant moon. This lunar force seems to rep¬ 
resent a Freudian sexual drive, for the moon is recessed in a vagi- 
nalike tube and framed by phallic peaks. The bizarre environment 
seems liquid and insubstantial, the entire image transformed into 
a threatening quagmire of paint and representing psychological 
urges and instability. 

EGON SCHIELE Egon Schiele (1890-1918), another major 
Viennese painter, likewise defied bourgeois mores. He watched 
his father’s painful death from syphilis, which probably accounts 
in part for his preoccupation with sickness and mortality. He then 
feuded bitterly with his conservative middle-class uncle in order 
to become an artist. He attended the Vienna Academy of Fine 
Art, and Gustav Klimt soon took him under his wing. At Klimt’s 
invitation, Schiele exhibited at the same 1908 and 1909 Vienna 
Kunstschau exhibitions as Kokoschka. He soon dropped out of art 
school and with friends established yet another secessionist 
organization, the Neukunstgruppe (New Art Group). Inspired 
by Klimts defiance toward bourgeois conservatism, he led a 
bohemian life, and in 1911 fled Vienna with his mistress to live in 
nearby small villages. 

Schiele’s art is dominated by images of nudes—of himself, 
prostitutes, and lovers—and although he worked in oil, many of 
his finest works are on paper, such as Self-Portrait (Man Twisting 
Arm Around Head) (fig. 27.18) of 1910. The nude had dominated 
Western art since antiquity, but Schieles presentation of the 
unclothed body departs from the tradition of the heroic male 
nude introduced in Classical antiquity and revived in the 
Renaissance. Here instead is an outright affront in its frank pres¬ 
entation of the body and its sickly and grotesque distortions. 
Schiele made the drawing most likely just after his uncle had cut 
him off financially, and it seems to represent the conflict between 
conformist bourgeois guardian and independent bohemian 
painter. Schiele is defiant, not only in his demonic glare and bold, 
contorted gestures but also in his willingness to present himself as 
disfigured and ghoulish. However, we also sense an element of 
self-scrutiny. The 20-year-old artist reveals ribs, underarm hair, 
and nipple. We sense the body’s skeleton, its physicality, and, 
despite the confrontational stare, its vulnerability. Schiele’s evoca¬ 
tive handling of the medium, the velvety quality of the charcoal 
and splashes of watercolor, reinforce the sensuality of the flesh 
exposed to deterioration, one of the work’s dominant themes. 
Just as his career was taking off in 1918, Schiele fell victim to the

pandemic influenza that killed 20 million people worldwide, 
including his pregnant wife who died three days before him. 

Cubism afier Picasso and Braque: Paris 

In France, Cubism was thoroughly entrenched by 1911-12, 
expanding well beyond Picasso and Braque. A handful of 
individual painters had closely followed Picasso’s and Braque’s 
developments in 1909-10, and in late 1910 they began exhibiting 
together at the large Paris Salons and at a private gallery, 
calling themselves the Section d’Or (Golden Section). Original 
members Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, and 
Henri Le Fauconnier were soon joined by Fernand Leger, Roger 
de La Fresnaye, Marcel Duchamp, and his brother Raymond 
Duchamp-Villon. In 1912, Gleizes and Metzinger published Du 
Cubisme (Cubism), the first book on the subject. 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 963 











ROBERT DELAUNAY Of this group, Robert Delaunay (1885- 
1941) was among the most influential. Unlike concurrent 
Analytic Cubist works by Braque and Picasso, Delaunays 1910 
Cubist paintings of the Eiffel Tower, an icon of modern technol¬ 
ogy, incorporated color, reflecting the artist s background as a 
Neo-Impressionist toward 1905. They also differed in their sub¬ 
ject: the movement and energy of modernity and the constant flux 
of the contemporary world. 

Delaunay s preoccupation with the dynamism of the modern 
world is evident in his 1914 Homage to Bleriot (fig. 27.19), honor¬ 
ing the French aviator Louis Bleriot (1872-1936), inventor of the 
single-wing airplane and the first person to fly across the English 
Channel. Delaunay integrates emblems of the modern world— 
airplanes, propellers, and the Eiffel Tower—into a Cubist compo¬ 
sition that is a kaleidoscope of floating balls and rotating disks 
suggesting whirling propellers and blazing suns. He creates move¬ 
ment not only through the shifting forms of Cubist space but also 
through the use of what Delaunay called “simultaneous con¬ 
trasts,” the placement of flat planes of primary and secondary 
colors next to one another, not only creating movement but also 
light and space, none of which is illusionistic. 

Two years before, Delaunay had exhibited total abstractions 
called Simultaneous Disks or Simultaneous Contrasts , paintings 
consisting entirely of the multihued concentric circles seen in 
Homage to Bleriot. While Delaunay s color theory was derived

from that of the nineteenth-century color theorist Michel-Eugene 
Chevreul (see page 874), his move into total abstraction was 
prompted by his contact with Marc and Kandinsky, who included 
him in the first Blaue Reiter exhibition. Some of these abstract 
paintings contain overlapping circles, suggesting a relationship 
among spheres in space, a reading reinforced by the subtitle Sun 
and Moon. The critic Guillaume Apollinaire, in his review of the 
1913 Salon des Independants, even drew a parallel between 
Delaunay s paintings of simultaneous disks and music when he 
labeled his abstract work “Orphism,” a reference to the mytho¬ 
logical lyre player Orpheus. But despite numerous parallels with 
Kandinsky, Delaunay s interests lay in depicting modernity and 
using an abstract vocabulary of simultaneous contrasts of color to 
create space, light, and movement, especially the fast tempo of a 
modern world of trains, planes, automobiles, electricity, tele¬ 
phones, and movies. 

Italian Futurism: The Visualization 
of Movement and Energy 

In January 1909, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944), a free- 
verse poet based in Milan, launched the Futurist movement when 
he published his Manifesto of Futurism , a pamphlet sent to 
thousands of artists and poets. On February 20, it appeared on the 
front page of the Parisian newspaper Le Figaro. Marinetti called 
for a rebirth of Italy, a country he saw as mired in the dusty, 
anachronistic Classical past. He advocated an uncompromising 
acceptance of modernity in all its manifestations, including 
electricity, automobiles, and machines, writing that “all subjects 
previously used must be swept aside in order to express our 
whirling life of steel, of pride, of fever and of speed.” (See 
,) 

For Marinetti, Futurism was a continual process, a permanent 
revolution. As soon as one change is effected, a new one must 
begin. Artists were no longer the manufacturers of a high-end 
product for a wealthy clientele, but rather they were vital forces 
operating within the community and influencing such daily con¬ 
cerns as fashion, games, toys, graphics, interior design, sports, 
food, and behavior. Marinetti toured Italy, enrolling artists, musi¬ 
cians, playwrights, architects, and designers into his movement. 
He arranged Futurist soirees , where from a stage he expounded 
upon his theories, often provoking, if not insulting, the audience 
in his attempt to incite them to action or even violence, which 
Marinetti perceived as socially cleansing and productive. 
Marinetti was intent on generating constant activism, which he saw 
as the conduit for the cultural risorgimento , or rebirth, of Italy. 

After a 1909 lecture in Milan presented to the avant-garde art 
group Famiglia Artistica (Artistic Family), Marinetti enlisted a 
handful of its members, including Umberto Boccioni (1882— 
1916), to become Futurists. In 1909, these artists were mostly 
Neo-Impressionists who transformed the color and energy of 
Divisionism to portray the dynamism of modernity. Their 
manifesto claimed that “Motion and light destroy the materiality 
of bodies” and that their concern would be the visualization of

movement and energy. For their visual vocabulary, they rejected 
anything redolent of Classical Italian culture and instead turned 
to science: the motion studies of Marey and Muybridge (see page 
940), Ernst Mach s graphic representations of shock waves, and 
Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen s x-rays, which, like Rutherford s dis¬ 
covery of the structure of the atom, proved the physical world 
was not stable but in constant flux. Much like Seurat, they wanted 
to create a new artistic language based on science, but without 
prescribing any one style. Their goal was to capture the intensity 
of movement—physical, psychological, and universal. In effect, 
they wanted to visualize Bergson s elan vital. 

Initially following Marinettis lead, the Futurists were 
activists. By the end of 1911, however, they had become disen¬ 
chanted with Marinetti s politics and instead chose to concentrate 
on art. More important, they turned from Neo-Impressionism to 
Cubism in their search for aesthetic direction. Their interest in 
Cubism, however, departed from the concerns of Braque and 
Picasso because the Futurists wanted to convey motion, dynamic 
energy, and social progress. After visiting Paris and seeing Cubist 


works in 1911, Boccioni painted States of Mind I: Farewells (fig. 
27.20). Embedded in a fractured world of Cubist facets is an erup¬ 
tion of steam, sound, moving objects, and psychic energy. The 
white curving lines over the locomotive reflect Mach s lines of 
thrust, whereas the repetition of the vaguely rendered green- 
tinted embracing couple is inspired by Muybridges motion 
sequences. Boccioni is championing not just modern technology, 
as represented by the train, electric railroad signals, and trussed 
steel towers, but the perpetual movement of all objects and 
energy. In a May 1911 lecture in Rome, he proclaimed that paint¬ 
ing had to capture the energy in all matter, energy in perpetual 
motion that dissolves the object while fusing it with surrounding 
space, an effect he called “plastic dynamism. ” 

In States of Mind I: Farewells , we sense not only the demateri- 
alization of the train and figures through time and movement, in 
part created by Boccioni s application of Divisionism, but also the 
simultaneous presence of space as something plastic and as vital as 
form. Swirling throughout the chaotic image is also an emotional 
energy—a sense of painful separation and disappearance—which

the title reveals as a theme of the work. This “plastic dynamism,” 
or the fusing of object and space, is evident in Boccioni s sculpture 
Unique Forms of Continuity in Space (fig. 27.21) of 1913. The 
pointed forms trailing off legs and torso capture the direction of 
the energy, as if the displaced space were itself worn like a mantle. 

Cubo-Futurism and Suprematism in Russia 

Of all the major European countries in the 1910s, Russia was the 
least industrialized. Nevertheless, it became an important center 
for avant-garde art. Most of the population were serfs ruled by an 
indifferent czar and dominated by the Orthodox Church. Despite 
a recent rush to modernize and become a world power, Russia in 
some respects remained trapped in the Middle Ages. In a culture 
dominated by folk-art and icon-painting traditions, how did radical 
art emerge? Part of the explanation may lie in the country’s 
desperate need for reform. When, in 1917, the October (or 


Bolshevik) Revolution was led by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870— 
1924), marking the first officially Communist-led revolution of 
the twentieth century, the change it brought about was far more 
radical than it had been in eighteenth-century America or France. 
The transformation in Russia was so revolutionary that it even 
embraced equality for women, who had proved integral to devel¬ 
oping the radical art of the preceding years. 

THE RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE In Moscow, Sergey Shchukin 
and Ivan Morozov, two of the greatest collectors of contemporary 
art, made available to Russian artists their extraordinary holdings 
of works by Matisse and Picasso, among other vanguard artists. In 
response to these works and to growing ties with the western 
European avant-garde, Russian artists began to explore Cubism 
and other approaches to abstraction. In 1910, a group of Russian 
artists formed an avant-garde art association called the Jack of 
Diamonds to support exhibitions of experimental work. Two 
years later, a splinter group, The Donkey’s Tail, emerged. The 
latter especially was modeled on the Futurists. These groups 
embraced the modern, emphasizing the machine and industry, 
both critical to bringing Russia into the twentieth century 

One of the outstanding painters in this avant-garde circle was 
Lyubov Popova (1889-1924), who studied in Paris in 1912 and in 
Italy in 1914, experiencing first hand the latest developments in 
Cubism and Futurism. These influences are reflected in The 
Traveler (fig. 27.22) of 1915. In this depiction of a woman wear¬ 
ing a yellow necklace and holding a green umbrella, Popova 
combines the fracturing of Cubism with the energy and move¬ 
ment of Futurism. 

KAZIMIR MALEVICH By 1913, many of the Russian artists 
were calling themselves Cubo-Futurists, a term coined by 
Kazimir Malevich (1878-1935) that reflects the dual origins of the 
style. Malevich had exhibited with both the Jack of Diamonds and 
The Donkeys Tail. In 1913, he designed Cubo-Futurist costumes 
and sets for what was hyped as the “First Futurist Opera” and 
titled Victory over the Sun. Presented in St. Petersburg, this radi¬ 
cal “opera” embraced the principle of zaum , a term invented by 
progressive Russian poets. Essentially, zaum was a language based 
on invented words and syntax, the meaning of which was suppos¬ 
edly implicit in the basic sounds and patterns of speech. The 
poets’ intention was to return to the nonrational and primitive 
base of language that, unencumbered by conventional meaning, 
expressed the essence of human experience. In Victory over the 
Sun , performers read from nonnarrative texts often consisting 
of invented words while being accompanied by the clatter of an 
out-of-tune piano. Malevich’s geometric costumes and sets were 
equally abstract. A stack of triangles ran up and down the legs of 
one costume, while one backdrop was a square divided in half to 
form two triangles, one white, the other black.

OURCE 


Kazimir Malevich (1878-1935) 



From The Non-Objective World 

Kazimir Malevich first published The Non-Objective World in 1919 in 
the catalogue for the 10th State Exhibition in Moscow. Here, he empha¬ 
sizes how nonobjective art represents feeling , not objects, as it strips 
away all of the accumulations ofcivilization to get at the essence of exis¬ 
tence, much as so-called primitive artists do. 

U nder Suprematism I understand the supremacy of pure feeling 
in creating art. ... 

Hence, to the Suprematist, the appropriate means of representation 
is always the one which gives fullest possible expression to feeling as 
such and which ignores the familiar appearance of objects. ... 

Even I was gripped by a kind of timidity bordering on fear when it 
came to leaving “the world of will and idea,” in which I had lived and 
worked and in the reality of which I had believed. 


But a blissful sense of liberating non-objectivity drew me forth into 
the “desert,” where nothing is real except feeling ... and so feeling 
became the substance of my life. 

This was no “empty square” [referring to the Black Square ] which 
I had exhibited but rather the feeling of non-objectivity. ... 

The black square on the white field was the first form in which 
non-objective feeling came to be expressed. The square = feeling, the 
white field = the void beyond this feeling. ... 

The Suprematist square and the forms proceeding out of it can be 
likened to the primitive marks (symbols) of aboriginal man which 
represented, in their combinations, not ornament hut a feeling of 
rhythm. 

Suprematism did not bring into being a new world of feeling, but, 
rather, an altogether new and direct form of representation of the 
world of feeling.

paintings in 0,10 (Zero-Ten): The Last Futurist Exhibition. St. Petersburg, 
December 1915 


It took Malevich two years to realize the implications of zaum 
for his art. In 1915, after working in a Cubo-Futurist style similar 
to Popova s, Malevich presented 39 nonobjective geometric paint¬ 
ings in a St. Petersburg exhibition entitled 0, 10 (Zero-Ten): The 
Last Futurist Exhibition (fig. 27,23). The best-known work in the 
show is Black Square , seen in the installation photograph hanging 
in the manner of a Russian icon across the corner of a room. 
Malevich labeled his new work “Suprematism.” In his 1919 
Suprematist treatise The Non-Objective World , Malevich 
explained that Suprematism refers to the supremacy of feeling. 
(See Primary Source , above.) This feeling is not just personal or 
emotional but revelatory, for the abstract essence of the world is

translated into painting using an entirely new abstract language, 
stripped of any vestiges of realism. Like his fellow Russian 
Kandinsky, Malevich was a mystic, searching for cosmic unity, 
even a utopian world, as did supporters of the Bolshevik 
Revolution of 1917. Black Square embodies both the legacy of 
simple, otherworldly Russian icons and the mysticism of folk art. 
Its simple black form is as iconic as a frontal Madonna or saint, 
with the white ground extending off the four sides and projecting 
a sense of infinity. 

Malevichs abstract language included different geometric 
shapes and colors. In Suprematist Composition: Airplane Flying (fig. 
27.24), also painted in 1915, he used red, yellow, and blue shapes 
in addition to black to create a sensation of movement and floating. 
Color, size, and shape produce a unique rhythm against the white 
ground. From one composition to the next, Malevich altered the 
rhythm by changing these formal characteristics. Although the 
title includes the word “airplane” and suggests an infatuation with 
technology, the image itself relates to the experience of air travel 
and the new relationship to the universe brought about by this 
mode of transportation. 

Unfortunately, reproductions of Malevich’s paintings almost 
never show their organic quality. The shapes in Airplane Flying 
may appear to be hard-edged, geometric, and machine-made, but 
in person one can see that their boundaries waver ever so slightly 
and there is a sense of a human hand applying paint to canvas. 
Malevich’s paintings contain the same human presence, even if not 
as overtly stated, that is evident in the work of Kandinsky. And 
like Kandinsky, Malevich, through his white ground which 
evokes infinity, suggests a connection with the universe. 

Cubism and Fantasy: 

Marc Chagall and Giorgio de Chirico 

Malevich reduced Cubist geometry to the point that Cubist 
structure itself disappeared. Fellow Russian Marc Chagall 
(1887-1985), however, embraced Cubist composition in many of 
his works and remained a representational artist. With its ability 
to juxtapose and integrate the most disparate objects, Cubism 
was a perfect tool for creating dreamlike fantasy worlds. Chagall 
grew up in the Jewish quarter of Vitebsk, and his paintings evoke 
his memories of the simpler times, values, and rituals that he had 
experienced in the shtetl. In 1910, Chagall moved to Paris, where 
he immediately converted to Cubism, as seen in I and the Village 
(fig. 27.25) of the following year. But this dream image is hardly 
a Cubist intellectual dissection of form. Using the saturated col¬ 
ors of a stained-glass window and the simple shapes of Russian 
folk art, Chagall conjures up the most elemental issues of life 
itself. Man and animal are equated in almost mirrorlike symmetry, 
and the translucent, ephemeral quality of their heads makes the 
scene appear ethereal and mystical. The circular composition 
suggests the cycle of life, with birth as the blooming bush and 
death as the farmer carrying a scythe. Or it could be interpreted 
as the four seasons. Chagall did not explain his works and 
adamantly denied they had any links to storytelling or fairy tale.

Instead his dreamscapes are a Cubist kaleidoscope of objects and 
incidents evoking the most elemental issues of life and often 
embedded in a wondrous fairy-tale scene that has powerful psy¬ 
chological repercussions. 

Arriving in Paris at virtually the same moment as Chagall was 
the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978). While studying 
in Munich from 1905 to 1909, de Chirico was heavily influenced 
by German Symbolist artists, the Theosophy of Schopenhauer, 
and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who described life as 
a “foreboding that underneath this reality in which we live and 
have our being, another and altogether different reality lies con¬ 
cealed.” He moved to Italy in 1909, settling in Florence in 1910, 
where, influenced by the strong southern light of Italy and the 
arcades of the Piazza Santa Croce, he made the first of his 
“Metaphysical Town Squares,” images of an empty piazza formed 
by austere buildings rendered as bold simple forms and carefully 
delineated by strong line. His compositions and use of space 
became increasingly complex after his arrival in Paris in 1911, as 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 969 










seen in his 1914 Mystery and Melancholy of a Street (fig. 27.26), 
made after his permanent return to Italy in 1914. His reliance on 
strong diagonal lines, such as the receding buildings and shadows, 
and his use of unstable disjointed space make his works vaguely 
echo Cubism. 

And yet de Chirico s pictures are stylistically conventional, 
even suggesting stage sets. Unlike his Futurist compatriots, de 
Chirico idolized rather than rejected the Classical past, although 
he subverted its austere authority by evoking a Romantic melan¬ 
choly, using ominous shadows, intense light, and skewed perspec¬ 
tive to create an unsettling eeriness. In Mystery and Melancholy of 
a Street , railroad tracks, darkened windows and arches, the empty 
van, and the girl with the hoop seem to be symbols, but de 
Chirico provides no clues about their meaning, insisting none 
existed. Instead, the painting offers a dreamscape, one with a 
poetic mood and wide open to interpretation. De Chirico called 
his work “Metaphysical Painting,” revealing the reality underly¬ 
ing the appearance of things. As we shall see in the next chapter, 
his psychologically provocative poetic reveries would serve as a 
springboard for representational Surrealism in the coming decade. 


MARCEL DUCHAMP AND THE 
ADVENT OF AN ART OF IDEAS 

Along with Picasso and Matisse, Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) 
played a major role in defining the art of the first half of the 
century, his influence then surging in the second half to the point 
that he almost singlehandedly molded post-1950 art. His great 
contribution was declaring that art was as much about ideas, thus 
residing in the mind, as it was about the beauty of what can be 
seen, thus of the retina. Realizing that Picasso and Braque, among 
others, were calling into question the meaning of art as they made 
the very nature of art visible, Duchamp took their development 
one step further by looking at the cerebral rather than formalist 
components of art and calling into question its very status as art 
by asking: What is art, and how does art function? 

Working in Paris in the 1910s, Duchamp quickly digested 
Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Toward 1911, he took on 
Cubism, as seen in Nude Descending a Staircase , No. 2 (fig. 27.27), 
which he attempted to exhibit at the 1912 Salon des Independants.

The hanging jury, which included some of his friends and even his 
two brothers, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon, 
found the painting neither serious nor Cubist enough, so 
Duchamp withdrew it. The work began as an illustration for a 
poem that described a figure ascending a stairway to the stars. 
Ever the iconoclast, Duchamp portrayed a nude figure, mechani¬ 
cal-looking and grandly descending a staircase, as he described it, 
“More majestic you know, the way its done in music halls.” 
Duchamp was fascinated by Marey s chronophotographs, which 
inspired the sequential movement of his “nude.” Because one 
needs to know the title to understand that the figure is unclothed, 


Duchamp underscores the way in which words become an 
integral part of an artwork, going so far as to paint the title on 
the front of the work. With this gesture, Duchamp makes an 
important move in his exploration of the essence of art. A title, 
which defines a work, circumscribes its meaning, and also serves 
as a tool for remembering the work, fulfilling a role as important 
as the artwork itself. Here, then, Duchamp makes plain the 
inseparability not only of artwork and title, but of visual and 
linguistic experience. 

Duchamps machinelike figure was not unique for 1912. By 
then, the theme was becoming commonplace in Cubist art, 
reflecting the era s worship of technology as a symbol of moder¬ 
nity and sciences ability to improve the world. For example, 
Duchamps older brother, Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876— 
1918), was a Cubist sculptor who on occasion rendered living 
forms as machines, as in Horse (fig. 27.28). Initial drawings show 
a realistic horse, but the final sculpture is an abstract monument 
to horsepower: The body has become a tapering cylinder with 
the tension of a coiled spring, and the legs look like thrusting 
pistons. Cubist facets and geometry have been ordered into an 
animal of twisting dynamism. Duchamp-Villon s horse, like most 
other mechanomorphic figures from the period, underscores the 
import role of industry in fashioning the modern age. In contrast, 
Marcel Duchamps mechanical nude is humorous, sarcastic, 
and sacrilegious.

The following year Marcel Duchamp s humorous inquiry into 
the nature of art culminated in a revolution as monumental as 
Picasso s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. Duchamp placed a bicycle 
wheel upside down on a stool (fig. 27.29) and declared it art. He 


later labeled his sculpture an “Assisted Readymade,” because he 
had combined two found objects—a witty challenge to the notion 
that art involved only technical skill and craft. As important, he 
demonstrated that context determines the meaning of art, since by 
uniting these disparate objects, taking each out of its normal con¬ 
text and putting it in a new one, he gave each component of his 
sculpture a new meaning. Actually, Bicycle Wheel is so enigmatic 
it provokes wild interpretations, demonstrating that the meaning 
of a work of art also comes from viewers who bring their experi¬ 
ences to bear on the work. To an art historian, for example, the 
stool may suggest a pedestal and the wheel a head, an interpreta¬ 
tion that can be seen as a clever engagement with artistic tradition, 
evoking the countless sculpted portrait busts that line museum 
galleries. A cyclist or a barfly most likely would come up with an 
entirely different scenario for the piece. 

Duchamp was adamant that his Assisted Readymades had no 
aesthetic value. The act of combining stool and wheel, placing 
each in a new context, was more important to him than the result¬ 
ing object. Duchamp made two other Assisted Readymades prior 
to World War I; none was exhibited. Only during the war years 
was his revolution fully unleashed on the art world, as we shall see 
in the next chapter (see page 986). But it is important to introduce 
Duchamp as prewar artist, for although he became a major figure 
in the Dada movement, which arose in large part as a reaction to 
World War I, it must be understood that his revolutionary art was 
not initially made as a political and social statement but rather as 
an artistic one that came on the heals of the investigations of 
Picasso and Braque. 

CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI AND THE 
BIRTH OF MODERNIST SCULPTURE 

Like Picassos constructions and Duchamps “Assisted 
Readymades,” the sculptures of Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) 
were among the most innovative artworks being produced before 
the war. Indeed, Brancusis work is so minimal-looking and 
abstract it has come to symbolize modern sculpture itself. 
Ironically, Brancusis background could not have been more 
removed from the modern world. The son of Romanian peasants, 
he grew up herding sheep in the remote village of Tirju-Jiu in the 
Carpathian mountains. The region had a long tradition of ornate 
folk carving, in which Brancusi excelled. After studying art in 
Bucharest and passing through Munich in 1903, he settled in Paris 
and became an assistant to Auguste Rodin. Declaring that 
“Nothing can grow under big trees,” he struck out on his own. 

Escaping the far-reaching shadow of Rodin, an artist with 
strong ties to nineteenth-century art, Brancusi steered a radical 
course that, aesthetically if not thematically broke, with sculp¬ 
tural tradition and laid a foundation for much twentieth-century 
sculpture. Brancusi s mature style began to evolve as early as 1907, 
and by 1910 it had reached a minimal essence, as seen in The 
Newborn (fig. 27.30) of 1915. Here, he reduces his subject to an 
ovoid resembling an egg, which suggests fertility and birth. The

form also resembles a head, with the concave depression as the 
mouth releasing its first cry and the slender triangular piercing as 
the nose. Yet the whole is so abstract that we are left with a sense 
of the simple form of the marble, which seems to harbor the hid¬ 
den mysteries of life. The work has the elemental power of the 
Cycladic sculpture (see pages 82-84) and simplified, geometric 
African masks that Brancusi, like Picasso and Matisse, knew so 
well. Brancusi understood that by using a minimalist vocabulary, 
he was able to shed in works like The Newborn the clutter of 
visual reality to pursue invisible essential truths that revealed the 
very core of existence. As Brancusi explained, “Simplicity is not 
an end in art, but one arrives at simplicity in spite of oneself in 
approaching the real sense of things. ” His works evoke an essence 
of perfection, as though the scale, the smooth unblemished sur¬ 
faced, and the composition are so precise that they cannot be 
altered one iota without destroying their purity and the sense that 
they capture a primordial reality underlying all life. 

Brancusis sculpture focuses on only a handful of themes, 
which he repeated numerous times, often in different mediums, 
including bronze, wood, stainless steel, and stone of different 
kinds. The shift in medium allowed Brancusi to explore both the 
visual and psychological associations of his material. His meticu¬ 
lous control over his work included designing the bases and 
pedestals, as can be seen in Bird in Space (fig. 27.31), where the

York. Given anonymously 



CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 


973 








sculpture includes the cylindrical stone base and the hourglass¬ 
shaped wood pedestal. This stacked system of presentation has 
the effect of distancing the sculpture from the space of the room 
and placing it within its own perfect world. Brancusi also realized 
the height of the presentation of his sculpture affected a viewer s 
physical and psychological relationship to it, and thus reading of 
it. Brancusi insisted, for example, that The Newborn be exhibited 
on a low pedestal, forcing a viewer to lean over the piece, placing 
his viewers in the position of an adult looking down at an infant 
in a cradle. In contrast, Bird in Space would be presented very 
high, like a soaring bird. 

Brancusi introduced the bird motif as early as 1910. Maiastra 
was based on Romanian legends about a magical golden bird 
whose song held miraculous powers. By the 1920s, Brancusi 
showed the same bird soaring, as in Bird in Space , instead of 
perched. The elegantly streamlined form balances on a short, 
tapering column, the pinched section suggesting the juncture of 
legs and body. But of course we do not really see a bird. Instead 
Brancusi has presented us with the spirit of flight, as suggested by 
the smooth streamlined form that seems to gracefully and effort¬ 
lessly cut through the air. Using an entirely different vocabulary, 
Brancusi, like Malevich, sought to reveal “the real sense of things. ” 


AMERICAN ART 

Modernism did not come to America until the second decade of 
the twentieth century. It first appeared in New York at “291,” the 
nickname for the Little Galleries of the Photo Secession, the 
progressive art gallery owned by Alfred Stieglitz (see page 936). 
Beginning in 1909, Stieglitz started featuring such seminal 
Modernists as Picasso, Matisse, Henri Rousseau, Rodin, and 
Brancusi as well as African art and children s art. The key break¬ 
through Modernist event in New York was the 1913 International 
Exhibition of Modern Art , known as the Armory Show after the 
26th Street armory where it was held. Exhibited were over 400 
European works, mostly French, from Delacroix, through 
Courbet, Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Cezanne, to Picasso, 
Brancusi, and Matisse. Three times as many American artists were 
represented, but by comparison their work often looked provin¬ 
cial and was largely ignored. 

Ruthless newspaper reviews lambasted the radical contempo¬ 
rary French art, and the public came out in droves—75,000 
people attended the four-week show. They came especially to 
ridicule Duchamp s Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2, which one 
reviewer claimed looked like an “explosion in a shingle factory. ”

The exhibitions slogan was “The New Spirit,” and its symbol 
was the pine-tree flag of Revolutionary Massachusetts. The 
American organizers intentionally set out to create their own 
revolution, to jolt conventional bourgeois taste and bring about 
an awareness and appreciation of contemporary art. Despite the 
public s derision, the show spawned several modern art galleries 
and collectors adventurous enough to dedicate themselves to 
supporting radical art. 

America's First Modernists: 

Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley 

American artists digested European Modernism almost as quickly 
as it was made, but those resident in Europe, especially in Paris, 
absorbed most rapidly the new movements of Fauvism and 
Cubism. In 1908, a young Arthur Dove (1880-1946) was in Paris, 
where he saw work by Matisse and the Fauves. When he returned 
to New York, he met Stieglitz and began showing at “291.” 

While remaining involved in the New York City art world 
throughout his life, Dove lived in rural areas in New York State 
and Connecticut, even spending several years on a houseboat 
anchored off Long Island. His art focused on nature, not moder¬ 
nity, and capturing universal forces. By 1910, he was painting com¬ 
plete abstractions, two years before Kandinsky and Delaunay, and 
this abstraction can be seen in a work from 1912, Plant Forms (fig. 
27.32), from a series of pastels titled The Ten Commandments , a 
title invoking spirituality. 

In this work, Dove has supplied aspects of nature without 
painting them illusionistically. As with Cubism, the composition 
is made up of abstract components, although they overlap in a 
logical, consistent fashion to suggest continuous recession in 
space. The work has light and atmosphere as well as an organic 
quality, largely due to the elliptical, oval, and round forms and the 
biomorphic shapes suggesting plants and trees. We associate the 
colors green, ocher, and brown with earth and vegetation, and 
white and yellow with light. The curved white and yellow forms 
evoke suns, moons, and hills, and although the frondlike shapes 
recall plants and trees, they also seem like symbols of an uniden¬ 
tifiable burst of energy. We feel the powerful surge of nature and 
an elemental life force, and because each form suggests many 
different objects, Dove is able to convey the universal intercon¬ 
nectedness of all things. The picture is cosmic in its scope, yet 
provides an intimate view of nature. Dove s preoccupation with 
portraying potent natural forces will become a major theme in 
American art and, as we shall see, one of the major issues for 
artists in Stieglitz s circle. 

Stieglitzs stable of artists also included Marsden Hartley 
(1877-1943), a Maine native who was making Pointillist paintings 
of the New England woods when the two met in 1909. In 1912, 
Hartley set off for Paris, where he became infatuated with the 
tribal art on view at the Trocadero Museum, declaring, with an air 
of Western supremacy, that one “can no longer remain the same in 
the presence of these mighty children who get so close to the uni¬ 
versal idea in their mud-baking.” He stated that art had to be

“created out of spiritual necessity” and, finding French art super¬ 
ficial and lacking soul, he went to Berlin in 1913. There he read 
the writings of the great German mystics, such as Jakob Boehme 
(1575-1624). He then developed a unique form of Synthetic 
Cubism, which he combined with Fauvist and German 
Expressionist color to produce paintings filled with spiritual con¬ 
tent, as can be seen in Portrait of a German Officer (fig. 27.33), 
completed in 1914 and later bought by Stieglitz. 


CHAPTER 27 TOWARD ABSTRACTION: THE MODERNIST REVOLUTION, 1 904-1 91 4 975 








This large painting is one in a series dedicated to the memory 
of Karl von Freyburg, Hartley’s lover, who was among the first 
soldiers killed in World War I. Shown in the painting are such 
German military paraphernalia as iron crosses, insignia, helmets, 
boots, service stripes, badges, flags, spurs, and tassels. In a sense, 
this abstraction is a still life that in spirit recalls Victorian keep¬ 
sake boxes made for the deceased and containing photographs, 
clothing, hair, and memorabilia—all pressed under glass. The 
painting is dominated by a triangle and is filled with circles that 
reflect Kandinskys Theosophical belief in the symbolism of 
geometry. In its jumble of color, form, and composition, Portrait 
of a German Officer expresses a cosmic force similar to 
Kandinsky’s “Compositions” (see fig. 27.14) from the same 
period, and at times its abstraction seems to suggest landscape 
almost as readily as it does still life. With the outbreak of World 
War I, Hartley returned to the United States and to making land¬ 
scapes, using an Expressionist style that revealed the elemental, 
spiritual power of nature. 

EARLY MODERN ARCHITECTURE 
IN EUROPE 

In Chapter 26, we saw the emergence of two distinct approaches 
to modern architecture, one in the United States and another 
in Europe. American artists such as Louis Sullivan and Frank 
Lloyd Wright challenged historicism and conventional revivalism 
when they eliminated the distinction between the form of a 


building and its proposed function. In Europe, we also saw a 
rejection of revival styles when Art Nouveau defined modern 
architecture as an organic style of growth and movement. 
Throughout the twentieth century, modern architecture followed 
these opposite poles set by the Chicago School and Art 
Nouveau—the rational, geometric and functional versus the 
personal, referential, and expressive. 

Austrian and German Modernist Architecture 

Austria and Germany shaped modern architecture in the opening 
decades of the century. Charles Rennie Mackintosh, discussed 
in the previous chapter (see page 930), became the rage in Europe 
in the 1890s and was particularly idolized in Vienna at the turn of 
the century by young architects searching for an alternative to 
Art Nouveau. 

ADOLF LOOS An especially influential Viennese architect was 
Adolf Loos (1870-1933). After graduating from the Dresden 
College of Technology, Loos traveled to Chicago to attend the 
1893 Columbian Exposition and stayed three years, digesting the 
functionalism of the Midwest architects and especially coming 
under the spell of Louis Sullivan. Upon returning to Vienna, he 
designed interiors and wrote for a liberal magazine, in which he 
railed against the extravagant ornamentation of Art Nouveau. In 
1908, he published his functionalist theories in a book titled 
Ornament and Grime. He declared that except for tombs and 
monuments, buildings should be functional. “Modern man, the

man with modern nerves, does not need ornamentation; it disgusts 
him,” he wrote. He even drew a parallel between ornament and 
scatological graffiti. Furthermore, as a socialist, he found decora¬ 
tion and historicism particularly offensive because of their associa¬ 
tions with the wealthy as well as with the oppression of the artisan. 

Loos put his theories into practice in the Steiner House (fig. 
27.34) of 1910. In the U-shaped garden facade seen here, Loos 
used a severe design that emphasizes geometric blocklike compo¬ 
nents of the structure. Loos s unadorned building even results in 
the cornice almost disappearing, being reduced to a thin, almost 
undetectable strip. The windows, especially the horizontal ones, 
seem more functional than aesthetic. In 1923, Loos migrated to 
Paris, where, as we shall see, High Modernist architects embraced 
his antiornamentalism, and viewed his Steiner House as an impor¬ 
tant model. 

HERMANN MUTHESIUS AND PETER BEHRENS In 

Germany, government and industry nurtured Modernist architec¬ 
ture. In 1896, government officials sent architect Hermann 
Muthesius to London, then the world leader in quality mass pro¬ 
duction, to study British industry and design. Upon returning 
home in 1904, Muthesius was appointed to the Prussian Trade 


Commission and given the task of restructuring education in the 
applied arts. To dominate world markets, he advocated mass 
production of functional objects executed in a well-designed 
machine style. In 1907, he was instrumental in establishing the 
Deutsche Werkbund, an association of architects, designers, writ¬ 
ers, and industrialists whose goal was “selecting the best represen¬ 
tatives of art, industry, crafts, and trades, and combining all efforts 
toward high quality in industrial work. ” In architecture he called 
for a new monumental style based on Schinkel s Classicism (see 
page 854), but reflecting modern industrial values, meaning mass 
production and modular components. 

One of Muthesius s appointments to the Werkbund was archi¬ 
tect Peter Behrens (1868-1940), who had been head of an applied- 
arts school in Dtisseldorf. Also in 1907, Behrens was named 
design consultant to A.E.G., the German General Electric 
Company; he was responsible for the design of their buildings, 
products, and marketing materials. Between the Werkbund and 
A.E.G., Behrens had a mandate to implement the German belief 
in industrialization as its Manifest Destiny and he was charged 
with finding a visual expression for the brute reality of industrial 
power. He accomplished this goal in his finest A.E.G. building, 
the 1909 Berlin Turbinenfabrik (Turbine Factory) (fig. 27.35).

27.36 Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer. Fagus Factory, Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany 


This temple to industry is a veritable symbol of industrial 
might. The enormous main space is constructed of a row of 
hinged steel arches (their shape echoed in the roofline on the 
facade) like those used for nineteenth-century ferrovitreous 
train stations and exhibition halls (see figs. 25.38 and 25.39). 
Instead of a greenhouse encased in a historical facade, however, 
Behrens produces an abstract monumental structure that evokes 
a noble Classical temple and Egyptian entrance gateway. The 
corners are massive rusticated Egyptian pylons that support an 
enormous gable, whereas the windows on the side walls are 
recessed so that the lower portion of the steel arches is exposed, 
making the row of arches resemble a colonnade. Yet Behrens 
declares the building’s modernity not only in its austere abstract 
vocabulary but also in the enormous window on the end—an 
unmistakably Modernist transparent curtain wall that seems to 
hang from the “pediment. ” 

Although Behrens aggrandized industry in the monumental 
Turbinenfabrik, he did not produce the machine style that 
Muthesius was advocating—the Typisierung , a type or a basic unit, 
the equivalent of a mass-produced modular building that could be 


used by all architects. This machine style would be developed by 
the three architects in Behrenss office: Walter Gropius, Ludwig 
Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier. 

WALTER GROPIUS Of the architects in Behrens’s office in 
1910, Walter Gropius (1883-1969) was the most advanced. With 
associate Adolf Meyer, he was commissioned in 1911 to design 
the Fagus Factory (fig. 27.36), a shoe plant in Alfeld-an-der- 
Leine. Well versed in the achievements of Loos and Behrens, 
Gropius nonetheless reached back to the Chicago School and 
utilized their steel-grid skeleton, sheathed in a ferrovitreous 
curtain wall. The factory’s glass facade appears to be magically 
suspended from the brick-faced entablature above. It even turns 
corners unobstructed. The building feels light and transparent, 
the window mullions thin and elegant. Fiorizontal opaque panels, 
the exact size and shape of the glass, indicate each of the three 
floors and continue the modular composition of the windows. 
The only nod to the past is the prominent Beaux-Arts entrance 
and the thin pseudo-piers faced in brick that support the entabla¬ 
ture. Otherwise, with the Fagus Factory, Gropius created the 


978 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






























machine style Muthesius was seeking: an unadorned building that 
adheres to a grid skeleton. This building type was so efficient and 
reproducible it would serve as the prototype for the glass-box 
structures that would dominate world architecture for the rest of 
the century. 

German Expressionist Architecture 

Not all German architects embraced technology, the Machine 
Age, and Muthesius s concept of the Typisierung. Some instead 
designed expressive spiritual structures meant to counter the cold 
impersonal impact of modernity. 

HENRI VAN DE VELDE Another Werkbund architect was Henri 
van de Velde (1863-1957), a native of Belgium, where he was ini¬ 
tially a successful Neo-Impressionist painter and then an Art 
Nouveau architect and designer. In 1901, he became consultant to 
the craft industries in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimer. Van de 
Velde was a strong advocate of Nietzsches theory of the Uber- 
mensch and believed in the importance of designing powerful, 
expressive architecture. He was also heavily influenced by the 
Munich psychologist Theodor Lipps and his theory of Einjuhlung , 
meaning “empathy,” the mystical projection of the ego onto the 
art object. This background led him to examine Wilhelm 
Worringer’s 1908 book Abstaktion und Einjuhlung (Abstraction 
and Empathy ), which advocated attaining transcendence through 
abstraction as well as championing an aesthetic of emphatic 
expression of vital psychic states. 


On a 1903 trip to Greece and the Middle East, Van de Velde 
became entranced by the powerful simplicity and purity of 
Assyrian and Mycenaean buildings (see pages 34-37 and 93-99), 
which he translated into modern terms in the theater he built for 
the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne (fig. 27.37). This struc¬ 
ture was deliberately designed to counter Mathesius’s Typisierung , 
as best represented by Gropiuss model factory at the 1914 fair. 
Despite its massive abstraction, Van de Velde s structure seems 
like a living organic body rather than a cold, rigid box. Each space 
within the building is readable from the exterior and has its own 
identity. Because of the curves, the building seems to swell and 
breathe. However, this is no longer the springtime effervescence 
of Art Nouveau; rather, it is a reflection of a need to invest archi¬ 
tecture with a spirituality and life force and to enhance these qual¬ 
ities by echoing the powerful monumentality and purity of the 
forms of ancient Near Eastern civilizations. 

BRUNO TAUT A more overt spiritual contribution at the 1914 
Werkbund Exhibition was Bruno Tauts (1880-1928) Glass 
Pavilion (fig. 27.38), built for the glass industry and reflecting his 
belief in the mystical properties of crystal. The guru of glass was 
poet Paul Scheerbart, whose 1914 essay “Glasarchitektur,” pub¬ 
lished in Der Sturm , had a tremendous impact on artists and archi¬ 
tects. (See www.myartslab.com. ) The entablature of Taut’s Glass 
Pavilion is even etched with Scheerbart’s aphorisms about the 
power of glass. 

Scheerbart claimed that only a glass architecture that opened 
all rooms to light could raise German culture to a new spiritual

level. Consequently, Taut used glass brick for the walls and floors. 
The bulbous dome, which resembles a giant crystal, is made of 
two layers of glass; the outer one reflective, the inner one a myr¬ 
iad of colored-glass pieces resembling medieval stained glass. Taut 
also considered his cupola to be Gothic, its facets evoking the elan 
vital of the ribbing of the Flamboyant style. The ceiling of the 


main space had a central oculus that emitted a shower of colored 
spiritual light. 

MAX BERG The year before, the mystically inspired architect 
Max Berg (1870-1947) used a similar ocular motif for his 
Jahrhunderthalle (Centennial Hall) (fig. 27.39) in Breslau, erected 
to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Germany’s liberation from 
Napoleon s rule. Berg s Expressionism is quite Romantic, for the 
enormous building, made possible by ferroconcrete (steel-rein¬ 
forced concrete), conjures the sublime grandeur of Piranesi s fan¬ 
tasies of Rome (see fig. 23.3) and Boullee s visionary monuments 
(see fig. 23.24). (See Materials and Techniques , page 1013.) Massive 
elliptical arches resemble an ancient Roman aqueduct or bridge 
bent into a circle and springing from the floor. The ribbing of the 
ceiling recalls the Pantheon, but solid and void have been reversed 
since the coffered section is now windows, creating an aura of 
celestial light that makes the dome seem to float. The Pantheon s 
ocular opening is now closed. At the time, critics likened this dark 
disk to the iris of an eye, and the entire levitating dome to a giant 
eyeball connected to the universe. As expressed by one contem¬ 
porary writer, “the cosmos opened to reveal the courses of the 
stars and the empyrean. ” 

In 1925, Berg abandoned architecture to dedicate his life to 
Christian mysticism. But in 1912, when Die Briicke and Der 
Blaue Reiter were committed to leading Germany into a world of 
higher spirituality through painting, prints, and drawings, Berg 
sought to achieve the same in ferroconcrete and glass.

P HYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, WORLD WAR I DEVASTATED 

Western civilization. The destruction and loss of life were staggering, with 
hundreds of thousands of soldiers dying in single battles. The logic, science, 
and technology that many thought would bring a better world had gone 
horribly awry. Instead of a better world, the advancements of the nineteenth century 


had produced such hi-tech weapons as machine guns, long-range 
artillery, tanks, submarines, fighter planes, and mustard gas. 

To many, the very concept of nationalism now seemed 
destructive, and the rise of the first Communist government in 
Russia in 1917 offered some the hope of salvation. Around the 
world, branches of the Communist Party sprang up, with the goal 
of creating a nationless world united by the proletariat, the work¬ 
ing class that provides the labor force for the capitalist system. 
Others maintained that a new world order could not be attained 
without first destroying the old; they advocated anarchy, which 
remained a constant threat in the postwar decades. Despite this 
drive to create a nationless and classless world, by the 1930s, it 
was fascism that had taken hold of European politics. Fascism, 
a totalitarian political system that exalts the nation over the indi¬ 
vidual and demands allegiance to a single leader, held a special 
appeal in nations defeated in World War I. Germany, in particular, 
had been humiliated by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and 
had suffered extreme inflation and then economic collapse. 
Germans gradually came under the spell of Adolf Hitler 
(1889-1945) and the Nazis, who skillfully used economic crises 
and anti-Semitism to consolidate their power. In Italy, Spain, 
and Japan, as well, fascists, under the command of charismatic 
leaders, took control. Armed with new technological tools of 

Detail of figure 28.38, Joseph Stella, The Voice of the City 


destruction, these nations would plunge the world into another 
great war by 1939. 

While fascism, communism, anarchy, and democracy jockeyed 
for dominance in Europe, America enjoyed unprecedented pros¬ 
perity in the 1920s. Historians have called the economic and cul¬ 
tural exuberance of the postwar years the Roaring Twenties; it 
was a time of jazz, speakeasies, radio, and film. The 1920s also saw 
the rise of the city as the emblem of the nation. Technology and 
machines were king in America, where the world s largest sky¬ 
scrapers could be erected in a year. This economic exhilaration 
came to a screeching halt with the stock market crash of October 
1929, which sent the entire world into a downward economic spi¬ 
ral known as the Great Depression, which lasted throughout the 
1930s. A reactionary backlash then occurred in both Europe and 
America: fascism in the former, and a conservative regionalism 
and isolationism in the latter. Nonetheless, the 1930s marked the 
advent in America of liberal social and economic programs, insti¬ 
tuted by Franklin Delano Roosevelts administration (1932-44). 
Believing that economic markets were inherently unstable, 
Roosevelt advocated the New Deal, which created millions of 
government-sponsored jobs, including many for artists. 

Perhaps the strongest defining influence for artists between 
the wars was the Great War itself and the technology, science, and 
Enlightenment rationalism that allowed it to be so devastating. 
The war directly produced Dada, a movement that created a 
nonsensical nihilistic art that attacked bourgeois values and

conventions, including a faith in technology. The Dadaists aimed 
to wipe the philosophical slate clean, leading the way to a new 
world order. Other artists embraced the modernity of the 
Machine Age (as this interwar period is sometimes called), seeing 
it as a means to create classless utopias; still others rejected it, 
seeking higher truths or a meaningful spirituality in an increas¬ 
ingly materialistic, soulless world. Both groups often turned to 
abstraction to implement their vision. Those supporting technol¬ 
ogy embraced the geometry and mechanical look of the Machine 
Age, while those who rejected it sought higher truths often using 
an organic or biomorphic vocabulary 

A second major force for the period was Sigmund Freud, 
whose theories about the unconscious and dreams were a forma¬ 
tive influence on Surrealism, a prevailing movement in the 1920s 
and 1930s. Like many abstract artists, the Surrealists sought to 
reveal invisible realities—not spiritual ones, but elemental univer¬ 
sal forces that drove all humans. These unseen realities were 
deeply embedded in the mind and symbolically revealed in 
dreams. Freud maintained that the conventions of civilization had 
repressed the elemental needs and desires that all people shared, 
and that this suppressed, invisible world of desires and sexual 
energy was fundamental to human behavior, the driving force 
within all humans. Freud acknowledged that civilized societies 
required the repression and channeling of those desires, but 
asserted that individuals paid a price in the form of neuroses and 
discontent. For Surrealist artists, as well as writers and intellectuals, 


Freud s theory of the unconscious confirmed the existence of 
realities unseen by the eye or unperceived by the conscious mind, 
and they served as the springboard for the development of 
Surrealist imagery and style. 

Politics also strongly shaped the art of the period. Many, if not 
most, avant-garde artists were socialists and Communists, or at 
least sympathizers, and their utopian dreams and aesthetic visions 
stem in part from these political ideologies. The narrative, repre¬ 
sentational murals of the great Mexican artists directly champion 
Communism, especially when paired with science, as the vehicle 
for creating a classless utopian society With the rise to power 
of Hitler and his National Socialist Party, many avant-garde 
artists turned their attention to making antifascist imagery and 
exposing the insane thinking and sadistic brutality of the new 
German government. 

This period also saw a growing interest in racial and ethnic 
identity, which was expressed in Mexican art and African- 
American art. The Mexican muralists were preoccupied with 
national identity, which they associated with the indigenous 
population, not Euro-Mexicans, while African Americans sought 
to uncover their heritage and culture. Just as Mary Cassatt, Berthe 
Morisot, and Margaret Julia Cameron sought to present women 
from a female viewpoint, obtaining very different results from 
male artists, the Mexicans and African Americans did the same for 
native and African cultures. These artists presented a very differ¬ 
ent image of and attitude toward non-European civilizations. 


984 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 















DADA 

The Great War halted much art making, as many artists were 
enlisted in their countries’ military service. Some of the finest 
were killed, such as the German Expressionist Marc and the 
Italian Futurist Boccioni. But the conflict also produced one art 
movement: Dada. Its name was chosen at random, the story goes, 
when two German poets, Richard Huelsenbeck and Hugo Ball, 
plunged a knife into a French-German dictionary and its point 
landed on dada , the French word for “hobbyhorse. ” The word’s 
association with childishness as well as the random violence of the 
poets’ act of word choice fit the postwar spirit of the movement 
perfectly. As the birth story of Dada suggests, the foundations of 
the movement lay in chance occurrences and the absurd. Fogic 
and reason, the Dada artists concluded, had led only to war. For 
them, the nonsensical and the ridiculous became tools to jolt their 
audience out of their bourgeois complacence and conventional 
thinking. The movement was profoundly committed to challeng¬ 
ing the status quo in politics as well as in culture. Dada began 
in 1916 in neutral Zurich, where a large number of writers and 
artists had sought refuge from the war and dedicated themselves, 
as Ball declared, “to remind the world that there are independent 
men, beyond war and nationalism, who live for other ideals. ” The 
Dada spirit spread across the West and to parts of Eastern Europe 
and would become a reference point for artists throughout the 
twentieth century. 

Zurich Dada: Jean Arp 

In Zurich, the poet Hugh Ball founded the Cabaret Voltaire in 
1916 as a performance center where writers and artists could 
protest the absurdity and wastefulness of the Great War. (The 
name Voltaire referred to the great Enlightenment philosophe 
whose ideas epitomized the logic that the Dadaists were attack¬ 
ing; see page 786.) Ball was soon joined by the Romanian poet 
Tristan Tzara, who became Dada’s most vociferous proponent. 
The artists and writers at the Cabaret Voltaire attacked the 
rational thinking that, in their view, produced the depraved civi¬ 
lization responsible for the war. Their target was all established 
values—political, moral, and aesthetic—and their goal was to 
level the old bourgeois order through “nonsense” and anarchy. In 
the end, they hoped to produce a tabula rasa , a clean slate, that 
would provide a new foundation for a fresh understanding of 
the world. 

The Cabaret Voltaire group, which included the Alsatian 
painter and poet Jean Arp, mounted boisterous performances. 
Wearing fanciful costumes, including primitive cardboard masks, 
they recited abstract phonetic poems of nonwords. (“Zimzum 
urallal zumzum urallal zumzum Zanzibar zumazall zam” went 
one line in Hugo Ball’s O Gadji Beri Bimba. To listen to Ball’s 
sound poems, go to .) The readings were 

virtually drowned out by an accompanying “music,” a cacophony 
of sounds, often the arrhythmic beating of a drum. The perform¬ 
ers’ chaos whipped the audiences into frenzies of catcalls, 


whistles, and shouts. Some evenings, Tzara harangued the 
audience with rambling, virtually incomprehensible Dada mani¬ 
festos. And, just as chance had named the Dada movement, it 
was used to create works themselves. Dada poems were “written” 
by pulling words out of a hat. Sometimes one poem was read 
simultaneously in different languages, or different verses of the 
same poem were read simultaneously in one language. The result¬ 
ing chance weaving of words together in a new way created a 
fresh unpredictable poetic fabric, both in sound and meaning. 
Some performances included danses negres and chants negres , as 
African dance and music were called, reflecting the group’s 
interest in so-called primitive cultures, cultures supposedly free 
of the evils of advanced civilization. Furthermore, the Dada 
artists believed that the directness and simplicity of African 
cultures put those cultures in touch with the primal essence of 
nature itself. Perhaps the most far-reaching influence of Dada 
performances was that they tore down the boundaries that had 
separated the various arts as visual artists, musicians, poets, actors, 
and writers worked together. Furthermore, the Dadaists 
destroyed any hierarchy of medium and genre. The Zurich 
Dadaists exhibited a broad range of avant-garde art, such as 
paintings by Klee and de Chirico (see pages 961 and 969, respec¬ 
tively)—as long as the art undermined bourgeois taste and 
standards. Most of the art presented at the Cabaret Voltaire and 
its successor, the Galerie Dada, was abstract. Among the strong¬ 
est visual artists in the group was Jean (or Hans—his name 
changed with the shifting national status of his hometown 
Strasbourg) Arp (1886-1966), whose abstract collages hung on 
the walls of the Cabaret Voltaire on opening night. Arp made 
his collages by dropping pieces of torn rectangular paper on the 
floor; where they fell determined the composition. Although he 
claimed that chance alone arranged the papers, Arp probably 
manipulated them. 

Arp believed that chance itself replicated nature. For him, life, 
despite the best-laid plans, was pure happenstance. Arp had been 
in Munich with Kandinsky (see pages 958-60), and there he 
adopted a mystical view of the world that envisioned a life force 
running through all things, binding them together in no particu¬ 
lar order. Fike Kandinsky, Arp sought to capture abstract univer¬ 
sal forces. This spiritual outlook can be seen in the low-relief 
sculptures he began making at about this time, such as The 
Entombment of the Birds and Butterflies (Head of Tzara) (fig. 
28.1). The different shapes were determined by doodling on 
paper. He then had a carpenter cut the shapes out of wood, which 
Arp painted and assembled into abstract compositions evoking 
plant and animal forms as well as clouds, cosmic gases, and celes¬ 
tial bodies. The title came last, and, as it suggests, the image can be 
also seen as a head, suggesting an elemental connection between 
humans and nature. 

The Cabaret Voltaire closed by the summer of 1916 and was 
replaced by a succession of other venues. Meanwhile, Tzara’s 
magazine, Dada , spread the word about the movement world¬ 
wide. By the end of the war in late 1918, Zurich had been aban¬ 
doned by many of the major artists, and by early 1919, Zurich

Dada had drawn to a close. Only after the war was over did Tzara 
hear that there was a New York Dada movement happening 
simultaneously, if not in name, at least in spirit. 


New York Dada: Marcel Duchamp 

New York Dada was centered on Marcel Duchamp and Francis 
Picabia, both of whom fled Paris and the war in 1915. Picabia was 
notorious for his satirical portraits in which the subject is repre¬ 
sented by a machine. In one, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz 
(see pages 936, 938, and 974) was portrayed as a camera, which 
takes on human qualities embodying Stieglitz s personality. The 
New York artists had no Cabaret Voltaire, no manifestos, and no 
performances, although they did hold a weekly salon at the home 
of the wealthy writer Walter Arensberg and his wife, Louise. 
From 1915 to 1916, they published their avant-garde art and ideas 
in a magazine entitled 291 , which was sponsored by Alfred 
Stieglitz, who as well as being a photographer was one of the first 
dealers of avant-garde art in America. The word Dada was never 
used at the time to describe their art; it was only applied in retro¬ 
spect because their spirit was similar to that found in Zurich. 


Perhaps the highlight of New York Dada is Duchamps 
Fountain (fig. 28.2). Duchamp submitted this sculpture to the 
1917 exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, an organi¬ 
zation begun several decades earlier to provide exhibition oppor¬ 
tunities for artists who did not conform to the conservative 
standards of New York s National Academy of Design, which 
had been the primary exhibition venue. Duchamp labeled his 
Fountain an “Assisted Readymade.” He took the term 
Readymade from American readymade clothing, and applied it 
to his sculptures that simply re-presented a found object, such as 
a snow shovel, which Duchamp hung from the ceiling and enti¬ 
tled In Advance of a Broken Arm. Objects that he “assisted,” by 
joining them with other objects, as in Bicycle Wheel (see fig. 
27.29), or by signing, as in Fountain , he called an “Assisted 
Readymade. ” As we saw in Chapter 27, Duchamp began working 
with found objects when he made his Bicycle Wheel in 1913, 
although he did not exhibit his Readymades and coin the term 
until he was in New York. Fountain was, in fact, a urinal manu¬ 
factured by J. L. Mott Iron Works in New York. Duchamp 
selected it, purchased it, turned it 90 degrees, set it on a pedestal, 
and crudely signed it with the fictitious name of “R. Mutt”—a 
reference not only to the manufacturer but also to the character 
Mutt in the popular Mutt and Jeff comic strip. The sculpture was

submitted to the society’s exhibition under Mutt’s name, not 
Duchamp’s. According to the society’s rules, anyone paying the 
$6 admission fee would have his or her work accepted. But 
Duchamp knew the hanging committee would not consider 
Fountain art and so not allow it to go on view, and when it was 
removed at the opening, his friends formed a rowdy procession 
that drew attention to its rejection. 

Duchamp continued the hoax of R. Mutt’s authorship of the 
work when he wrote an article about the piece in a small newspa¬ 
per he published with artist Beatrice Wood, The Blind Man , 
which only survived two issues but was well circulated in the 
avant-garde art world. The article was illustrated by a Stieglitz 
photograph of Fountain placed before a painting by Marsden 
Hartley (see fig. 27.33), an arrangement that underscored that the 
proper context for the appropriated urinal was the art world. The 
article defended Mutt’s right to create a Readymade: “Whether 
Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no 
importance. He chose. He took an ordinary article of life, placed 
it so that its useful significance disappeared under a new title and 
point of view...[creating] a new thought for that object.” 

Like all of Duchamp’s works, Fountain is rich in ideas, and it 
stands as one of the seminal works of twentieth-century art, 
although the original has disappeared. The sculpture is all about 
ideas. A viewer of Fountain must ask: What is the work of art? Is 
it the urinal, the provocation of submitting it to the exhibition, the 
flamboyant parade when it was removed from the show, or the 
article about it in The Blind Man ? Obviously, it is all of these 
things. Even the title is essential to the work, since it is an essen¬ 
tial part of the sculpture, and it allows Duchamp to make it clear 
that he is attacking one of the more revered art forms, the foun¬ 
tain, which is the centerpiece for most European towns and city 
squares and is, in some respects, a symbol for the tradition of fine 
art. The satirical title also reinforces the humor of the piece, an 
ingredient found in much of Duchamp’s work. Duchamp is 
telling us art can be humorous; it can defy conventional notions 
of beauty, and while intellectually engaging us in a most serious 
manner, it can also make us smile or laugh. Duchamp challenges 
the notion of what art is and the importance of technique or 
craft, as well as of the artist’s signature. He also asks how a 
work of art takes on meaning. Here, Duchamp emphasizes the 
relationship between context and meaning: By taking a urinal out 
of its normal context he has changed its meaning. (For a more 
extensive discussion of Duchamp, focusing on his Mona Lisa with 
a moustache, see the Introduction, pages xxvi-xxvii.) He even 
allows a viewer to assign meaning to the work, underscoring how 
this is a reality for all art, not just his. Ironically, unlike all art that 
preceded his, his Readymades have no aesthetic value and theor¬ 
etically no intended meaning. They are merely a device to 
launch ideas. 

Because Fountain is industrially manufactured and can be 
easily replaced if broken or lost (the original is lost, and in 1964 
the work was editioned, that is to say, several identical examples 
were produced), Duchamp also questions the significance 
attached to the uniqueness of a work of art. As we shall see, in the 


second half of the twentieth century, Duchamp will become the 
dominant figure in art as artists worldwide make what will be 
called Conceptual Art. For those artists, an idea or conceptual 
premise is the most important component of their work, in effect 
replacing the visual component. 

In contrast to Zurich Dada, New York Dada was very quiet. 
In Manhattan, the group was far removed from the war, and it did 
not have a political agenda. Its focus was largely on defining art, 
following Duchamp’s lead. More important, New York Dada was 
light-hearted and witty, as in Picabia’s humanoid machines and 
Duchamp’s Fountain. Dada art with a more acute sense of social 
mission was produced in wartorn Germany. 

Berlin Dada 

With the end of the war, the Dada poet Richard Huelsenbeck 
(1892-1974) left Zurich for Berlin. There, he found a moribund 
city, which like the rest of Germany was without food, money, 
medicine, or a future. Germans, especially the working class, 
loathed the military-industrial machine, which they felt had 
betrayed their interests by leading them into war. With the 
surrender, conditions worsened as Germany was punished by 
harsh and, some thought, unrealistic reparation demands. 
Inflation was rampant, and the value of the German currency 
plunged. Open class conflict in 1919 resulted in Communist-led 
worker uprisings in Berlin and Munich that were brutally 
repressed by right-wing armed units. The Weimar Republic gov¬ 
ernment, which had replaced the Kaiser (emperor) and repre¬ 
sented Germany’s first experience with democracy, failed to 
revive the economy. Its refusal in 1923 to make war reparations 
only resulted in further humiliation when the French military 
occupied the Ruhr Valley and seized the German assets in that 
coalmining region. 

For many, hope lay in the East, in Russia, where the Bolshevik 
Revolution established the prospect for a nationless world gov¬ 
erned by the proletariat. The artists and writers of Berlin Dada 
looked to international worker solidarity as Germany’s salvation. 
Here was a situation where Dada anarchy and nihilism could be 
put to practical use. Almost without exception, the Berlin Dada 
contingent made political art and were political activists, with 
some members, such as George Grosz and John Heartfield, join¬ 
ing the Communist Party. 

In Berlin, the poet Huelsenbeck employed the usual Dada 
devices. He created an organization, Club Dada, and published 
manifestos calling for the overthrow of the bourgeois establish¬ 
ment and the creation of an egalitarian society. The principal 
members of the group included Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Hoch, 
George Grosz, and John Heartfield. In 1920 they organized the 
first Dada International Fair, which featured worldwide Dada 
art. In the center of the fair, hanging from the ceiling, was an 
army-uniformed dummy with the head of a pig and wearing a 
sign saying “Hanged by the Revolution.” The work, a collabora¬ 
tion by Hausmann and Grosz, epitomized Dada’s abhorrence of 
the establishment. 


CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 987 



RAOUL HAUSMANN Hausmann (1886-1971) quickly became 
the leader of Berlin Dada, and was perhaps the most visually 
inventive, as can be seen in his 1920 assemblage Mechanical Head 
(Spirit of the Age) (fig. 28.3). He used found objects, which at 
the time were so foreign to the art world they were considered 
junk: a hairdresser s dummy, a collapsible cup, a crocodile wallet, 
labels, nails, a bronze segment of an old camera, a typewriter 
cylinder, a length of measuring tape, and a ruler. But now we see 
a new approach to making sculpture: The found objects are 
assembled together, an approach generally labeled “assemblage. ” 
Through this accumulation of objects, Hausmann presents a 
mindless, lifeless dummy, the contemporary German, whose 
actions and thoughts are molded by external forces, rendering it 
mechanical, even robotic, and with no personal identity. 
Hausmann claimed the typical German “has no more capabilities 
than those which chance has glued onto the outside of his skull; 
his brain remains empty. ” 

Hausmann, however, is best known for his use of language 
and collage. Like Hugo Ball in Zurich, he wrote and performed 
phonetic poems made according to the laws of chance. (To listen 
to his Dada poems, go to www.myartslab.com. ) His interest in 
words, letters, and sound led him in 1919 to innovative experi¬ 
ments with typography, in which he used different typefaces and

sizes for individual letters cut from magazines and newspapers, 
the shifts in scale indicating how the letter should be emphasized 
when sounded. These words were incorporated into ingenious 
collages made from material cut from different printed sources 
and rearranged in new contexts. 

HANNAH HOCH Some of the most elaborate and powerful 
Dada collages from the period were created by Hannah Hoch 
(1889-1978), who was Hausmann s companion from roughly 
1915 to 1922. Her Dada collages mimic manipulated portraits 
made for German soldiers. Individuals or entire battalions hired 
photographers to create fictitious portraits by photographing 
them, then cutting out their heads and pasting them onto pre¬ 
existing pictures of, for example, mounted militia. (See Primary 
Source , page 991.) Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the 
Last Weimar Beer Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany (fig. 28.4) 
speaks volumes about the agenda of Berlin Dada. Using a chaotic, 
cramped composition of crowds, words, machinery, and lettering 
of different sizes and styles, Hoch captures the hectic social, polit¬ 
ical, and economic intensity of the Weimar Republic. Her collage 
of photographs represents images of contemporary life made by 
photographers for the popular press. To Hoch and her Dada col¬ 
leagues, the camera was another machine that could be associated 
with the technological advances that had led to the war. With her 
“kitchen knife,” she “killed” the machine, and rearranged the 
imagery to create a hand-made photograph, thus humanizing 
the mechanical. The resulting image is a spinning, gearlike com¬ 
position with a portrait of the radical antiwar artist Kathe 
Kollwitz at the center. German masses and the new leaders of 
their government, the Weimar Republic, are pushed to the sides 
and villainously labeled as the “anti-Dada,” meaning against Dada 
and leftist politics. 

Collage, of course, was not new. But previously it had been 
used in a more refined manner, particularly by the Cubists, who 
had generally transformed the found materials taken from popu¬ 
lar culture into beautiful art (see fig. 28.12). With Hausmann and 
Hoch, however, collage retained the look and feeling of popular 
culture, especially the advertising look seen in the mass media. 
The Berlin Dadaists did not call their works collages, which sug¬ 
gests fine art. Instead, they labeled them photomontages, which 
evoked machine-made, mass-produced images. Their photomon¬ 
tages looked like antiart, and their powerfully abrupt composi¬ 
tions embodied the group s political stridency. 

KATHE KOLLWITZ Though not a Dada artist, Kathe Kollwitz 
(1867-1945), spotlighted by Hoch in Cut with the Kitchen Knife , 
provided an important precedent for the political and expressive 
nature of Berlin Dada and is often simply labeled an 
Expressionist. A generation older than Hoch, she was denied 
admission to the Berlin Academy because she was a woman. She 
studied at a womens art school, and after marrying a doctor, 
settled in a working-class neighborhood in Berlin. There, her 
husband treated the poor, who became the subject of her art. 
She shunned painting as an elitist medium of the academy and

the bourgeoisie, and instead made drawings and prints, which 
could be mass-produced and circulated to wider audiences. For 
the Berlin Dada artists, who were committed to clear political 
messages, Kollwitz was an inspiration. Although for the 1920s, 
her representational style was somewhat conservative, her mes¬ 
sage was influential, for she had created a large body of powerful 
Expressionist work that conveyed her sympathies with the work¬ 
ing class, and victims of war. In addition, her imagery contains far 
more women than does that of her male counterparts and reflects 
her socialist vision of women playing an equal role in the ideal 
Germany of the future. Typical of her Expressionist style of stri¬ 
dent marks, strong value contrasts, and powerful emotions is her 
antiwar poster Never Again War! (fig. 28.5), a lithograph pub¬ 
lished in 1924 and embodying personal content, since Hoch lost a 
son in World War I. In 1920, Hoch became the first woman ever 
admitted to the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts. 

GEORGE GROSZ An early maker of Dada photomontages, 
George Grosz (1893-1959), provides a clear example of the 
Expressionist element in Berlin Dada and its direct connection 
with Kollwitz. (Like Hoch, Grosz is often labeled a postwar 
Expressionist.) Grosz, who had been seriously wounded twice in 


the war and had suffered a mental breakdown, was especially bit¬ 
ter about the disastrous course charted by Germany’s leaders. 
Upon convalescing and returning to Berlin, he was stylistically 
inspired by the expressive Cubism of the Futurists and worked 
in this style at the same time as he produced his more radical 
photomontages. A fine example of his Cubist style is Germany , A 
Winter's Tale (fig. 28.6) of 1918. Here, the city of Berlin forms the 
kaleidoscopic, chaotic background for several large figures, which 
are superimposed on it as in a collage. They include the marionet- 
telike “good citizen” at his table and the sinister forces that have 
molded him: a hypocritical clergyman, a brutal general, and an 
evil schoolmaster. For Grosz, this triumverate reflects the deca¬ 
dent world of the bourgeoisie that he, like many German intellec¬ 
tuals, hoped would be overthrown by Communism. In 1920, he, 
along with Kollwitz and other artists, joined the International 
Workers Aid, a Communist organization.

Hannah Hoch (1889-1978) 

From an interview with Edouard Roditi 

In an interview with art historian Edouard Roditi , the German Dada 
artist Hannah Hoch talks about the inspiration for her Dada photo¬ 
montages. 

A ctually, we borrowed the idea from a trick of the official photog¬ 
raphers of the Prussian army regiments. They used to have elab¬ 
orate oleolithographed mounts, representing a group of uniformed 
men with a barracks or a landscape in the background, but with the 
faces cut out; in these mounts, the photographers then inserted pho¬ 
tographic portraits of the faces of their customers, generally coloring 


them later by hand. But the aesthetic purpose, if any, of this very 
primitive kind of photomontage was to idealize reality, whereas the 
Dada photomonteur set out to give to something entirely unreal all the 
appearances of something real that had actually been photographed. ... 

Our whole purpose was to integrate objects from the world of 
machines and industry in the world of art. Our typographical collages 
or montages also set out to achieve similar effects by imposing, on 
something which could only be produced by hand, the appearances 
of something that had been entirely composed by a machine; in an 
imaginative composition, we used to bring together elements bor¬ 
rowed from books, newspapers, posters, or leaflets, in an arrange¬ 
ment that no machine could yet compose.

Cologne Dada 

In the city of Cologne, Dada initially took its lead from Berlin, 
but it was never as political. Dada artists here were intrigued 
by Freud s theory of the unconscious and favored figures that 
combined mechanical and human forms (sometimes called 
mechanomorphic art), reminiscent of the work of Duchamp and 
Picabia. The key Cologne Dada artists were Max Ernst 
(1891-1976) and Johannes Baargeld (a pseudonym based on 
the German word Bar geld, meaning "cash”), both of whom 
appropriated the Berlin artists’ collage techniques. Ernst and 
Baargeld were iconoclasts, not social evangelists, who delighted in 
submitting their witty low-end irreverent collages to the staid 
Cologne Kunstverein Exhibition in 1919, creating a scandal. 
When prohibited from showing there the following year, Ernst 
mounted a solo exhibition at a nearby brewery, forcing visitors to 
walk past the lavatory to get to the "gallery,” where the central 
work was a sculpture that visitors were instructed to destroy with 
an axe he provided. 

Typical of Ernst s work from this very productive period is 
1 Copper Plate 1 Zinc Plate 1 Rubber Cloth 2 Calipers 1 Drainpipe 
Telescope 1 Piping Man (fig. 28.7), a gouache, ink, and pencil draw¬ 
ing on an illustration from a 1914 book about chemistry equip¬ 
ment. With a line here and a dab of paint there, Ernst transformed 
the picture of laboratory utensils into bizarre robotic figures set 
in a stark symbol-filled landscape. Perhaps we should say dream- 
scape, for the glazed-over stares and skewed de Chirico-like per¬ 
spective, which culminates in a mystifying square, give this little 
collage an elemental power that suggests some otherworldly 
sphere—one of the imagination. Ernst was influenced by others 
who had made dream imagery, but he was also familiar with de 
Chirico s metaphysical paintings, to which he was introduced by 
his friend Jean Arp. The dreamlike quality of Ernsts image 
endows his figures with heavy psychological overtones. Not sur¬ 
prisingly, Ernst was fascinated by Sigmund Freud s theories about 
the unconscious and the importance of dreams. 

Through Arp, Ernst was put in contact with two leaders of the 
Paris Dada movement, poets Andre Breton and Paul Eluard, both

OUR 

























of whom had also come under Freud s spell, entranced by the idea 
that the unconscious contained realities that had been suppressed 
by civilization. In 1921, they arranged for Ernst to show his Dada 
collages at a small avant-garde exhibition in Paris, where they 
made such a sensation he was hailed as the “Einstein of painting. ” 
The following year, Ernst emigrated to Paris. In 1924, Breton 
issued his Surrealist Manifesto , anointing Ernsts 1921 show, 
because of its dreamlike images, as the first Surrealist exhibition. 

Paris Dada: Man Ray 

The transition from Dada to Surrealism was well under way by 
1922, and it occurred in Paris. Dada had established a foothold in 
the French capital with the return of Duchamp at the end of 1918 
and with the arrival of Picabia from Barcelona in 1919. As in 
Zurich, the thrust behind Paris Dada came from the literary con¬ 
tingent. Inspired by Tzara s Dada magazine, three young poets— 
Louis Aragon, Andre Breton, and Philippe Soupault—founded a 
journal called Litterature. It was so avant-garde that there was 
hardly anything in it that the literary establishment would con¬ 
sider literature. In addition to phonetic poems by Tzara, it 
included Breton and Soupault s collaborative poem “Les Champs 
magnetique” (“Magnetic Fields”) of 1920, which was written in a 
stream-of-consciousness style that was derived from working 
sessions lasting up to ten hours. 

One artist who moved in and out of the Paris Dada circle was 
the independent American Man Ray (1890-1976). He had 
befriended Duchamp in New York, participated in New York 
Dada, and followed Duchamp to Paris in 1921. Best known as a 
photographer, Man Ray was extraordinarily inventive and 
worked in many mediums, some, such as airbrush painting, being 
quite innovative. Most important, Man Ray was the first artist to 
consistently use photography within a Dada context, often using 
the same conceptual premises, favoring idea over technique, as are 
found in Duchamp s work, thus freeing the medium from the 
merely representational restrictions placed on it by fine-art pho¬ 
tographers. Man Ray helped establish photography, at least 
within Dada and Surrealist circles, as a medium that was viewed 
on a par with painting and sculpture. 

In 1922, Man Ray had a major impact on the development of 
photography, as well as on Dada and abstract art, when he popu¬ 
larized the photogram—a one-of-a-kind cameraless photograph 
made by putting objects directly on photographic paper and then 
exposing both the object and paper to light (fig. 28.8). Solid 
objects block light from striking the white paper, so they appear 
white in the image, while the spaces between and around the 
objects become black, since there is nothing to prevent the light 
from exposing the paper. Tzara dubbed Man Ray s print a “rayo- 
graph,” and that year, using cover prints (photographic copies of 
the original print) made by Man Ray, Tzara published a limited- 
edition book, entitled Champs delicieux (“Delicious Fields,” a pun 
on “Magnetic Fields”), containing 12 rayographs. 

Our reproduction is one of these untitled works, which 
reveals the silhouettes of a brush and comb, a sewing pin, a coil of 


paper, and a strip of fabric, among the identifiable items. The 
image, like much of Man Ray s work, helps demonstrate the close 
relationship between the random and defiant art of Dada and 
the evocative, often sensual, art of Surrealism. The objects appear 
ghostlike and mysterious and float in a strange environment 
where darks and lights have been reversed and a haunting overall 
darkness prevails. Shapes and lines move in and out of dark 
shadows, sometimes vibrating, as with the brush-and-comb 
silhouette, other times crisply stated, as in the center oval. Because 
Man Ray exposed the paper with a light bulb that he moved 
several times during the process, he created multiple light sources, 
which caused the edges of some objects to shimmer and allowed 
other forms to recede back in space instead of just existing as flat 
silhouettes. His pictures, as with the Surrealist art that would 
follow, are a magical blend of the real and nonreal. We feel the 
presence of a real comb and sewing pin, and yet they seem to exist 
in a poetic otherworldly realm, even evoking the inner world of 
the mind and black-and-white world of dreams. Just as strange 
and inexplicable is the relationship of these objects and shapes to 
one another.

992 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




Man Ray also used the same process to make films, which have 
the same dreamlike quality as his rayographs. At Tzara s invita¬ 
tion, he participated in what turned out to be the final major Dada 
event in Paris, La Soiree de la Coeur de la Barbe (The Bearded 
Heart Soiree ) in 1923. To make his film, Man Ray sprinkled sand 
on a segment of unexposed film, and, nails, and tacks on another, 
creating a three-minute abstract movie titled The Return to 
Reason (to view the film, visit www.myartslab.com) , an ironic title 
because the hallucinatory flickering of white objects floating in 
pitch-blackness creates a sense of chaos that is far from rational. 
To flesh out the film, Man Ray added segments of a carousel 
photographed at night, a tic-tac-toe-gridlike mobile dancing with 
its own shadow, and a nude model dissolved in harsh striped 
lighting, which are equally abstract and dreamlike. Like the rayo¬ 
graphs, the film represented a new way to view the world, one 
that was essentially Surrealist, although the term had yet to be 
coined or the movement recognized. This short movie, Man Rays 
first, not only introduced film to the Parisian fine-art world, but 
it also helped spawn a flurry of experimental films by other 
artists. Shortly after Man Ray s movie was screened that evening, 
a riot broke out when Breton, Eluard, and Soupault, all uninvited, 
stormed the stage screaming that Dada was dead. Though Dada 
continued to provide the intellectual foundation for challenging 
art throughout the century, the spirit of the moment was clearly 
shifting away from chance and nonsense to the psychological 
investigations of Surrealism. 

SURREALISM 

Surrealism existed in spirit, if not in name, well before 1924, but 
the movement was formally launched by Breton that year with his 
Surrealist Manifesto. Surrealism, Breton wrote, is "pure psychic 
automatism, by which it is intended to express, either verbally, or 
in writing, or in any other way, the true functioning of thought. 
Thought expressed in the absence of any control exerted by rea¬ 
son, and outside all moral and aesthetic considerations. ” Banished 
was the Neoclassical god of reason, the sureness of logic, and the 
need to portray an observable reality. Also gone was Dada 
nihilism, replaced by an intensive exploration of the unconscious. 
Surrealists argued that we see only a surface reality. More impor¬ 
tant was uncovering the reality that, as Freud maintained, resided 
in the deep-seated secrets and desires of the unconscious mind. 
For Freud, the basic human desires, particularly the sexual ones, 
that define our individual identities are repressed by the conven¬ 
tions of civilization but are revealed in dreams. Random dream 
images are, for Freud, charged with meaning and provide the 
"royal road to the unconscious.” They contain symbols of our 
desires and anxieties. Using his own and his patients’ dreams as 
"raw material,” Freud decoded dream images into what he 
believed to be their true meaning, claiming sexual desires or 
concerns were often disguised as ordinary objects. A vase, for 
example, is a symbol of female sexuality, the vagina, while a tall 
building or a mountain suggests phallic maleness. 


Bretons manifesto proposed several ways to tap into the 
unconscious. He encouraged the use of dreamlike images, the 
juxtaposition of unrelated objects that would jar the imagination, 
and stream-of-consciousness writing. He called for "the future 
resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seem¬ 
ingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreal- 
ity.” He emphasized the concept of creating "the marvelous,” 
images, either verbal or visual, that are mysterious, chance, and 
poetic, and that jolt the audience into a new, unknown plane of 
reality—surreality. 

Surrealism was first a literary style. Breton traced its roots to 
several sources, including the comte de Lautreamont s 1869 novel 
Chants de Maldoror , which included wondrous passages of sur¬ 
real images, the most famous perhaps being "as beautiful as a 
chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an 
operating table. ” Breton s literary circle delighted in such "chance 
encounters” of words, even devising a game in which each partic¬ 
ipant provided words for a sentence, not knowing what had 
already been written. One such game produced "The exquisite 
corpse will drink the new wine,” and "Exquisite Corpse” became 
the game s name. Surrealist visual artists played Exquisite Corpse 
as well. Folding a piece of paper, each artist drew on his or her 
segment without seeing what the others had done, only where 
they had left off. The result was a provocative image of unrelated 
objects or a strange form. But visual art had little place in Breton s 
manifesto, and visual artists were only mentioned as a footnote, 
appearing in a single sentence. Among those listed were Ernst, 
Man Ray, de Chirico, and Picasso. 

Picasso and Surrealism 

Perhaps the most surprising name on Breton s list is Picasso s. The 
Dada artists found little of interest in the analytic logical thinking 
of the Cubists. But Breton saw Picasso s Cubism as the first step 
toward loosening the grip of reality on the artistic imagination, 
and he declared Picasso s 1907 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (see fig. 
27.5) one of the first Surrealist images. Beginning in the mid- 
1920s, Picassos work paralleled that of the Surrealists. They 
shared many symbols and myths, mostly sexual, including the 
female praying mantis, which eats it male partner upon mating, 
and the suffering, tortured male minotaur, which has the head of 
a bull on the body of man. But Picasso was very independent, and 
though he provided artwork for Surrealist publications and par¬ 
ticipated in some Surrealist shows, he did not consider himself 
a Surrealist. 

With Bretons 1924 Surrealist Manifesto , the primal sexual 
forces seen in Les Demoiselles and smoldering beneath the surface 
of many of his Synthetic Cubist paintings of the mid- to late 1910s 
burst into the foreground of Picasso s works, as seen in Three 
Dancers (fig. 28.9), made in 1925, less than a year after Breton 
published his manifesto. These are not the Three Graces, but 
rather disquieting nudes engaged in a strange performance. The 
figure in the center—the most conventionally rendered—appears 
at one moment to be completing a pirouette, at the next moment

to be crucified. The contorted figure to the left has been reduced 
to an assemblage of abstruse hieroglyphic forms, which never 
quite coalesce into a single meaning. Her head is shaped like a 
quarter-moon, and it has been placed against a backdrop of a 
night sky filled with stars as represented by the abstracted fleurs- 
de-lis of the wallpaper. Some scholars claim the head resembles a 
Torres Strait, New Guinea mask that Picasso had in his personal 
collection of tribal art, and is thus a reflection of the artist s inter¬ 
est in the expressive primordial power of so-called primitive art, 
which Surrealists felt penetrated into the deepest recesses of the 
mind. The figure on the right is the most sedate or controlled of 
the three, causing some art historians to view the dancers as 
emblems of love, sex, and death. At every turn, Cubist fracturing 
dissolves the forms into disorienting shapes and colors, permit¬ 
ting multiple interpretations of the scene. What seems to be a 
dance rehearsal in a light-filled studio at one moment turns into 


a midnight Dionysian bacchanal at the next. What remains consis¬ 
tent, however, is the pivotal role of the female body, whether as a 
symbol of erotic athleticism, threatening sexual frenzy, or spiri¬ 
tual suffering. Just as Freud attributed to the female body the 
power to incite desire as well as dread in men, Picasso, like the 
Surrealists, places the female form at the service of a male viewer s 
contradictory libidinal impulses. 

WELDED SCULPTURE Picasso also turned to sculpture to 
express his urge to portray the unseen deep-seated psychological 
passions that drive physical urges, and it led him to revolutionize 
sculpture for a second time (see page 954). By late 1928, he was 
welding metal, which he experimented with for the next five 
years, starting a trend that by the 1940s established welded steel 
as a major sculptural process rivaling cast bronze and chiseled 
stone. Picasso began working in the medium when he decided to 
make sculpture based on the linear drawing of the figures in his

current paintings, figures that were in effect skeletal stick figures. 
The resulting three-dimensional sculptures were made up of 
metal rods that represented the painted lines, and they looked like 
a line drawing in space. 

Gradually, Picasso turned from metal rods to working with 
metal in a variety of shapes and sizes, including the use of found 
objects, as seen in Head of a Woman (fig. 28.10) from 1929-30, 
which was made from colanders, springs, iron, and sheet metal. 
Picasso is still drawing in space, as seen in the hair, face, skull, and 
body—if this is indeed what these abstract shapes are. He has 
pared his figure down to a barebones essence, peeling away the 
superficial layers of physicality to reveal the psychological core of 
the woman that lies beneath, a rather strident, threatening psy¬ 
chology that reflects a male perception and fear of the opposite 
sex. The sculpture s overall resemblance to African masks, and the 
use of tribal hieroglyphic notations for different parts of the body, 
such as the stick legs, reinforce its elemental quality. 

To do his welding, Picasso hired fellow Spaniard Julio 
Gonzalez (1876-1942), who had learned the skill in a Renault 
automobile factory By the 1930s, Gonzalez was making his own 
work, such as Head (fig. 28.11) of around 1935, which would 
garner him a reputation as the worlds foremost practitioner 
of welded sculpture. Gonzalez specialized in figures and heads, 


which, like Picasso s Head ofa Woman , project primitive, psycho¬ 
logical, and hallucinatory qualities. Here, the sculptor reduces the 
figure to a pernicious clamplike mouth, stalklike eyes, spiky hair, 
and frazzled face (or is it the mind?), all attached to a moonlike 
crescent not only suggesting a skull but also the cosmos, a paral¬ 
lel we saw Jean Arp make as well in The Entombment of the Birds 
and Butterflies (see fig. 28.1) 

Surrealism in Paris: Spurring the Imagination 

In 1925, Breton, like everyone, was having doubts about the possi¬ 
bility of Surrealist painting or sculpture. Many argued that the 
visual arts, unlike writing, did not allow for a stream of conscious¬ 
ness since artists always had the work in front of them and, while 
creating, could see where they had been and think about where 
they were at that moment. The resulting imagery might seem 
surreal, but the method was not. Initially, many of the visual 
artists Breton championed relied on automatic drawing and 
chance to produce their images. In late 1925, Breton organized the 
first Surrealist exhibition, which featured Ernst, Picasso, Andre 
Masson, and Joan Miro, but also included de Chirico, Klee, Man 
Ray, and Arp. 

MAX ERNST The use of automatic drawing had been initiated 
by the French painter Andre Masson (1896-1987) the year before, 
in 1924. In this process, Masson first made a series of lines while 
in a trancelike state, lines that he then used to spur the imagina¬ 
tion to further develop the image. In 1926, he began prompting 
his unconscious by also randomly putting glue on his canvases 
and then sprinkling sand over the surface, the sand adhering 
where there was glue. The result of these chance techniques was 
the creation of mysterious environments inhabited by primitive 
organic forms, suggesting both the origin of life and the powerful 
universal urges that drive it. 

Not to be outdone by Masson, Ernst in 1925 developed frot- 
tage, one of several devices he developed throughout his career to 
spur his imagination. Frottage consists of rubbing graphite, 
crayon, or charcoal over paper placed on an object, such as floor¬ 
boards, chair caning, or pressed flowers, and then discerning an 
image in the irregular pattern of the wood grain or in the botani¬ 
cal geometry When wiping paint over canvas, the technique is 
called grattage. In either case, the process often spurred Ernst s 
imagination to create a primeval forest filled with birds, animals, 
and bizarre, frightening creatures. While the pictures often have a 
mythic force similar to Masson s imagery, they are also filled with 
a frenetic sexual energy Grattage is the basis for Die Game Stadt 
(The Entire City) (fig. 28.12) of 1935-36, one of several paintings 
made on this theme at about this time for which Ernst placed 
canvas over boards and then rubbed dried paint over the surface. 
The result in each case is an austere and massive Mayan-like struc¬ 
ture evoking an extinct monumental civilization, swallowed by 
the forces of nature and time, as suggested in this picture by the 
dominance of the enormous acidic-colored celestial body in 
the sky and the crawling animallike plantlife with lush buds in the

foreground. A dark mood of twilight prevails, underscoring a 
sense of futility about humans trying to permanently achieve the 
goals of their primary, elemental desires. 

JOAN MIRO A Catalan from Barcelona, Joan Miro (1893-1983) 
came to Paris in 1920 and took a studio next to Massons. Soon 
after, through a hole in their adjoining wall, Masson whispered to 
Miro to go see Breton, not Picasso—because “he was the future. ” 
Within a short time Miro had abandoned Cubism and begun 
painting from his imagination. (Actually, he claimed he was work¬ 
ing from hallucinations brought on by starvation—“I was living 
on a few dry figs a day ”) He adopted Masson s wiry line and the 
childlike drawing and atmospheric quality of Klee (see fig. 27.16). 
Miro s pictures became abstractions of biomorphic and geometric 
forms set against a minimal color field that suggested a landscape 
or watery environment. Miros paintings became increasingly 
abstract, as seen in Composition (fig. 28.13), a 1933 oil. The 
work was one in a series based on collages on cardboard made 
from images cut out of catalogues with the idea that the shape 


and even details of the objects would fire his imagination. The 
setting of Composition is a hazy atmospheric environment of 
washes, suggesting the same kind of primeval landscape as in 
Masson s abstractions. This eerie world is populated by strange 
curvilinear floating forms that suggest prehistoric and micro¬ 
scopic creatures, as well as spirits, ghosts, or souls. We can even 
find a story in places, such as two figures playing with or fighting 
over a ball in the upper left corner. Or are they? Other features 
in the painting express ideas about sex, struggle, and fear. Miro 
uses a minimal vocabulary, which includes color as well as form, 
to create a mythic image evoking humans’ most primal urges 
and needs. 

Representational Surrealism: Magritte and Dali 

Initially, Breton s strongest support was for an abstract Surrealism 
that was based on chance, spontaneity, and trance. Over the next 
decade, however, artists with all kinds of styles would move in 
and out of the movement, most abandoning it, in part because of

the groups strong socialist and Communist stance, but also 
because of Breton himself, who was rather controlling and func¬ 
tioned as though he were the Pope of Surrealism, capriciously 
anointing or not anointing and even excommunicating artists as 
Surrealists for the flimsiest of reasons. 

RENE MAGRITTE By the late 1920s, more and more artists 
were working in a representational or quasi-representational 
style. One such was Rene Magritte (1898-1967), who was from 
Brussels. There, he was a member of the Surrealist circle, a 
group of artists and intellectuals who were also very involved 


with Communism. Magritte spent 1927 to 1930 in Paris, but 
Breton never officially recognized him as a Surrealist. He then 
returned to Belgium, where he spent the remainder of his life, 
not achieving fame until late in his career. His The False Mirror 
(fig. 28.14), painted in 1928, reads like a manifesto of Surrealism, 
proclaiming the superior reality of the unconscious mind. We 
see an uncanny close-up of an eye, which reflects a distant sky. 
The iris, however, is transformed into an eerie eclipsed sun, 
behind which, Magritte suggests, lies the unconscious, which 
perceives the reality of things. The eye absorbs only the visual, 
not the real, world.

28.1 5 Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel. A still from the film 
An Andalusian Dog (Un Cloien Andalou). 1929. France 

SALVADOR DALI Arriving in Paris a few years after Magritte 
was another major representational Surrealist. Salvador Dali 
(1904-1989) came from Madrid, where he had already developed 
a meticulously detailed Realist style heavily based on the psycho¬ 


logical complexes that Freud described in his writings. He made a 
grand entrance into the world of Parisian Surrealism with his 17- 
minute film An Andalusian Dog (see www.myartslab.comh which 
he made with fellow Spaniard, the filmmaker Luis Bunuel 
(1900-1983). The movie opens with Bunuel on a balcony with a 
woman and, as a cloud mysteriously passes behind them, the cam¬ 
era goes to a close-up of an eye, we assume the womans, which is 
then dramatically sliced by a straight razor. This opening scene 
has been interpreted as a reference to the Oedipus complex and 
fear of castration, which is symbolized by a fear of blindness, two 
major themes in Freud s writings about male psychological devel¬ 
opment. The entire film, which consists of one unexplainable, 
bizarre sequence after another, lends itself to similar Freudian 
analysis. To produce their Surrealist effects, Dali and Bunuel rely 
on montage, juxtaposing unrelated objects to create dream 
sequences that constantly put objects into new contexts designed 
to generate the “marvelous” and to jolt the unconscious. In one 
famous sequence, a needley sea urchin morphs into a womans 
hairy armpit; in another, a mans mouth first disappears, then 
becomes a womans crotch; and in yet other, ants swam over a 
hand appearing in a crack in a door. In yet another famous 
sequence, the film s protagonist drags across a room two priests 
and two grand pianos, each containing a putrefying dead donkey

(fig. 28.15), a sequence suggesting among other things the admon¬ 
ishments of the church about sex and how they suppress basic 
human urges. 

Similar themes and Freudian psychology appear in Dalis 
visual art. Dali made his paintings using a process he called 
“paranoiac-critical”—“[a] spontaneous method of irrational 
knowledge based upon the interpretative-critical association of 
delirious phenomena.” He created paintings in a frenzy, a self- 
induced paranoid state where he would begin with a single object 
in mind. Then, he would respond to that object and so on, devel¬ 
oping a mysterious image reflecting an irrational process that 
released the unconscious. The Persistence of Memory (fig. 28.16) 
began with the strange amorphous head with an elongated trailing 
neck lying on the ground. A plate of soft Camembert cheese then 
inspired him to paint the soft pocket watches. While allowing no 
certain “final” reading, the picture evokes a host of associations, 
the most obvious being the crippling passage of time that leads to 
inevitable deterioration and death, although the title suggests we 
are looking backward to the past, not forward to the future. Many 
scholars interpret the flaccid watches as symbols of impotence. In 
any case, Dali has created a provocative dreamscape of mysterious 
objects that can be read as metaphors for the deepest desires, fears, 
and anxieties, especially sexual, of the mind, and that can unleash 
multiple interpretations from a viewer s own unconscious. 

Surrealism and Photography 

Photographers, following Man Ray s lead, were discovering that 
their medium, which could both manipulate reality and create 
dreamlike sequences, were perfect vehicles for Surrealism. Many 
major photographers, not in Breton s circle, were deeply affected 
by Surrealism. One of the most famous outsiders was the 
Frenchman Henri Cartier-Bresson, who neither manipulated nor 
staged his images. 

HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON Cartier-Bresson(1908-2004) made 
some of the most extraordinary images of the twentieth century. 
Trained as a painter, he turned to photography in the early 1930s 
when, influenced by the Surrealists, he sought to find the extraor¬ 
dinary in the ordinary and decided that the best means for accom¬ 
plishing this was through photography. Armed with the new 
small, portable 35mm Leica camera, he took to the street to 
photograph what he called “the decisive moment,” which he 
defined as “the creative fraction of a second when you are taking 
a picture,” and “using intuition you ask your artistic question and 
decide almost simultaneously.” We can see this decisive moment 
in his Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare (fig. 28.17) of 1932. All over 
the world, Cartier-Bresson made photograph after photograph 
that miraculously captured the same supernatural magic we see in 
this fleeting, ghostlike image of a silhouetted man inexplicably 
suspended in midair. A master of strong value contrasts, Cartier- 
Bresson was able to transform stones, ladder, and arcs into strange 
hieroglyphic shapes that materialize out of the water. Like Dali 
and Ernst, he establishes a powerful eerie dialogue among objects,

such as the man, clock, ladder, and reflections, sending the mind 
on an endless journey of associations and interpretations. 

The Surrealist Object 

When Joan Miro began work on his Composition , he started with 
an image that, like a dream, took him on a journey of psycholog¬ 
ical exploration and formal invention. Surrealists created objects 
that would initiate such journeys for viewers as well as for them¬ 
selves. In fact, some of the most succinct Surrealist artworks were 
fetishistic objects, mysterious poetic things, that were found and 
created, and had no narrative, but jolted the unconscious and 
spawned infinite associations, mostly sexual and often violent. As 
early as 1921, Man Ray had already made one of the first 
Surrealist objects, The Gif (fig. 28.18), a gift for the composer 
Erik Satie. The work is nothing more than tacks glued onto the 
flat side of a clothing iron. It is a shocking dislocation of both a 
household item and hardware that creates something unidentifi¬ 
able, without logic or narrative, but filled with innuendoes of 
violence, pain, and sex.

Probably the most famous Surrealist object was made by 
Meret Oppenheim (1913-1985). Oppenheim, the daughter of a 
Jungian psychologist, went to Paris as an 18-year-old in 1932. For 
a period she was Man Ray s model and assistant. Inspired by an 
off-hand comment she made when lunching with Picasso in 1936, 


she covered a teacup, saucer, and spoon with gazelle fur and called 
it Object (fig. 28.19), although Breton, when he included it in a 
Surrealist exhibition, retitled it Luncheon in Fur , punning on 
Manets sexually fraught Luncheon on the Grass (see fig. 25.10). 
Oppenheim presents us with eroticism offered and eroticism 
denied, for, individually, fur and beverage are sensual, but juxta¬ 
posed as they are, they are disconcerting, if not outright repulsive. 
The fur anthropomorphizes the porcelain and spoon, and sug¬ 
gests, among other things, pubic hair. The work is designed to 
trigger the unconscious, to evoke infinite associations that deal 
with the repressed realities of eroticism, sensuality, desire, and 
anxiety. Using minimal means, Oppenheim created the “mar¬ 
velous” that takes a viewer into the realm of the surreal. 

ORGANIC SCULPTURE OF 
THE 1 93 OS 

The abstraction of such Surrealists as Masson and Miro inspired 
many artists to search for universal truths residing beneath the 
surface of things. As had the Romantic landscape painters of 
the previous century, they focused on nature, trying to pry loose 
the unseen pulse of the cosmos that coursed through the natural 
world. To reveal these higher truths and realities, a number of 
artists, including Alexander Calder in Paris and Henry Moore 
and Barbara Hepworth in England, turned to working with 
abstract organic forms. Often, they showed in Surrealist exhibi¬ 
tions and were occasionally labeled Surrealists, especially since 
their work dealt with hidden realities. But despite many parallels, 
their interests were quite different from Breton s as they evolved 
in the 1930s. Breton was more concerned with the psychology of 
anxiety, desire, and sex, while the artists working with abstract 
organic forms were more interested in the powerful forces of the 
universe. With the exception of Calder, they did not use chance or

other devices to spur their imaginations. In some respects, their 
work relates more to Malevich, Kandinsky, and Mondrian than to 
the card-carrying Breton Surrealists. Some artists, like Jean Arp, 
whom we met in a Dada context but who became one of the first 
Surrealists, abandoned Bretons circle in the early 1930s and 
joined an international Paris-based group called Abstraction- 
Creation, which was dedicated to abstract art. Similarly, Miro as 
well, without changing style, quit the Surrealist movement, claim¬ 
ing he was not a Surrealist. 

Alexander Calder in Paris 

Arp convinced his friend Alexander Calder (1898-1976) to 
become a member of Abstraction-Creation as well. Calder, an 
American from Philadelphia, had settled in Paris in 1926, where 
he also befriended Miro and the abstract Dutch painter Piet 
Mondrian, whom we shall meet shortly. In the early 1930s, he 
started making mobiles, a name that Duchamp gave his kinetic 
sculptures. Calder s first mobiles were propelled by motors, but 


later mobiles were constructed of painted sheet metal attached to 
metal wires that were hinged together and perfectly balanced. 
With the slightest gust of air, the mobile seems to glide, tilting and 
turning in space. Some of his mobiles make a chiming sound as 
‘hammers’ periodically swing around to strike gonglike elements. 
The mobiles vary in size from tabletop models to others with a 
30-foot span that are suspended from a ceiling. 

Like Miro and Arp, Calder generally used organic shapes, as 
seen in Lobster Trap and Fish Tail (fig. 28.20) from 1939. The 
forms suggest marine life, but generally they are abstract and, like 
Miros paintings, simultaneously suggest the microscopic and 
macroscopic. The black forms in Lobster Trap can be seen as a 
school of fish, but viewed together suggest something skeletal, 
even primeval. Calder was inspired to develop kinetic sculpture to 
suggest growth and cosmic energy. He kept his colors basic, gen¬ 
erally using primary and secondary colors, as well as black and 
white. All colors stem from these, so Calder s palette symbolized 
the basic building blocks of life, a notion he shared with 
Mondrian (see page 1005), whose Paris studio he visited in 1930.

CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 1001 





















Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth 
in England 

The organic abstract style favored by Miro, Arp, and Calder 
jumped the English Channel in the 1930s, surfacing in the work 
of Henry Moore (1898-1986) and Barbara Hepworth. Moore 
studied at the Royal College of Art in London from 1921 to 
1925, and in the following five years, from extensive museum 
visits in England and on the Continent, and through art publica¬ 
tions, he digested the contemporary art of Brancusi, Arp, Miro, 
and Picasso. He was also influenced by the periods intense 
interest in non-Western art, including the Pre-Columbian art 
of Mexico. 

By the early 1930s, Moore s mature style had emerged, repre¬ 
sented here by Recumbent Figure (fig. 28.21), made in 1938. The 
work is reminiscent of a Classical reclining river-goddess, 
although it is based more directly on Pre-Columbian figures. The 
sculptor is more interested in projecting the elemental and univer¬ 
sal than in Classical antiquity as he explores the associations 
between the forms of nature and the shape of the figure. We see a 
woman, but the stone retains its identity as stone, looking like a 
rock that has been eroded by the elements for millions of years. 
Moore ingeniously suggests that figure and rock are one and the 
same, even making the female form harmonize with the striations 
of the stone. The universal forces present in the rock are trans¬ 
ferred to the figure, which becomes an earth-goddess or fertility 
figure. The undulation of her abstract body virtually transforms 


her into a landscape. Adding to the mystical aura is Moore s bril¬ 
liant interplay between solid and void, each having the same 
weight in the composition and evoking the womblike mystery of 
caves or tidal pools embedded in seashore rocks. 

Moore felt comfortable showing works similar to Recumbent 
Figure at the International Surrealist Exhibition held in London in 
1936; he may have seen an affinity with the Surrealists in his 
attempts to express a higher reality lying beneath the surface of 
things. But Moore felt equally comfortable exhibiting in shows of 
abstract art, and his sculpture poses a classic case of the problem¬ 
atic nature of labeling art. 

Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) identified entirely with 
abstraction, and was a member of Abstraction-Creation. She trav¬ 
eled to Paris in 1933 and visited the studios of Arp and Brancusi; 
she also met Picasso. She was in Paris again in 1935 and met 
Mondrian. Like Moore, who was with her for a time at the Leeds 
School of Art and was a lifelong friend, she was interested in 
investing her abstract forms with a sense of the unseen forces of 
nature. She began working in abstraction in the early 1930s, and 
within a few years her sculpture became geometric. Instead of 
seeming hard-edged and mechanical, however, they are organic 
and mysterious, a quality that became even stronger after she 
moved to a cottage overlooking St. Ives Bay in Cornwall on the 
southwest tip of England when war broke out in 1939. Her sculp¬ 
ture was a personal response to nature. (See Primary Source , page

1002 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



Barbara Hepworth 
(1903-1975) 

“On Sculpture” (1937) 

In a 1937 book of artists 3 statements , British abstract sculptor Barbara 
Hepworth made the following statement about how her work reflects 
universal truths and an individual's relationship to nature. 

T he whole life force is in the vision which includes all phantasy, all 
intuitive imagination, and all conscious selection from experi¬ 
ence. Ideas are born through a perfect balance of our conscious and 
unconscious life and they are realized through this same fusion and 
equilibrium. The choice of one idea from several, and the capacity to 
relate the whole of our past experience to the present idea is our 
conscious mind: our sensitivity to the unfolding of the idea in 
substance, in relation to the very act of breathing, is our unconscious 
intuition. ... 


Contemporary constructive work does not lose by not having par¬ 
ticular human interest, drama, fear or religious emotion. It moves us 
profoundly because it represents the whole of the artist’s experience 
and vision, his whole sensibility to enduring ideas, his whole desire 
for a realization of these ideas in life and a complete rejection of the 
transitory and local forces of destruction. It is an absolute belief in 
man, in landscape and in the universal relationship of constructive 
ideas. The abstract forms of his work are now unconscious and intu¬ 
itive—his individual manner of expression. His conscious life is bent 
on discovering a solution to human difficulties by solving his own 
thought permanently, and in relation to his medium. ... [Abstraction] 
is no escapism, no ivory tower, no isolated pleasure in proportion and 
space—it is an unconscious manner of expressing our belief in a 
possible life. The language of colour and form is universal and not 
one for a special class (though this may have been in the past)—it is a 
thought which gives the same life, the same expansion, the same 
universal freedom to everyone.

The carved wood is finely polished and covered with an immacu¬ 
late sheen of white paint, producing a surface that, like the shape 
of the work, evokes purity. In addition, the white of the shell 
heightens the mystery of the dark cavity, which harbors a sky or 
water of deep blue. The stretched red strings have the intensity of 
the suns rays and perpetual energy of life forces. Hepworth her¬ 
self said, “the strings were the tension I felt between myself and 
the sea, the wind or the hills. ” 


CREATING UTOPIAS 

While Dada and Surrealism constituted a major force for the 
period between the wars, they were not the only movements. 
Many twentieth-century artists remained committed to exploring 
abstract art. Surrealists and abstract artists often shared similar 
social goals: Both groups championed individual freedom, and 
both wished to undermine bourgeois values, to eradicate nation¬ 
alism, to destroy capitalism, and to create a classless society. (See 
,) Many Dadaists and Surrealists were social¬ 
ists who also participated in Communist Party activities. 
Similarly, many abstract artists were socialists and Communists, 
but they viewed abstract art itself as a vehicle for creating a 
utopian society. 

Two major centers of geometric abstraction emerged simulta¬ 
neously: Constructivism appeared with the Russian Revolution in 
1917, and De Stijl (The Style) appeared in Amsterdam. A third 
center was the Bauhaus in Germany, an art school founded in 
1919 that succeeded as a significant force in the following decade 
and was often influenced by Constructivist refugees from Russia 
and De Stijl artists. Constructivism and the Bauhaus were espe¬ 
cially influenced by the period s belief that industry and machines 
would create a better world, and the inter-war era, which indeed 
was dominated by tremendous technological advances, is often 
referred to as “The Machine Age. ” 


Russian Constructivism: 

Productivism and Utilitarianism 

The most direct connection between abstract art and radical poli¬ 
tics came in the revolutionary society that developed in Russia. 
There, before and after the October Revolution of 1917, artists 
committed themselves to developing new art forms that they

hoped would bring about a new utopian society. Building on the 
innovations of Malevich’s Suprematism (see page 966), several 
movements followed, each attempting to put art at the service of 
the new revolutionary society. 

VLADIMIR TATLIN As Malevich was developing his Suprem¬ 
atist painting in Moscow, a fellow Russian, Vladimir Tatlin 
(1885-1953), was working in Berlin and Paris. In 1914, Tatlin vis¬ 
ited Picasso’s Paris studio and saw his constructions (see page 
954). Upon returning to Russia, he then made his own con¬ 
structed reliefs (fig. 28.23), which he called “counterreliefs,” for 
which he used cardboard, wood, and metal covered with a variety 
of materials, including glazes, glass, and plaster. Similar to Russian 
icons and Malevich’s Black Square (see fig. 27.23), some of the 
counterreliefs spanned corners, in effect using the space of the 
room to create a small environment. Unlike Picasso’s construc¬ 
tions, which were generally musical instruments, Tatlin’s were 
nonobjective, that is, they were totally abstract like Malevich’s 
paintings, and not meant to evoke real objects. Following Tatlin’s 
lead, other Russian sculptors began making abstract sculpture 
from geometric forms, a movement that in 1922 was formally 
called Constructivism. 

With the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Tatlin’s attitude 
toward his art changed. He embraced Communism and focused 
his efforts on supporting the party’s goal of creating a utopian 
society. He worked for the Soviet Education Commissariat and 
turned his attention to architecture and engineering. A major 
component of his teachings was his passionate belief in the utility 
of modern machinery, the democratic quality of mass-produced 
objects, and the efficiency of industrial materials. Technological 
modernity was the future and the new religion, and industrial effi¬ 
ciency and materials had to be incorporated into art, design, and 
architecture, where they would produce a new, better, classless 
world. In other words, the social revolution had to be comple¬ 
mented with an aesthetic revolution. According to Tatlin’s theory

of Constructivist Productivism, everything—from appliances to 
clothing, from living spaces to theaters—now had to be machine- 
like and streamlined. Form must follow function and objects were 
to be stripped of all ornamentation, which was associated with 
bourgeois values and aristocratic ostentation. 

Tatlin’s most famous work is his Project for “Monument to the 
Third International ” (fig. 28.24), begun in 1919 and exhibited in 
Petrograd (St. Petersburg) and Moscow in December 1920. The 
project was actually a model for a building—which was never 
built—that was supposed to be 1,300 feet high, which would have 
made it the tallest structure in the world at that time. It was to 
have a metal spiral frame tilted at an angle and encompassing a 
glass cube, cylinder, and cone. These steel and glass units, housing 
conference and meeting rooms, were to revolve, making a com¬ 
plete revolution once a year, month, and day, respectively. The 
industrial materials of steel and glass and the dynamic, kinetic 
nature of the work symbolized the new Machine Age and the 
dynamism of the Bolshevik Revolution. The tower was to func¬ 
tion as a propaganda center for the Communist Third

International, an organization devoted to world revolution, and 
its rotating, ascending spiral symbolized the aspirations of 
Communism. 

Following Tatlins dictum of “Art into Life,” many artists, at 
least temporarily if not completely, gave up making conventional 
art in order to design functional objects that would help create the 
great classless utopia. Both Aleksandr Rodchenko (1891-1956) 
and his wife Varvara Fedorovna Stepanova (1894-1958) fall into 
this category. In the early 1920s, Rodchenko stopped making 
Suprematist paintings and Constructivist assemblages to focus on 
graphic design, as seen here in a poster promoting literacy (fig. 
28.25). We are far removed from the organic and human Art 
Nouveau posters of Toulouse-Lautrec (see fig. 26.8), for example. 
Instead, a bold mechanical geometry prevails, with a nearly space¬ 
less image pressed to the surface. Even the letters are austere and 
geometric. Bold color creates an energy that is reinforced by the 
design, where the word “Books,” for example, is shaped like a 
megaphone that emits the phrase “In All Spheres of Knowledge. ” 
At the time, Stepanova was the designer for a Moscow textile fac¬ 
tory In the sportswear reproduced here (fig. 28.26), we again see 
bright colors and a simple yet energetic machinelike geometry. 
There is no ornamentation or reference to the past, nothing that 
could be associated with any class, time period, ethnic type, or 
region. Confronted with the problem of creating a new society, 
the Constructivist designers invented a new graphic language, one 
that was distinctly modern, utilitarian, and classless. 


De Stijl and Universal Order 

In 1917 in Amsterdam, Piet Mondrian (1872-1944), with painter 
Theo van Doesburg (1883-1931) and several other artists and 
architects, founded a movement called De Stijl (The Style). 
Architect Gerrit Rietveld (1888-1964) joined the group in 1919. 
Though not backed by a revolutionary government, as were the

Russian artists, their goal was every bit as radical and utopian, 
for De Stijl artists sought to create, through geometric abstrac¬ 
tion, total environments that were so perfect they embodied a 
universal harmony. Unlike their Russian counterparts, their 
mission was literally spiritual. Driven by Mondrian and Van 
Doesburg s intense commitment to Theosophy, De Stijl artists, as 
did the Communists, sought a universal order that would make 
nationalism obsolete. They called their style the International 
Style, applying it most often to a new architecture of glass and 
steel that was modern, pure, and universal, with no national 
identification. 

PIET MONDRIAN In the magazine De Stijl , the group s publi¬ 
cation, the artist Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) presented his theory 
of art in a series of articles. (See Primary Source , page 1007.) His 
philosophy was based on Theosophy (see page 946), which he was

interested in before his move to Paris in 1911. After returning to 
neutral Amsterdam during the Great War, he was further influ¬ 
enced by the ideas of mystical lay philosopher and close acquain¬ 
tance M. H. J. Schoenmaekers and especially Schoenmaekers s 
book New Image of the World , the only book other than his own 
publications in his library. Schoenmaekers argued that there was 
an underlying mathematical structure to the universe that consti¬ 
tuted true reality. He believed that an artist could access and pres¬ 
ent this structure through rational manipulations of geometric 
forms. Mondrian developed an art based on such geometry and, 
using Schoenmaekers s term, he called it Neo-Plasticism, meaning 
“New Plasticism. ” By “plastic” in painting, he meant that the 
world of the painting had a plastic, or three-dimensional, reality 
of its own that corresponded to the harmonious plastic reality of 
the universe. In other words, he sought to replicate in his art the 
unseen underlying structure of the cosmos. 

Beginning in 1917, Mondrian struggled to achieve this using 
total geometric abstraction, and only succeeded in his efforts 
upon returning to Paris in late 1919. After establishing his 
style, he pretty much retained it for the rest of his life, as seen 
in Composition en Rouge , Bleu et Jaune (fig. 28.27) of 1930. His 
paintings, which are always asymmetrical, are remarkable for 
their perfect harmony Mondrian very precisely gives every ele¬ 
ment in his painting equal weight. Each line and rectangle in this 


square canvas is assigned its own identity Every line exists in its 
own right, not as a means of defining the color rectangles. (The 
thickness of the lines often varies in his paintings, a function of 
individual identity) Each component in the painting sits on the 
same plane on the surface—there is no foreground or back¬ 
ground, no one object sitting on top of another. Despite this 
perfectly interlocking surface, the painting has a feeling of 
tremendous space, even of infinity, largely due to the rectangles 
expanding off the edges of the canvas. Space and mass have 
merged into a harmonious whole in what Mondrian called 
“dynamic equilibrium,” where everything is energized yet bal¬ 
anced. Mondrian has attempted to capture the complexity of 
the universe—the individuality of its infinite components and the 
harmony and spiritual sameness that holds everything together. 

Mondrian did endless variations of these motifs. Even the 
color did not change, since these elementary hues, from which all 
colors are derived, are symbolic of the building blocks of the cos¬ 
mos. But in principle, painting was not the end product of 
Mondrian s aesthetic program. He considered it just a stop-gap 
measure until perfect abstract environments of architecture, fur¬ 
niture, and objects embodying all of these same principles could 
be achieved. Until then, the world needed his painting. 

GERRIT RIETVELD Mondrians De Stijl colleagues sought to 
implement his theories in architecture and interior design. In 
1917, Gerrit Rietveld (1888-1964), a furniture maker who became 
a self-taught architect, designed the “Red-Blue” chair (fig. 28.28), 
representing the first attempt to apply Neo-Plasticism to the

1006 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 












Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) 

From “Natural Reality and Abstract Reality” 
(1919) 

This is an excerpt from an essay originally published in the magazine 
De Stijl in 1919. Here Mondrian explains how Neo-Plastic painting , 
using an abstract vocabulary ; captures universal harmony. 

T he cultivated man of today is gradually turning away from 
natural things, and his life is becoming more and more abstract. 
Natural (external) things become more and more automatic, 
and we observe that our vital attention fastens more and more on 
internal things. The life of the truly modern man is neither purely 
materialistic nor purely emotional. It manifests itself rather as a more 
autonomous life of the human mind becoming conscious of itself. 

Natural man—although a unity of body, mind and soul—exhibits 
a changed consciousness: every expression of his life has today a 
different aspect, that is, an aspect more positively abstract. 

It is the same with art. Art will become the product of another 
duality in man: the product of a cultivated externality and of an 
inwardness deepened and more conscious. As a pure representation 
of the human mind, art will express itself in an aesthetically purified, 
that is to say, abstract form. 


The truly modern artist is aware of abstraction in an emotion of 
beauty; he is conscious of the fact that the emotion of beauty is 
cosmic, universal. This conscious recognition has for its corollary an 
abstract plasticism, for man adheres only to what is universal. 

The new plastic idea cannot, therefore, take the form of a natural or 
concrete representation, although the latter does always indicate the 
universal to a degree, or at least conceals it within. This new plastic 
idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural 
form and color. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the 
abstraction of form and color, that is to say, in the straight line and the 
clearly defined primary color. ... 

We find that in nature all relations are dominated by a single pri- 
moridal relation, which is defined by the opposition of two extremes. 
Abstract plasticism represents this primordial relation in a precise 
manner by means of the two positions which form the right angle. 
This positional relation is the most balanced of all, since it expresses 
in a perfect harmony the relation between two extremes, and contains 
all other relations. 

If we conceive these two extremes as manifestations of interiority 
and exteriority, we will find that in the new plasticism the tie uniting 
mind and life is not broken; thus, far from considering it a negation 
of truly living life we shall see a reconciliation of the matter-mind 
dualism.

decorative arts. One of the more uncomfortable chairs ever made, 
its emphasis was on spiritual aesthetics, employing flat planes and 
primary colors to implement Mondrian s dynamic equilibrium. 
Once the De Stijl members discovered and understood Frank 
Lloyd Wright (see page 934), whose works were published and 
available in Europe in 1911, they were able to apply architectural 
solutions to the theoretical ideas of Neo-Plasticism. They recog¬ 
nized that Wright had destroyed “the box,” and declared “the 
new architecture will be anticubic.” Combining the color and 
floating planes of Mondrian and the fluid spaces of Wright, 
Rietveld produced the definitive De Stijl building in 1924, the 
Schroder House in Utrecht (fig. 28.29), which was built onto the 
end of existing row houses. On the facade, we can find 
Mondrians “floating” rectangles and lines. Even the Wright-like 
cantilevered roof appears to float. The interior (see fig. 28.28) is 
designed according to the same principles, with wall-to-ceiling 
sliding panels allowing for a restructuring of the space. Both 
inside and out, the Schroder House is a three-dimensional 
Mondrian painting—ethereal, buoyant, and harmonious, 
embodying dynamic equilibrium. 


The Bauhaus: Credting the “New Man ” 

As we have seen, most Dadaists, Surrealists, and abstract artists 
were socialists or Communists who believed the Bolshevik 
Revolution in Russia would save the world from bourgeois mate¬ 
rialism and decadence and would establish a worldwide utopian 
society. Left-wing artists flocked to Berlin in 1922 to see the first

OUR 










Russian Art Exhibition, which presented the Constructivists for 
the first time in the West. Twice more that year, the avant-garde 
held conferences in Germany, attempting to commit to a social 
program that would put art at the service of restructuring society. 
All of these attempts came to naught. Instead, it was the Bauhaus, 
an art and design school, that gradually emerged as the strongest 
center for advocating social progress through art. 

The Bauhaus was founded in Weimar, Germany, in 1919 by 
the great Modernist architect Walter Gropius (see page 978). In 
many respects, the Bauhaus School was the embodiment of 
Muthesius s German Werkbund (see page 977), since the goal of 
the workshops was to design modern high-quality production- 
line products. Its guiding principle, however, was more utopian 
and less commercial, for the Bauhaus (meaning House of 
Building) was dedicated to the creation of utilitarian design for 
“the new man” through the marriage of art and technology. The 
school was formed by the merger of two Weimar arts and crafts 
schools, and designed to combine the fine and applied arts, giving 
each equal weight, as had the earlier Secessionist movements (see 
page 922). The artists were called artisan/craftspeople, and their 
mission was to create an abstract environment of the most pro¬ 
gressive modernity. Their design ethic was based on “the living 
environment of machines and vehicles.” Only “primary forms 
and colors” could be used, all in the service of creating “standard 
types for all practical commodities of everyday use as a social 
necessity. ” Like De Stijl, this was a philosophy oriented toward 
environments, not just painting and sculpture, and the Bauhaus is 


often more associated with the work that came out of the textile, 
metal, and ceramic workshops, such as Marcel Breuer s 1927 alu¬ 
minum tubular chairs and Anni Albers’s abstract textiles, than 
with the paintings of Klee, Kandinsky, and Josef Albers, who also 
taught at the school. 

MARCEL BREUER We can see the Bauhaus machine aesthetic at 
work in the living room of a Gropius house built in 1927 for a 
Werkbund housing development in Stuttgart (fig. 28.30). The fur¬ 
niture and lighting were designed by Marcel Breuer (1902-1981), 
a former Bauhaus student who became a faculty member in 1925, 
heading the furniture workshop. All of Breuer s objects are geo¬ 
metric, made of modern materials, and easily mass-produced. On 
the far right is perhaps his most famous product, the “Wassily” 
armchair, made of polished, nickel-plated tubular steel and cotton 
fabric. In its planarity, Breuer was clearly influenced by the 
Rietveld “Red-Blue” chair (which Van Doesburg had introduced 
to the Bauhaus in 1921 when he taught there and Breuer was a 
student). But now heavy wood has been replaced by a strong but 
light metal tube that is geometrically structured in an airy, open 
pattern. The feeling that results echoes the transparency and 
weightlessness of Suprematist painting and Constructivist sculp¬ 
ture, qualities that can even be seen in Tatlins Project for 
“Monument to the Third International ” (see fig. 28.24). Breuer 
described a practical side to his design when in the product cata¬ 
logue he wrote that the chair “provides a light, fully self-sprung 
sitting opportunity, which has the comfort of the upholstered

armchair, but with the difference that it is much lighter, handier, 
more hygienic. ” 

LASZLO MOHOLY-NAGY One of the strongest advocates of 
Constructivism at the Bauhaus, and perhaps the most influential 
figure there, was the Hungarian Laszlo Moholy-Nagy 
(1895-1946). Gropius hired Moholy-Nagy in 1923 as head of the 
metal workshop, but gradually he became the school s primary 
theoretician, concerned particularly with light and movement. As 
early as 1922, he began designing Constructivist sculptures that 
generated light, as seen in Light-Space Modulator (fig. 28.31). This 
machinelike construction of planes of plastic, steel, and wood was 
propelled in a circle by a motor and projected an ever-changing 
light spectacle onto its surroundings. It was used as a prop in a 
1930 ballet at the Bauhaus, but Moholy-Nagy also viewed it as a 
tool to study light and space, hoping to uncover new applications 
for environmental or stage lighting. 

WALTER GROPIUS Many art historians consider the crowning 
aesthetic achievement of the Bauhaus to be the building itself, 
designed by Gropius in 1925-26 when the school moved from 
Weimar to Dessau. The building consists of three L-shaped wings 
coming off a central hub: The Shop Block, a workshop wing, is 
shown in figure 28.32; a second wing had classrooms; and a third 
wing held an auditorium/theater, dining hall, and dormitory with 
studios. From the air, the complex looked like a Constructivist 
sculpture of rectangular blocks. The Bauhaus is dominated by a 
clearly articulated geometry. The workshop wing looks like an 
empty glass box, the glass curtain wall on two sides continuing 
around corners and flush with the stuccoed parapet above and

socle, or projecting molding underlying the wall, below. Instead 
of mass, we feel a weightless volume as defined by the metal and 
glass wall. And because the building projects over a setback half¬ 
basement, it seems to float. 

Perhaps more than anything designed by De Stijl, Gropius s 
Bauhaus came to epitomize High Modernist architecture—the 
architecture that evolved out of Early Modernism (see pages 
976-80) in the period between the two wars. With High 
Modernism, buildings became more severely geometric and so 
light they seemed to float. Their unadorned geometric shapes 
represented volume, not mass. Their walls, regardless of material, 
were thin membranes of a taut veneer that encased the building, 
and, as with the Bauhaus workshop, often this veneer was a cur¬ 
tain of glass, although horizontal strips of windows were gener¬ 
ally favored by High Modernist architects. But High Modernism 
was more than just a style; it was a social movement predicated 
on a utopian socialist philosophy and a rationalist belief in 
progress. Life could be improved, the theory went, by creating 
a Machine Age environment. Ultimately, the movement was 
reduced to a style in 1932 when Philip Johnson and historian 
Henry-Russell Hitchcock organized an exhibition entitled The 
International Style at the newly opened Museum of Modern 
Art in New York. Their concern was with the look of the archi¬ 
tecture, not its social premises. The exhibition brought the style 
to the attention of Americans, and resulted in the label 
“International Style,” coined by De Stijl, being used to describe 
High Modernist architecture. 

LUDWIG MIES VAN DER ROHE In 1930, architect Ludwig 
Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969) became the last director of the 
Bauhaus, which closed in 1933. In the 1920s, Mies had been at 
the center of the Berlin avant-garde. A student of Peter Behrens, 
he became a leading Modernist, and in 1927 organized the exper¬ 
imental Weissenhof Estate exhibition in Stuttgart, where leading 
architects were invited to build inexpensive but quality housing 


for workers. At this point he was converted to High Modernism, 
or the International Style, and was heavily influenced by the float¬ 
ing planes of De Stijl and the complex spaces of Wright. His 
motto, however, was “Less is more,” and his architecture is char¬ 
acterized by a severe geometry and simplicity. Nonetheless, his 
buildings never seem austere; they invariably have elegant pro¬ 
portions and a sense of refinement that makes them seem rich and 
lush. When budget allowed, he augmented this refinement by 
using luxurious materials, such as expensive marble and traver¬ 
tine, bronze, chrome, and tinted glass. 

We can see these qualities in his German Pavilion (fig. 28.33), 
designed for the 1929 Barcelona Exposition and dismantled after 
the fair closed. (A reconstruction exists in the same site today.) 
The pavilion itself was the German exhibit, and the building 
simply consists of spaces with no specific uses attached to 
them. There is nothing overtly innovative here; the overlapping 
horizontal and vertical planes, the interlocking open-form space, 
and canterlevering had been used previously in the work of 
Wright and the De Stijl architects. Miess innovation is subtle, 
and it resides in its simplicity of style. Geometry is everywhere. 
The pavilion sits on an enormous rectangular platform of beauti¬ 
ful travertine, and is partially enclosed by rectangular walls of 
travertine or Tinian marble. At either end, the platform is not 
covered and there is an asymmetrically placed but perfectly 
balanced rectangular pool lined with lush-looking black glass. 
The cantilevered flat roof is supported by a grid of eight slender 
piers, each a chrome x, between which are five partition walls, 
two in onyx, and the three others made of different kinds of 
glass—clear, frosted, and green—and encased in chrome mullions 
(fig. 28.34). Using a minimal vocabulary, Mies created a sump¬ 
tuous, elegant feast for the eye. Even the cantilevered chair he 
designed for the pavilion, known as the “Barcelona” chair 
and seen in figure 28.34, is simultaneously simple and posh, 
and, in contrast to the Rietveld “Red-Blue” chair, exceptionally 
comfortable.

The Machine Aesthetic in Paris 

The machine aesthetic and the utopian dream that accompanied it 
also made their way to Paris, where they found a rather different 
voice in the architecture of Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, called Le 
Corbusier (1886-1965). While developing his radical architectural 
theories, Le Corbusier also practiced as a painter, working under 
his given name Jeanneret. He created a style of painting that he 
called Purism, which reflected his belief in the supremacy of a 
machine aesthetic that embodied a Classical spirit. Purism influ¬ 
enced the French Cubist Fernand Leger, who was already well 
disposed toward glorifying the efficiency and purity of modern 
technology Unlike Moscow, Amsterdam, and Dessau, Paris had 
no art schools or major artistic movements pushing for a utopian 
vision. Instead, the cause there was undertaken by individuals. 

LE CORBUSIER’S IDEAL HOME Le Corbusier was Swiss, 
and led a rather peripatetic life prior to settling in Paris in the 
1910s. In 1907, in Lyon, France, he met architect Tony Gamier, 
who had developed an ideal industrial city, the Cite Industrielle, 
which influenced Le Corbusier to think in terms of socialist 
utopian architecture and the creation of an easily reproducible 
architectural type that would provide superior housing for every¬ 
one. The following year in Paris, he worked part time for Auguste 


Perret, the architect responsible for popularizing ferroconcrete— 
steel-reinforced concrete—as an architectural material. Most 
important, however, he demonstrated, as Max Berg had in his 
Breslau Jahrhunderthalle in 1912-13 (see fig. 27.39), the practical¬ 
ity of ferroconcrete: It is inexpensive, adaptable, easy to use, and 
very strong, combining the tensile strength of steel with the 
compressive resistance of concrete. (See Materials and Techniques , 
page 1013.) It is the medium Le Corbusier would adopt for most 
of his buildings. The last major influence on Le Corbusier was his 
experience in 1910 working in Peter Behrens s office in Berlin, 
where his colleagues included Walter Gropius and Mies van der 
Rohe. Here, he worked first hand with the German avant-garde 
architects who would be responsible for developing the 
International Style, and even then he was talking about creating a 
machine-based, easily reproduced architecture. 

In 1922, Le Corbusier opened an architectural firm with his 
cousin Pierre Jeanneret, and over the course of the next two 
decades, he designed a series of houses that allowed him to 
develop and implement his theories of the ideal house, one that 
could serve as a prototype for all homes. (See Primary Source , 
page 1012.) He called his first type, developed in 1914, the Dom¬ 
ino, because the house consisted of concrete floors with ceilings 
that sat on concrete columns arranged in a grid pattern that 
resembled the dots on a domino. By 1923, he had developed the

Le Corbusier (1886-1965) 



From Towards a New Architecture (1923) 

First published in 1923 , Towards a New Architecture codified ideas that 
were being widely discussed among architects , and it became the first 
manifesto of the International Style. The following excerpts are from 
the opening argument. 



T he Architect, by his arrangement of forms, realizes an order 
which is a pure creation of his spirit; by forms and shapes he 
affects our senses to an acute degree and provokes plastic emotions; 
by the relationships which he creates he wakes profound echoes in us, 
he gives us the measure of an order which we feel to be in accordance 
with that of our world, he determines the various movements of our 
heart and of our understanding; it is then that we experience the sense 
of beauty

principles for his ideal home, which he published in an article 
entitled "Five Points of a New Architecture.” His five points 
were the following: (1) no ground floor, with the house raised on 
columns called pilotis; (2) a flat roof, which would be used as a 
garden terrace; (3) an open floor plan, with partitions slotted 
between supports; (4) free composition of the exterior curtain 
walls; and (5) preferably ribbon (horizontal) windows. The raised 
house allowed for privacy and light and made the outdoors 
accessible by putting a garden on the roof. Much later, Le Cor¬ 
busier remarked that "a house is a machine for living in,” which 
suggested—wrongly—to many critics that he advocated a brutal 
functionalism that was not concerned with beauty and comfort. 
In fact, Le Corbusier wanted to create a Classical purity based on 


geometry and a machine-age look. "Architecture is the masterly, 
correct, and magnificent play of masses brought together in 
light,” he wrote. "Cubes, cones, cylinders, and pyramids are the 
primary forms which light reveals to advantage.” Within this 
aesthetic, however, his emphasis was on the human being and 
"living. ” Machine Age values and technology were meant to serve 
humans, and consequently his houses, using the latest technology, 
would have a Machine Age look and efficiency. And they would 
be filled with light. 

The 1928-29 Villa Savoye (fig. 28.35) in Poissy-sur-Seine, 
outside Paris, is Le Corbusier s best-known house, and here we can 
see most of the elements called for in his "Five Points”: the pilotis, 
the raised living space, the ribbon windows, and the flat-roof

Reinforced Concrete 


R einforced concrete became one of the most popular building mater¬ 
ials in the twentieth century. Concrete is a cement mixture of sand, 
limestone, and water that contains small stones or other (generally 
solid) small objects. While its history dates to 5600 bce in the Balkans, 
the Romans were the first to use it extensively, starting in the second 
century bce (see pages 1 86-87). Romans builders used concrete for 
bridges, docks, pavements, and aqueducts, but it was also used for 
homes and major civic buildings, such as the Pantheon (see fig. 7.23). 

Concrete virtually disappeared from architecture after the Fall of 
Rome. Its revival began in 1 824, when an English mason, Joseph 
Aspdin, patented an improved cement. Because it resembled a natural 
stone found on the Isle of Portland, the new material was called 
Portland cement. To make it, Aspdin heated clay and limestone to 
especially high temperatures, a process still used today. While con¬ 
crete is fire-resistant and can stand extremely high compression, or 


evenly applied weight, it does not have much tensile strength. That is, 
it does not hold up under unevenly applied stresses. To solve the prob¬ 
lem, engineers reinforced the concrete by embedding iron rods within 
it. Steel rods replaced iron rods in the late nineteenth century. (A form 
of steel first appeared in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
although modern steel was not invented until toward the end of the 
century.) Iron and concrete were a perfect match, since the materials 
complemented each other. Concrete protected the iron, which other¬ 
wise melted and corroded easily, while iron provided the tensile 
strength that concrete lacked. 

Almost simultaneously in England and France, inventors began to 
patent ferroconcrete, as steel-reinforced concrete is called. A British 
plasterer patented concrete floors and roofs made with iron bars 
and wire rope, while a French gardener took out a patent on steel- 
reinforced concrete planters, eventually designing guardrails, posts, 
and beams as well. But it was not until the 1 890s that the French 


Francois Hennebique. System for reinforced concrete. 

1892 (After Curtis) 

engineer Francois Flennebique designed a ferroconcrete post-and-slab 
construction where each floor/ceiling was an integral part of the struc¬ 
ture, not a separate element lying on top of a supporting frame (see 

fig.). Flennebrique’s engineering was 
applied largely to industrial buildings 
and simply imitated traditional post-and- 
lintel styles. 

Credit for introducing ferroconcrete to 
“high” architecture generally goes to the 
French architect Auguste Perret, who 
designed apartment buildings and park¬ 
ing garages using steel-reinforced con¬ 
crete in the opening decades of the 
twentieth century. One of his most 
famous buildings is the Rainey Church, 
outside Paris, built in 1 922 (see fig.), 
which conceptually uses the Rationalism 
we saw in Soufflot’s Saint-Genevieve (see 
fig. 23.1 9) while aspiring to implement 
the lightness and airiness of a Gothic 
cathedral. Max Berg’s Jahrhunderthalle 
(see fig. 27.39) in Breslau, built in 
1912-13, also played a major role in 
popularizing ferroconcrete. Ultimately, it 
became the principal medium for Le Corbusier and a favorite for Frank 
Lloyd Wright (see page 934). 

In addition to its strength, ferroconcrete is attractive because it is 
inexpensive. The concrete component is readily available. The steel, 
the most expensive and rare component, makes up only 1 to 6 percent 
of the structure. By 1 904, ferroconcrete was being used in skyscrap¬ 
ers; the first use was in the Ingalls Building in Cincinnati, which was 1 6 
stories and rose to 21 0 feet. By 1 962, it was being used in modern 
high-rises, including the 60-story twin towers of Marina City in 
Chicago. From 1 998 to 2003, the largest building in the world was the 
ferroconcrete Petronas Towers in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, designed 
by Cesar Pelli, who is based in Hartford, Connecticut. Rising 88 
stories and 1,483 feet, the building would have been prohibitively 
expensive without ferroconcrete, since Malaysia does not manufacture 
steel. Like much of the world, however, Malaysia readily produces 
high-quality concrete.

terrace, which is protected behind the enormous cylindrical wind¬ 
screens that look like oceanliner smokestacks. The main floor, the 
second, has an open-space plan using partition walls, and it faces 
into a court (fig. 28.36), from which a ramp leads up to the roof. 
Everywhere we look we see a beautiful classicizing geometry, the 
building blocks of Le Corbusier s design aesthetic. The building is 
a perfect square box precisely defined by its taut skin of concrete. 
The pilotis are cylinders, and the windbreakers are enormous 
arcs. Obscured by the shadow in figure 28.35 is another geomet¬ 
ric curve on the ground floor, which encloses the garage and 
servants’ quarters. Like the Bauhaus and the Schroder House, the 
villa appears light, virtually floating on its pilotis. 

But as abstract and futuristic as the house may seem, it 
resonates with the past. We can project onto it the classic, white 
stuccoed Mediterranean house, oriented around a central court, 
that sits on a hill overlooking the sea. Le Corbusier also described 
his villa as a jardin suspendu , a hanging garden reflecting the 
mythical gardens of Babylon. The building also recalls Palladio in 
the perfection of the square, while the colonnade of pilotis echoes 
a Doric temple. The ramps (there is a circular staircase as well) 
linking the floors have reminded scholars of the great entrance 
ramps of Mycenae. In one of the great statements of High 
Modernism, Le Corbusier presents the Modernist, Machine Age 
update of the great Greek temple perched on a hill, overlooking 
nature, and permeated with light and air. 

PURISM AND FERNAND LEGER In 1917, Le Corbusier 
met the painter Amedee Ozenfant (1886-1966), and together 
they developed a theory called Purism, which in essence was a 


Neo-Platonic concept that reduced all artistic expression to an 
abstract Classical purity reflecting a machine aesthetic. Clean 
line, pure forms, and mathematical clarity were highly valued. In 
1918, they published an essay entitled “After Cubism” that railed 
against the distortions of the Cubist style, and in 1920 they 
published another essay, “Purism,” which gave a label to their 
theory. As stated before, Le Corbusier was a painter as well. 
Working and writing under his given name Charles-Edouard 
Jeanneret, and like his colleague, Ozenfant, he made mostly still 
lifes, which used the multiple perspectives of Cubism but reduced 
objects to geometric mechanomorphic forms that run parallel to 
the picture plane. 

The Cubist Fernand Leger (1881-1955) became an adherent of 
Purism, although he never defined himself as such. He was cer¬ 
tainly predisposed to its ideas, for in the early 1910s, he had made 
abstract, mechanical-looking Cubist figures, and was an outspo¬ 
ken socialist and champion of modernity and technological 
advancement. In the early 1920s, however, his style reflected the 
machinelike geometry and Classicism advocated by Jeanneret and 
Ozenfant, as can be seen in Three Women (Le Grand Dejeuner ) 
(fig. 28.37) of 1921. His almost identical-looking nudes are con¬ 
structed of circles and cylinders. Their body parts, such as hair 
and faces, are so similar they could be interchangeable. Virtually 
all of the objects look machine-made, and, as with the figures, 
they are reduced to cubes, cones, cylinders, and pyramids. 
Organic and man-made elements are virtually indistinguishable, 
and both types are ordered in a tight grid of horizontal and verti¬ 
cals and run parallel to the picture plane. Color is also kept to 
essentials—the primary and binaries—the building blocks of the

color spectrum. Leger has taken the Classical theme of the mon¬ 
umental nude (although here we seem to be in a brothel) and 
updated it by placing it in a contemporary world of technological 
harmony and perfection, in effect telling us, as Seurat had 30 years 
earlier (see page 908), that the new Classicism and world order are 
based on the machine and science. 

ART IN AMERICA: MODERNITY, 
SPIRITUALITY, AND REGIONALISM 

Perhaps more than Europe, the United States could embrace the 
machine as the emblem of progress, for after World War I, 
America was the undisputed technological world leader. In con¬ 
trast to the European avant-garde that sought a classless, nation¬ 
less world, Americans were preoccupied with national identity. 
And generally they did not have a utopian vision. Instead they 
viewed skyscrapers, factories, and machines as symbols of the 
nations technological superiority. But not everyone embraced 
modernity. As the economy boomed in the postwar years, 
culminating in the dizzying exuberance of the Roaring Twenties, 
many artists rejected materialism and looked to the spiritual. 
While some artists turned to nature in search of universal truths, 
others sought strength in old-fashioned American values that 
could be found in the American heartland, especially in the 
mythic conservative lifestyle of its hearty, hard-working, God¬ 
fearing farmers. 

Still others responded to the poverty and social discontent that 
coexisted with the boom years. The period was marked by the 
oppression of labor, violent labor strikes, and anarchist threats. 
Racism escalated in the South, led by the dramatic growth of 
the Ku Klux Klan and increased lynchings of black men. The 


Twentieth Amendment granted women the right to vote in 1920, 
but it had no impact on granting social and economic parity, as 
women continued to be restricted to “womens jobs” and less pay. 
The Great Depression exacerbated these injustices, resulting in 
the rise in the 1930s of a representational art called Social Realism. 

The City and Industry 

Arriving in New York harbor for the first time in 1915, Marcel 
Duchamp marveled at the towering skyscrapers and pronounced 
them the epitome of modernity. Fie saw in America the future of 
art. The skyscraper and modern industry did indeed become the 
emblems of America, replacing landscape, which had dominated 
painting in the previous century. Skyscrapers were symbols of 
modernity, industry, and commerce, and thus of the country’s 
technological and financial superiority, for the United States 
entered the century as the wealthiest and most modern country in 
the world. World War I fueled the economy, ushering in an era of 
unprecedented consumerism and materialism. Known as the 
Roaring Twenties and the Jazz Age, the 1920s were dominated by 
the culture of the city, for by 1920 more people lived in cities than 
in the countryside. 

The symbol of the nation was New York, dominated by sky¬ 
scrapers. Beginning in the late 1910s, these “cathedrals of capital¬ 
ism” or of “commerce” became the favorite subject for painters 
and photographers—and for sculptors and designers—who pre¬ 
sented the icon in all its technological splendor. Skyscrapers were 
shown soaring toward the heavens without a hint of the streets or 
humanity below Bridges, factories, dams, refineries—anything 
that demonstrated Americas advanced modernity—were also 
transformed into monuments as grand as the pyramids of Egypt 
and as sacred as the Gothic cathedrals of France. 


CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 1015 







JOSEPH STELLA Perhaps the greatest single visual icon of the 
city was made by the Italian immigrant Joseph Stella (1877-1946). 
Entitled The Voice of the City (New York Interpreted) (fig. 28.38) 
and completed in 1922, it is an 8-foot-high, five-panel work that 
features on its center panel an abstraction of the city’s towers, 
with the famous Flatiron building in the foreground, surrounded 
by both actual and fictitious buildings. The panels flanking the 
center panel represent the “Great White Way,” Broadway, which 
has been reduced to an abstraction of color and light. The far-left 
panel presents the harbor on the Hudson River on the west side of 
lower Manhattan, while the right panel shows the Brooklyn Bridge 
on the east side. Every image features the technological wonders 
of Manhattan. We see communication towers, air-venting systems, 
and elevated trains in the harbor picture. The Great White Way 
panels present the dazzling illumination of Times Square at night, 
which at the time had no equivalent anywhere else in the world. 
In effect, these two panels are a homage to electricity and the 
energy of the city. And even 35 years after opening, the Brooklyn 
Bridge still remained one of the world s great feats of engineering. 

Stella came to America in 1896, thus witnessing the rise of 
modern New York City at the turn of the century. He temporar¬ 
ily returned to Italy to study in 1910, where he met the Futurists 
(see pages 964-66). Through the Stieglitz gallery and his friend¬ 
ship with Duchamp and Man Ray, among others, he kept in touch 


with European trends, with Cubism becoming his primary artis¬ 
tic language in the 1910s. The Great White Way panels especially 
reflect the tenets of Futurism, for here we see the sound waves 
and Mach-like indications of motion that we saw in Boccioni s 
States of Mind I (see fig. 27.20). Their dizzying kaleidoscope of 
color powerfully captures the intense visual experience of Times 
Square at night. But in the skyscraper and Brooklyn Bridge pan¬ 
els, Stella is not only representational, he is iconic, centering his 
motifs and transforming them into emblems of modernity. His 
palette is deeply saturated, and color is often encased in heavy 
black-line drawing, in effect transforming his image into a 
medieval stained-glass window. He reinforces the religious motif 
by adding a predella at the bottom (see page 525), which itemizes 
the different tunnels and utility tubes running beneath the city. In 
effect, Stella is declaring technology and modernity the religion of 
the twentieth century. 

PAUL STRAND Photography, it turns out, was especially well 
suited for capturing the triumphs of the Machine Age. However, 
the first photographs of modern New York, such as Alfred 
Stieglitz s The City of Ambition (see fig. 26.45), romanticized 
the metropolis by immersing it in a soft pictorial haze. A 
breakthrough occurred when a young New Yorker, Paul Strand 
(1890-1976), from 1915 to 1917 made a large body of work of

sharply focused, high-contrast photographs. Stieglitz immediately 
recognized their importance and showed a selection of them at 
“291.” Wire Wheel (fig. 28.39) is from this period. Its abstracted 
subject is a Model T Ford, an icon of the Machine Age since it 
marked the advent of the assembly line. The picture rejects the 
“painterliness” of turn-of-the-century pictorial photography. In 
its place is a new compositional style based on the Cubism that 
Strand saw displayed at Stieglitz s “291.” By taking a close-up of 
the car, Strand created a skewed perspective and tight cropping, 
resulting in a difficult-to-read image with a flattened and compli¬ 
cated space. 

In 1920, Strand collaborated with painter/photographer 
Charles Sheeler (1883-1965) to make a film intended to capture 
the energy and grandeur of New York. Entitled Manhatta (New 
York the Magnificent) (see www.myartslab.com ), it opens with 
commuters arriving by ferry in lower Manhattan, spilling off the 
boat in teeming masses, and swarming through the financial 
district on their way to work. At the end of the film, the crowds 
get back on the boat at sunset. Rapid editing, vertiginous shots

taken from the top of skyscrapers (fig. 28.40), raking angles, and 
sharp value contrasts—all simulating a Cubist fracturing—are 
among the formalist devices that give this movie a sense of surg¬ 
ing energy and constant movement designed to capture the rapid 
pace of modernity and the powerful current of the urban experi¬ 
ence. Interspersed throughout the film are fragments of Walt 
Whitmans 1860/1881 poem Mannahatta which proclaims the 
greatness, energy, and might of New York. 

MARGARET BOURKE-WHITE Strand s hard-edged aesthetic 
transformed photography, not only in America, but eventually 
throughout the world. His style was especially appropriate for 
technological and industrial images, reinforcing the machine- 
made precision of the subject. Photojournalist Margaret Bourke- 
White especially embraced this new aesthetic and was drawn to 
technological imagery especially machines, airplanes, and dirigi¬ 
bles. In Fort Peck Dam , Montana (fig. 28.41), she presents a sym¬ 
bol of American technology The picture was the cover image for 
the very first issue of Life , published on November 23,1936. The 
photograph s power lies in its severe austerity which reinforces 
the mammoth scale of the dam, dwarfing the antlike workers 
below. Each of the dam s pylons is identical, looking as though 
they were pressed out of an enormous machine mold, and because 
the photograph of the dam is cropped on either side, these gigan¬ 
tic assembly-line towers seem endless as well. Owing to their 
severe monumentality, they take on the grandeur of ancient 
Assyrian or Egyptian monuments. Again we find an artist declar¬ 
ing modern technology to be the new Classicism. 

CHARLES DEMUTH In his 1927 painting My Egypt (fig. 28.42), 
depicting contemporary grain elevators near his native Lancaster, 
Pennsylvania, Charles Demuth (1883-1935) similarly transformed 
American modernity into a Classical icon. Demuth had studied in 
Paris from 1912 to 1914, absorbing European Modernism, and by 
the 1920s he was traveling in the most sophisticated artistic circles 
and showing with Alfred Stieglitz. His work is quite varied in 
style, even in a given period, and here we see him working in the 
American counterpart of Purism, a style called Precisionism. In 
the 1920s, a group of American artists, including Demuth, devel¬ 
oped a look that had the hard-edged geometric quality of Cubism 
but was far more representational. It came to be called 
Precisionism not only because of its precise geometry and draw¬ 
ing, but also because it seemed to capture the precision of mecha¬ 
nization and industry which was often its subject matter. 
Brushwork was meticulous, and at one point these artists, who 
rarely showed together and did not think of themselves as a 
group, were called Immaculates. 

At first glance, My Egypt seems quite Cubist. But the physical 
integrity of the grain elevators is barely compromised, and what 
seems like Cubist fracturing are mysterious, almost mystical, 
beams of light that only slightly distort the objects but quite suc¬ 
cessfully invest the building with a brute power, if not a mystical 
transcendence. The title suggests that such agricultural architec¬ 
ture as grain elevators were America s pyramids. The smokestack

endows the grain elevators with an industrial might, and the 
geometry of the ventilation ducts and massive cylinders of the 
storage tanks virtually transform the building itself into an 
efficient machine. 

STUART DAVIS Among the American artists who captured the 
essence of the modern experience using abstraction was Stuart 
Davis (1892-1964). The 1913 Armory Show in New York (see 
page 974) converted Davis into a dedicated Modernist, and by the 
1920s his work was becoming increasingly abstract. Just as 
Mondrian tried to find an abstract equivalent for invisible life 
forces, Davis wanted to create the plastic equivalent for experi¬ 
encing modern life—flying in an airplane, looking down from a 
towering skyscraper, listening to jazz music, or riding in a speed¬ 
ing car, motorcycle, or train. He wanted to capture the experience 


of the “new lights, speeds, and spaces which are uniquely real in 
our time. ” To do this, he used a Synthetic Cubist vocabulary, and 
by the 1930s his palette had become bright, limited to primary, 
secondary, and tertiary colors, and his forms quite jaunty and 
their juxtaposition raucous, as seen in Hot Still-Scape for Six 
Colors—Seventh Avenue Style (fig. 28.43) of 1940. After describ¬ 
ing how his colors were used like musical instruments to create a 
composition (Davis loved jazz and swing), he went on to describe 
his picture, painted in his Seventh Avenue studio: “The subject 
matter...is well within the experience of any modern city dweller. 
Fruit and flowers; kitchen utensils; fall skies; horizons; taxi cabs; 
radio; art exhibitions and reproductions; fast travel; Americana; 
movies; electric signs; dynamics of city sights and sounds; these 
and a thousand more are common experience and they are the 
basic subject matter which my picture celebrates.” Embedded

within this playful jumble of color and shapes and overlapping 
planes are smokestacks, seascapes, and brick walls, all reduced to 
funky hieroglyphic notations, which in their cartoony character 
seem to tap into American popular culture. In an almost indefin¬ 
able way, Davis s sensitivity captures the pulse of America—its 
gaudy advertising, its love of the new, its jazz, its mobility, its 
intensity and speed, even its rootlessness. 

Art Deco and the International Style 

While the skyscraper became the national emblem of America s 
modernity, the buildings themselves were aesthetically conserva¬ 
tive compared with European architectural developments, espe¬ 
cially the International Style. Their distinguishing characteristic 
was their height. By 1900, New York had become the home of the 
skyscraper, taking the lead from Chicago. Buildings became pro¬ 
gressively taller, with Cass Gilbert s 792-foot Woolworth Building 
dominating the cityscape in 1913. Aesthetically the new towers 
were very nineteenth-century, reflecting a variety of historical 
styles, often the Gothic. The wealth of the Roaring Twenties 
produced furious building campaigns, as architects competed to 
design the world s tallest building. Almost simultaneously, the 77- 
story Chrysler Building and 102-story Empire State Building 
went up in 1930. 

The Chrysler Building (fig. 28.44) designed by little-known 
architect William van Alen (1883-1954), is often considered the 
finest Art Deco skyscraper. Art Deco is a decorative-arts style 


that emerged in 1925 at the Exhibition of Decorative and 
Industrial Art held in Paris. Like the Bauhaus school, Art Deco 
concepts aimed to close the gap between quality design and mass 
production. It was an outgrowth of Art Nouveau, but it replaced 
the organic forms with a Machine Age geometric and streamlined 
look. Unlike the Bauhaus, Art Deco had no utopian goal; it 
was largely bourgeois, indulging in fantasy and lavishness. It was 
about decorative veneer, not idealistic substance. Within the 
geometry and streamlining of the machine aesthetic, it absorbed a 
wide range of historical references, from Cubist fracturing to the 
zigzag patterning of Native American and Pre-Columbian design. 
Deco designers loved lush colors, opulent materials, and shiny 
surfaces. Inspired by the geometry of machines, it generally drew 
together a variety of angular forms, often in jagged, staccato 
rhythms, and set them off against organic motifs that recall Art 
Nouveau or Jugendstil. We can see these qualities in the Chrysler 
Building. The geometry is streamlined in the tapering tower with 
its steadily receding arches. The flamelike triangular windows 
create a staccato rhythm, and the entire crown is sheathed in glis¬ 
tening stainless steel. Gargoyles duplicating the hood ornament 
for the 1929 Chrysler decorate the corners. 

The International Style came to America about this same time, 
appearing in Raymond M. FFood s 1931 McGraw-FFill Building in 
New York and in the 1929-32 Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 
Building (fig. 28.45) by George FFowe (1886-1955) and William 
E. Lescaze (1896-1969). That FFowe and Lescaze got to design a 
modern building is itself quite remarkable, since there was nothing 


1020 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 





else like it in America when it was planned. The building already 
presented an enormous financial risk, as potential renters were 
becoming scarce as the Great Depression deepened. Their building 
has many of the characteristics of High Modernism, but its float¬ 
ing, cantilevered blocks with glass curtain walls were compromised 
when the client insisted the piers get pushed to the outer perime¬ 
ter of the building, creating strong vertical accents and interfering 
with the horizontal windows and the thin tautness of the wall. As 
a result, the building seems more massive than its light, floating 
European counterparts (see fig. 28.32). But the Philadelphia

Fund Society Building, Philadelphia. 1929-32 


Savings Fund Society Building reflects its functionalism well, as 
each of the Constructivist-like blocks that we can see on the 
exterior was designed to accommodate a different purpose. 

Seeking the Spiritual 

In the 1910s, much of the American creative community turned 
its attention to producing a specifically American art. Writers, 
musicians, artists, and poets all felt that American culture was 
derived from Europe; now, they would seek to discover what was 
unique about the American experience and try to express it in an 
indigenous way. For some artists, like Stella in The Voice of the 
City (New York Interpreted) and Demuth in My Egypt , the answer 
lay in American modernity. Others looked to nature, going back 
to the pantheistic Romanticism of the Hudson River School and 
its successors. Stieglitz especially became preoccupied with this 
issue of an American art, deciding in the 1920s to represent only 
American artists and naming his last gallery, which he opened in 
1928, An American Place. Stieglitz himself became increasingly 
intolerant of modernity, initially resisting buying a radio or a car, 


CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 1021 


























and like so many others at the time shunning materialism to seek 
a spirituality in modern America. Stieglitz, who had published 
sections of Kandinskys Concerning the Spiritual in Art (see page 
959) in Camera Work , himself became preoccupied with visually 
capturing an equivalent of his emotions when confronting 
sublime nature. 

The artists that Stieglitz showed from the early 1920s until 
his death in 1946 were generally, but not always, preoccupied 
with finding a higher meaning in life within a materialistic mod¬ 
ern world, often focusing on nature. One was Georgia O’Keeffe, 
with whom Stieglitz became romantically involved in 1918 and 
later married. 

GEORGIA O’KEEFFE When Stieglitz first showed her work in 
1916, Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986) was making small abstract 
minimalist watercolors that evoked sublime landscapes. Toward 
1920, her presentation of nature evolved into close-ups of flowers, 
as seen in Black Iris III (fig. 28.46) of 1926, where the image is so 
magnified it virtually becomes abstract. We do not have to look 
far to find the pictorial source for O’Keeffe: Paul Strand. 
O’Keeffe briefly fell in love with the young, handsome Strand in

1917 and was smitten as well by the power of his photography, 
especially the use of the close-up image. This compositional 
device, she wrote, forced a viewer to see flowers with the same 
intensity that she did. But by abstracting the close-up, O’Keeffe 
accomplished much more: The forms of the flowers morph into 
the parts of a woman’s body, and the iris is redolent of female 
sexuality. The petals ethereally dissolve into their surroundings, 
seeming to become one with the rest of nature. 

Partly because of Stieglitz’s marketing, critics described 
O’Keeffe’s flowers as overtly erotic and sexual, which the new 
loose morality of the Roaring Twenties could accommodate. This 
interpretation outraged O’Keeffe, who denied that her pictures 
were about sexuality per se. And they are not. As with the banned 
sexually explicit novels of her friend the English author D. H. 
Lawrence, her paintings were not about lust but the uncontain- 
able surging force of nature, which includes the urge to procreate. 
Sexuality was portrayed as being natural, beautiful, and as essen¬ 
tial as a flower blossoming, disseminating pollen, and reproduc¬ 
ing. And if her wonderful organic flower, which seems to be 
growing before our very eyes, begins to take on the look of other 
objects, such as clouds, smoke, buttocks, and flesh, it only 
increases the sense of universal equivalence that she believed ran 
through all things. In this microcosm of an iris, O’Keeffe presents 
a macrocosm so large it encompasses the entire universe. 


1022 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 










EDWARD WESTON Due to both Strand and O’Keeffe, the 
close-up became a popular device with both painters and photog¬ 
raphers in the 1920s, and in the hands of some artists it had the 
same spiritual dimensions found in O’Keeffe’s paintings. Pepper 
(fig. 28.47) by the Californian Edward Weston (1886-1958) falls 
into this category, as the rippling gnarled vegetable is transformed 
through lighting and cropping to resemble, in some places, a 
curled up figure (the back facing the upper right corner, buttocks 
to the lower right) and, in other places, breasts, arms, and so on. 
Weston was inspired to work with sharp-focus photography after 
a visit to New York in 1922, where he met Stieglitz and Strand. 
He then abandoned Pictorialist photography. Using a large- 
format camera that allowed him to print from 4-by-5 inch or 8- 
by-10-inch negatives, he was able to achieve rich detail and highly 
refined, beautiful textures. In 1932, he founded, with Ansel 
Adams, Imogen Cunningham, and others, a San Francisco pho¬ 
tography group called f/64, a reference to the very small camera 
aperture that allowed for tremendous depth of field, and thus 
sharp, crisp images. 


Regionalism and National Identity 

While the New York avant-garde sought a national identity and 
spirituality using either images of modernity or compact abstract 
styles, a group of Midwest artists, headed by Grant Wood, 
Thomas Hart Benton, and John Stewart Curry, turned to “old- 
fashioned” representational art and regional imagery. Although 
trained in modern-art centers (Benton and Wood studied in 
Europe as well as in New York and Chicago), they generally 
preferred to work in the Midwest, where they came from and 
with which they identified. 

The most famous image produced by this group is American 
Gothic (fig. 28.48) by Grant Wood (1891-1942) of Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa. The picture was shown at the Art Institute of Chicago in 
1930, where it caused a stir and brought Wood to national attention. 
It was intended as a window into the Midwest world in which the 
artist grew up and lived. A fictitious father and spinster daughter 
are presented as the God-fearing descendants of stalwart pioneers 
who first worked the soil. They are dressed in old-fashioned clothes

and stand firmly against the march of progress. The style of their 
house, from which the title of the painting is taken, is Carpenter 
Gothic, a nineteenth-century style evoking both the humble mod¬ 
esty and old-fashioned ways of the residents as well as their reli¬ 
gious intensity, which parallels the fervor of the medieval period 
when Gothic cathedrals were built. Wood further emphasizes his 
characters’ faith by developing numerous crosses within the 
facade, and by putting a church steeple in the distant background. 

In addition to being hard-working and reverent, we also know 
these farmers are orderly and clean, as suggested by the crisp 
drawing and severe horizontal and vertical composition. This 
propriety also stems from the primness of the womans conserva¬ 
tive dress and hair and the suggestion that she carefully tends to 
the house, as she does to the plants on the front porch. The fig¬ 
ures’ harsh frontality, the man’s firm grasp on his pitchfork, and 
his overalls suggest that they are industrious and strong. There is 
no hint of modernity, and the simplicity and austerity of the 
setting suggests they are frugal. Nonetheless, many critics viewed 
Wood as ridiculing his sitters and their lifestyle, and indeed the 
painting does contain humor, such as the woman warily looking 
off to the side as if to make sure nothing untoward is occurring. 
But regardless of interpretation, no one seemed to deny that 
the picture captured something fundamentally American, and 
especially Midwestern. 


The Harlem Renaissance 

From 1910 to 1940, approximately 1.6 million African Americans 
fled the racism and poverty of the rural South for the cities of the 
industrial north, where they hoped to find jobs as well as justice 
and equality. In the North, the new migrants often discovered 
they had exchanged rural poverty for urban slums, and the racism 
encoded in Southern Jim Crow laws for prejudice, segregated 
neighborhoods, and second-class citizenship. Nonetheless, the 
confluence of blacks in New York’s Harlem and Chicago’s South 
Side resulted in a cultural flourishing devoted to self-discovery 
and to establishing a black identity, something white America had 
methodically denied African Americans. The movement was then 
called the New Negro Movement, although today it is generally 
known as the Harlem Renaissance, after its primary center, often 
described as its “capital. ” 

Leading this movement in literature, music, theater, and art 
was the Howard University philosopher Alain Locke 
(1886-1954), who called for a distinctive style that evoked a black 
sensibility and perspective. He advocated recapturing the African 
past and its art, which white avant-garde artists had already done, 
although presenting it from their own narrow perspective and 
using it to reflect their own needs and interests. Locke encouraged 
representations of African Americans and their lives as well as a

portrayal of the distinctive physical qualities of the race, just as 
African masks often stressed black physiognomy. In effect, he was 
advocating artists and writers to declare that Black is beautiful. In 
his promotion of a black aesthetic, he encouraged artists to depict 
a distinct African-American culture, one that departed from the 
Euro-American tradition and reflected the enormous contribu¬ 
tions Americans of African descent had made to American life 
and identity. 

Prior to the Harlem Renaissance, African-American fine 
artists made art that was inspired by the art that their Euro- 
American counterparts were producing, with the intention of 
“fitting in,” conforming, and appealing to market values, which 
were determined by white artists. They made the same landscapes, 
still lifes, and genre scenes, all devoid of black content. (However, 
in the crafts and folk art, such as quilts, metalwork, and furniture, 
and in music as well, African Americans were often influenced by 
African traditions.) With the Harlem Renaissance, artists began 
making African Americans the subject of their art. Although most 
major African-American artists worked within the Modernist tra¬ 
dition, they also offered an alternative to this tradition by making 
racial identity a prominent theme in their work. In effect, they 
made the subject of race and the power of its presentation as 
important as formal innovation. 

JACOB LAWRENCE The most famous painter to emerge from 
the Harlem Renaissance was Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000), who 
received his training as a teenager in the 1930s at the federally 
sponsored Harlem Art Workshop and Harlem Community Art 
Center. Lawrence regularly went to midtown to take in all the 
art the city had to offer, from a 1935 exhibition of African Art at 
the Museum of Modern Art, to Mexican textiles, to all of the 
latest European styles. In the late 1930s, he began making large 
narrative series dedicated to black leaders, including Harriet 
Tubman, Toussaint L’Ouverture, and Frederick Douglass. The 
images were small and modest, made of poster paint on cardboard 
or posterboard. 

Lawrence is best known for his Migration Series , begun in 
1940. In 60 images, Lawrence presented the reasons for blacks 
migrating north and their experiences in both the North and the 
South. While the series is anecdotal, the images did much of 
the talking through their abstraction, as seen in number 58, In 
the North the Negro Had Better Educational Facilities (fig. 
28.49). Three girls write numbers on a blackboard, but we do not 
see their faces, which would make them individuals. Instead, we 
see numbers and arms rising higher, suggesting elevation through 
education, and we see a clean slate for a clean start. The girls’ 
brightly colored dresses affirm life and happiness, while the 
jagged and pointed edges in their hair and skirts impart an energy 
and a quality of striving. Lawrence generally shows a collective 
black spirit, not an individual or individual expression. He is 
interested in a human spirit that relentlessly and energetically 
moves forward, building a better future. His sparse and beau¬ 
tifully colored pictures embody a remarkable psychology, which 
is often reinforced by the Modernist space of his pictures. Here, a 


flat field pushes the figures to the surface, prominently displaying 
them, and the composition’s geometry seems to reinforce the 
discipline of the students’ dedication to education. 

MEXICAN ART: SEEKING A 
NATIONAL IDENTITY 

The Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910 with the over¬ 
throw of the dictatorship of General Porfirio Diaz and ended in 
1921 with the formation of the reformist government of Alvaro 
Obregon, triggered a wave of nationalism within the cultural 
community, one that focused on indigenous traditions while 
rejecting European influences. A government building campaign 
resulted in a large number of impressive mural commissions, 
which in turn gave rise to a school of artists headed by Diego 
Rivera, David Siquieros, and Jose Clemente Orozco. Either 
socialists or Communists, the muralists proclaimed murals as the 
true art of the people. The Mexican muralists gained international 
renown and were especially popular in the United States, where 
they received important commissions, ironically from major 
capitalists such as the Rockefeller family. 

Diego Rivera 

Diego Rivera (1886-1957) is perhaps the best known of the 
three major muralists. He lived in Europe, primarily in Paris, 
from 1907 to 1921, and was an accomplished Cubist. By the late 
1910s, Rivera was consumed by the idea of creating a nationalis¬ 
tic revolutionary art through mural painting, and he traveled to 
Italy to study Renaissance murals. Upon returning to Mexico, 
he jettisoned his elite esoteric Cubism for the straightforward 
representational art of fifteenth-century Italy, giving it a monu- 
mentality that also echoed the strong simple forms of Aztec and 
Mayan art. Furthermore, he shunned easel painting, declaring 
it a bourgeois capitalistic art form, a commodity for the rich. 
He viewed his fresco murals as a public art, an art for the masses. 
He also felt his art should be about the indigenous people, not 
the Euro-Mexicans and their European customs. Consequently, 
many of his mural commissions are about national identity and 
the uniqueness of Mexican customs and tradition. 

Rivera was a Communist, and his politics, especially his cham¬ 
pioning of the common folk and labor, appear in his murals. From 
1930 to 1934, he received numerous commissions in the United 
States, and his representational art had a tremendous impact 
on American mural painting, which was proliferating due to 
support from Franklin D. Roosevelts s New Deal administration 
which provided artists with work. One major project was the 
lobby of the RCA building in Rockefeller Center. Entitled 
Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to a 
New and Better Future , it included a portrait of the Communist 
leader Lenin, which outraged the Rockefellers, who had com¬ 
missioned the mural. The Rockefellers paid Rivera but then 
destroyed the mural. Rivera remade it as Man , Controller of the

Universe (fig. 28.50) at the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes in 
Mexico City in 1934. The painting champions science and Com¬ 
munism, which, for Rivera, were the twin tools of progress. In 
the center of the composition we see Man, positioned under a 
telescope and with a microscope to his right (our left), indicating 
that humankind will control the future through science. Two 
crisscrossing ellipses of light seem to emanate from Man, one 
depicting a microscopic world, the other the cosmos. Below him 
is the earth, and the superior agricultural products generated by 
scientific discovery. To Man s left (our right), we see, sandwiched 
between the healthy microorganisms and a harmonious cosmos, 
Lenin holding hands with workers of different races. Beyond is a 
scene of healthy unified labor. To Man s right (our left) are the 
evils of capitalism. Between the ellipses showing diseased organ¬ 
isms and a clashing cosmos is a decadent bar scene depicting the 
well-heeled bourgeoisie, including John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Beyond 
are frightening soldiers and discontented, protesting laborers. 

FRIDA KAHLO A more remarkable, if less influential, artist 
from this period was Rivera s wife, Frida Kahlo (1907-1954). She 
was almost killed in a traffic accident when she was 18, and, when 
recuperating, she started painting, cultivating a folk style that 
reflected her strong interest in the power of nai've Colonial 
pictures (art often made by self-taught or little-trained artists) and 
such folk imagery as ex-votos (a Catholic folk image of religious 
devotion often created in gratitude for a special event in some¬ 
one’s life). Kahlo s imagery was personal, focusing on her state of 
mind, generally her tumultuous relationship with her philander¬ 
ing husband or her lifelong excruciating suffering from her 
injuries. She made easel pictures, often quite small, which, while 
focusing on herself, nonetheless deliberately placed her in a 


Mexican context. She often presented herself in traditional 
Mexican clothing and jewelry and with attributes associated with 
folk beliefs and superstition. 

We can see this focus on her own identity and psychology in 
her 1939 painting The Two Fridas (fig. 28.51), made when she and 
Rivera were divorcing. On the left is the European Frida, light- 
skinned, even sickly pale, and in Victorian dress, reflecting her 
father s Hungarian Jewish ancestry To the right sits the Mexican 
Frida, dark-skinned and in peasant costume, reflecting her 
mother s Indian and Creole background. More important, this is 
the Frida that Rivera wanted her to be. She holds a miniature por¬ 
trait of Rivera as a boy the source of the blood coursing through 
her and into the European Frida, who has cut the connection back 
to her Mexican self, in effect draining the blood, and life, out of 
the indigenous self. The exposed heart, dripping blood, and the 
miniature have the surreal drama found in the Mexican ex-votos 
that Kahlo so admired, while the crisp contours and minimal 
modeling of the figures and the bench, for example, echo their 
plain direct folk-art style. Contrasted with these simple unarticu¬ 
lated passages are meticulously detailed motifs, such as the hearts 
and lace, which change the texture of the image, making it all the 
more bizarre. Andre Breton was in Mexico in 1938 and declared 
Kahlo a Surrealist, a label she objected to, declaring she was not 
painting dreams but rather the reality of her life. Her pictures 
were not meant to churn the unconscious, but rather to reflect her 
own pain and suffering, both physical and psychological. 

MANUEL ALVAREZ BRAVO Breton also added photographer 
Manuel Alvarez Bravo (1902-2002) to his roster of Surrealists. 
Bravo, who was self-taught, was in the muralist circle in Mexico 
City and was equally preoccupied with creating a Mexican art.

Like Cartier-Bresson s images, Bravo s have an uncanny quality, 
sometimes due to an unusual juxtaposition of objects, sometimes 
simply because of a strange silence and mysterious shadows. In 
some respects, his Surrealism was the result of his quest to capture 
the magical essence of folk myths and superstitions, as seen in La 
Buena Fama Durmiendo {Good Reputation Sleeping) (fig. 28.52). 
Here, Bravo posed his model on the roof of the national arts 
school where he was teaching, having her lie on a Mexican blan¬ 
ket and binding her wrists, ankles, and feet as well as her pelvis 
and upper legs in bandages. He allows her pubic hair to show, and 
surrounds her with thorny cactus pears. Breton wanted to use this 
image for the cover of a 1940 international Surrealist exhibition he 
was organizing for Mexico City. Owing to the jarring relationship 
of prickly pears to the model, the exposed crotch, the strange 
tightly wound bandages, and the violent stains on the wall, it is 
not difficult to understand why But Bravo s motivation was not 
just about evoking the pain, suffering, violence, and desire associ¬ 
ated with sex; he also wanted to encompass the intensity of local 
legends that went back centuries. In Mexican folklore, for exam¬ 
ple, the thorny pears are supposed to ward off danger during 
sleep. The bandages were inspired by watching dancers bind their 


CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 1027 


















feet, which reminded Bravo of Pre-Columbian sculptural reliefs 
of dancers, which were related to the earth-goddess Coatlicue, 
who was conceived without sexual intercourse. The image is a 
wonderful exercise in doctrinaire Surrealism, but at the same time 
it is steeped in the myth and magic of Mexican tradition, espe¬ 
cially drawing upon indigenous and folk culture. 

THE EVE OF WORLD WAR II 

In October 1929, the New York stock market crashed, unleashing 
the Great Depression that fanned out around the globe. The dep¬ 
rivation it inflicted lasted an excruciating 16 years. In Europe and 
Asia, fascists rose to power—Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in 
Germany, Franco in Spain, and Hirohito in Japan. Communist 
Russia became totalitarian with the emergence of Stalin in the late 
1920s. In 1931, Japan invaded continental Asia. 

For European artists, the rise of Hitler was the defining influ¬ 
ence. To those bent on establishing a democratic classless world, 
his policies were insane. He was aggressively militaristic, believ¬ 
ing great nations are based on a powerful, ruthless military. He 
declared Aryans, Germans of Scandinavian and Teutonic descent, 
to be a master race, superior to all others, and claimed Germany s 
economic and political decline resulted from its ethnic and lin¬ 
guistic diversity. He especially faulted Jews and Communists for 
undermining German superiority, and by the late 1930s, Jews, 


Slavs, Gypsies, gays, the mentally and physically impaired, as well 
as Communists and political dissenters, were imprisoned, sent 
to work camps, or executed. The utopian dream of Dada, 
Surrealism, De Stijl, Constructivism, and the Bauhaus proved to 
be just that, a dream. Hitler forced the closing of the Bauhaus in 
1933, and in 1937, the Nazis staged a “Degenerate Art” exhibition 
in Munich, denigrating German avant-garde artists in full public 
view. In America, social realism and representational regional art 
gained at the expense of avant-garde art. While regionalists 
painted stoic or dynamic scenes of American fortitude and drive, 
others focused on the plight of the urban poor. 

America: The Failure of Modernity 

The avant-garde continued to work in abstraction through the 
1930s, but in an era dominated by the terrible social ills of the 
Great Depression, it became increasingly difficult for artists not 
to be socially concerned. Many in the avant-garde got involved by 
becoming socialists or Communists and by supporting the labor 
movement, even forming their own unionlike organizations. But 
for many artists, political activity was not enough. Now, more 
and more artists worked in a style called Social Realism, a repre¬ 
sentational format that focused on such pervasive problems as 
poverty, labor oppression, suffering migrant workers, alienation 
resulting from increased urbanization and industrialization, and 
racism, especially as seen in the Ku Klux Klan lynchings.

1028 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






















EDWARD HOPPER One of the most powerful representational 
painters of the period was Edward Hopper (1882-1967), who was 
based in New York. His pictures are saturated with the alienation 
associated with life in the big city, and more generally with modern 
America. A classic Hopper is Early Sunday Morning (fig. 28.53) 
of 1930. The image is frightening in its uncanny quiet and empti¬ 
ness, qualities reinforced by the severe frozen geometry of the 
composition. The second-floor windows suggest a different story 
for each apartment, but none is forthcoming as their inhabitants 
remain secreted behind curtains and shades. A strange relation¬ 
ship exists between the fire hydrant, the barber-shop pole, and the 
void of the square awning-framed window between them, an 
uneasiness that we project onto the unseen inhabitants of the 
building. The harsh morning light has a theatrical intensity. 
Hopper’s only loves outside of art were film and theater, and his 
paintings have a cinematic and staged quality that intimates that 
something is about to happen. His pictures are shrouded in mys¬ 
tery, and because their settings are distinctly American, the dreary 
psychology he portrays becomes distinctly American as well. 

WALKER EVANS The largest art patron during the Great 
Depression was the United States government, which put tens of 
thousands of unemployed artists to work through the Works 
Project Administration and Federal Art Project, important com¬ 
ponents of Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal. What was so 
remarkable about these programs was their lack of racial, ethnic, 
or gender discrimination, which resulted in financial support for 
women and minorities. One especially influential project was the 
Farm Security Administration (FSA). Designed to document the 
suffering and poverty of both rural and urban Americans, the FSA 
hired about 20 photographers at a time to record the desperate

conditions of the poor. Their images were then distributed to the 
media, where they often had a powerful impact on public opinion. 

One of the first photographers hired in 1935 was Walker 
Evans (1903-1975), who was fired two years later because he was 
stubbornly difficult and did not make the sort of images that the 
FSA was looking for: images that dramatically portrayed how 
wretched the conditions were in America. Instead, his subtle pho¬ 
tographs focus on the nation’s psychology, showing its gloom and 
alienation, much as Hopper’s paintings did. This can be readily 
seen in the work reproduced here (fig. 28.54). We see a town with¬ 
out people, where the cemetery, workers’ row houses, and treeless 
industrial landscape of smokestacks and telephone poles summa¬ 
rize the denizens’ lives, succinctly conveying the meaningless, 
rote, empty life cycle of the American worker. In addition to 
creating a tragic mood, Evans’s genius lies in the brilliant formal 
play of his detailed compositions that subtly pit light against dark 
and vertical against horizontal. 

DOROTHEA LANGE One of the most famous images from the 
FSA project is Dorothea Fanges (1895-1965) Migrant Mother, 
California (fig. 28.55). Using the sharp-focus photography that 
had become commonplace by the 1930s, Fange created a power¬ 
ful image that in its details captures the sitter’s destitution, and in 


CHAPTER 28 ART BETWEEN THE WARS 1029 





















its complex composition of hands, arms, and turned heads, the 
family’s emotional distress. Because of this photograph and an 
accompanying news story, the government rushed food to 
California, and eventually opened relief camps for migrant work¬ 
ers. The immediate impact of this poignant photograph testifies to 
the overpowering credibility that the medium of photography can 
have, and we have to wonder if the article about the migrant 
workers had not included Lange s photograph if the government 
would have sent aid. 

Europe: The Rise of Fascism 

If America had to contend with economic deprivation in the 
1930s, the situation was even worse in Europe, where the dark 
cloud of fascism added to the gloom of the worldwide financial 
collapse. In rapid succession, Italy, Germany, and Spain became 
fascist dictatorships, depriving citizens of their civil liberties and 
threatening the peace and security of the surrounding nations. 
The Enlightenment logic that had ushered in some 200 years of 
progress seemed to be crumbling, replaced by a world that had 
lost its sense as a large portion of the European population gave 
up their freedom and followed Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco 
down an authoritarian path that ended in World War II. Many 
artists responded to this threat to civilization. Among the first 


was Max Ernst, who, by the late 1920s in Paris presciently saw the 
threat that was coming to Western civilization. Die Game Stadt 
(see fig. 28.12), which Ernst made in 1935-36 after the rise of 
Hitler and which was discussed earlier in the chapter in the con¬ 
text of Surrealism, is more than just a dreamscape prompted by 
grattage and aimed at provoking our own subconscious—it is an 
announcement that such basic human urges as greed and pride 
will condemn humans to failure and is a premonition of World 
War II. 

MAX BECKMANN AND GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM No 

one movement or style had a monopoly on making art protesting 
the rise of fascism. Certainly, postwar German Expressionists, 
such as Kollwitz, and Berlin Dadaist were predisposed to politi¬ 
cal protest. German Expressionism continued throughout the 
1920s and 1930s, taking on forms quite different from Die Briicke 
and Der Blaue Reiter but nonetheless retaining a sense of vio¬ 
lence, suffering, and the grotesque that can be traced back to the 
Renaissance. Although we looked at George Grosz within the 
context of Berlin Dada, he is generally viewed as a postwar 
German Expressionist, which considering the clear political 
nature and narrative character of a work like Germany , A Winter's 
Tale (see fig. 28.6) is perhaps a more accurate label. Another post¬ 
war Expressionist active since the 1910s was Max Beckmann

(1884-1950), whose art tended to be more universal than Grosz s, 
focusing on the folly and despair of existence. Beckmann s pes¬ 
simistic view of human nature stems from his experience in World 
War I, which caused him to become an Expressionist in order to 
“reproach God for his errors. ” In the early 1930s, he began work¬ 
ing in his final style, seen in Departure (fig. 28.56), which is one of 
nine enormous triptyches (inspired by the triptyches of 
Hieronymus Bosch) that the artist made in the last 20 years of his 
life. The complex symbolism in the flanking panels represents life 
itself, seen as endless misery filled with all kinds of physical and 
spiritual pain. The bright-colored center panel represents “the 
King and Queen hav[ing] freed themselves of the torture of life.” 
Beckmann assigned specific meaning to each action and figure: 
The woman trying to make her way in the dark with the aid of 
a lamp is carrying the corpse of her memories, evil deeds, and 
failure, from which no one can ever be free so long as life beats its 
drum. But Beckmann believed that viewers did not need a key to 
his iconography; any interpretation would inevitably be similar 
to his, at least in spirit, if not in the details. The grotesquely dis¬ 
torted figures, strident angular lines, jagged forms, compressed 
claustrophobic space, and heavy, morbid black line encasing 
everything reinforce the insane, hell-on-earth mood of this night¬ 
marish image. 

The triptych’s rich allegory and symbolism reflects 
Beckmann s early study of the Old Masters and his deep appreci¬ 
ation for the grim and disturbing imagery of Bosch and 
Griinewald (see pages 492-93 and 635-37). But such narratives of 
mythic proportions, which only start appearing in Beckmann s art 
in the 1930s, seem to reflect the artists familiarity with Parisian 
Surrealism. The Frankfurt-based Beckmann was a regular visitor 
to Paris, and it appears he returned with more than just a sem¬ 
blance of Picasso s palette, for he seems to have also brought 
home the Surrealist emphasis on myth. His hell-on-earth 
nightmare of bizarre and sadistic events relies on disjointed 
puzzling motifs that parallel the devices he saw in the dream 
imagery of the Surrealists. 

Shortly after Beckmann began Departure , life itself became 
surreal in Germany, for Hitler became chancellor in 1933. Now 
the Nazis turned from bullying and threats to overt violence 
toward their perceived enemies and inferiors, anyone they viewed 
as being at odds with the “Aryan” ideals of the Third Reich. 
German avant-garde art was deemed depraved and therefore 
ridiculed. The artists were forbidden from buying art supplies. 
Eventually, their work was confiscated from museums and either 
destroyed or sold in Switzerland to raise money. In 1937, the 
Nazis removed some 650 pieces of German modern art from 
museums and presented them in an exhibition entitled Degenerate 
Arp which opened in Munich and then toured Germany for three 
years. Beckmann was represented in this humiliating exhibition, 
an event that contributed to Ernst Ludwig Kirchner s suicide. But 
by 1937, Beckmann was in the United States, a path taken by 
numerous other artists, including Moholy-Nagy, who established 
a new Bauhaus in Chicago, today the Institute of Design at the 
Illinois Institute of Technology.

Archiv, Berlin 

JOHN HEARTFIELD John Heartfield, the Berlin Dadist who, 
along with Grosz, Hausmann, and Hoch, played a seminal role in 
the development of photomontage in the early 1920s, now took 
aim at the Nazis, creating some of his most powerful work. As in 
the Middle Ages, So in the Third Reich (fig. 28.57) is a wonderful 
example of his montage technique, which consisted of collaging 
disparate images together and then photographing them. In this 
poster, he juxtaposes a Nazi victim crucified on a swastika with a 
Gothic image of the figure of humanity punished for its sins on 
the wheel of divine judgment. Heartfield was not interested in the 
original meaning of the Gothic motif; he used it to imply that 
the Nazis had ruthlessly transported the nation back to what he 
viewed as the dark barbaric past of the Middle Ages. 

PABLO PICASSO In 1936, civil war broke out in Spain when 
conservatives loyal to the king and under the leadership of Franco 
(the Nationalists) tried to overthrow the popularly elected leftist, 
republican government (the Republicans or Loyalists). In some 
ways, it was a rehearsal for World War II. Hitler and Mussolini

Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid. On Permanent Loan from the Museo del Prado, Madrid 


provided military and political support for the Nationalists, who 
included monarchists, fascists, and Catholics. The Loyalists con¬ 
sisted of Communists, socialists, and Catalan and Basque sepa¬ 
ratists, as well as the International Brigade, made up of volunteers 
from all over the world. On April 26, 1937, Hitlers Nazi pilots 
used saturation bombing to attack the undefended Basque town 
of Guernica, killing thousands of civilians. Picasso, like most of 
the free world, was outraged, and responded by painting Guernica 
(fig. 28.58), an enormous black, white, and gray mural that he 
exhibited as a protest at the Spanish Republican Pavilion of the 
1937 Paris International Exposition. He pulled every artistic 
device out of his Cubist and Surrealist arsenal to create a night¬ 
marish scene of pain, suffering, grief, and death. We see no air¬ 
planes and no bombs, and the electric lightbulb is the only sign of 
the modernity that made the bombing possible. 

The symbolism of the scene resists exact interpretation, 
despite several traditional elements: The mother and her dead 
child are descendants of the Pieta, the woman with the lamp who 
vaguely recalls the Statue of Liberty suggests enlightenment, and 
the dead fighter clutching a broken sword is a familiar emblem of 
heroic resistance. We also sense the contrast between the menac¬ 
ing human-faced bull, which we know Picasso intended to repre¬ 
sent the forces of brutality and darkness, and the dying horse, 
which stands for the people. 

Picasso insisted, however, that the mural was not a political 
statement about fascism, and it is interesting that many of the fig¬ 
ures were used quite differently in Picasso s earlier work. The 
horse and bull are motifs from the bullfight, which Picasso had 


been using since the early 1930s as a metaphor for sexual conflict. 
The presence of the huge vulva-shaped tear on the side of the 
horse is certainly not a coincidence. Nor is that of the same sex¬ 
ual orifice on the inside of the sword-holding arm broken off of a 
Classical statue of a soldier. Nor is it coincidence that the flames 
on the back of the supplicating woman on the right remind us of 
the sawtooth groin of the sexually aggressive dancer in Three 
Dancers (see fig. 28.9), or that the quarter-moon silhouetted 
against a rooster s head just beyond her flailing breast reminds us 
of the same dancer s moon-shaped head. And is it coincidence 
that this figure, who resembles a Mary Magdalene at the Cross, 
also brings to mind Goyas supplicating rebel in The Third of 
May , 1808 (see fig. 24.3)? If it were not for the title, there is not 
much to indicate this is not another of Picasso s images about the 
tormenting psychology of sexual conflict that we saw as far back 
as Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (see fig. 27.5) of 1907. 

But the title cannot be ignored—nor the smashed statue of a 
soldier, the suffering women and children, the political use of the 
painting at the International Exposition, and the fact that it was 
made in response to the destruction of Guernica. When Picasso 
denied that this was an antifascist picture, he may very well have 
meant in part that this monumental mural was more than just 
mundane propaganda against Franco and his ilk. Like Beckmanns 
Departure , we cannot help but feel that this horrifying image is 
meant to portray the psychology of a world in perpetual conflict 
and misery—albeit using sexual imagery to convey this message, 
but this is what Picasso knew best. In Guernica , however, Picasso, 
unlike Beckmann, does not provide a boat to take us away to safety.

Postwar to Postmodern, 

1945-1980 



S cholars traditionally view world war ii ( 1939 - 45 ) as a 

turning point for the art world, the time when its focus shifted from Paris 
to New York and when America s first major art movement, Abstract 
Expressionism, captured the world’s attention, even dominating world art. 
In fact, the 1950s, not the 1940s, were the watershed for the second half of the 


century. It was then that Duchamp s preoccupation with how art 
functions became a driving force as the decade progressed. 
Likewise, many artists became obsessed with the concept, also 
rooted in the early Cubism of Picasso and Braque, that art and 
image making were a form of language, and they dedicated their 
work to revealing the structure of this visual language and the 
complex ways it could be used to present ideas and opinions, even 
to deceive and manipulate. 

It was also in the 1950s that artists, again following Duchamp s 
lead, realized that art need not be limited to the traditional medi¬ 
ums, such as oil on canvas or cast bronze or chiseled marble. It 
did not have to hang on a wall or sit on a pedestal. Artists could 
use anything to make art, and by the late 1950s and 1960s, they 
did. They made art with televisions, film, junk, earth, fluorescent 
lights, steel tiles, acrylics, entire environments, postcards, and 
words. Performance Art, Earthworks, Conceptual Art, Mail 
Art, Happenings, and Video Art are just a handful of the move¬ 
ments and mediums that sprang up from the mid-1950s through 
the 1970s. 

In part, this burst of new mediums reflects the expansive spirit 
of the period, especially in America. World War II ended 16 years 
of financial depression and deprivation, and by the 1950s, the

United States had become a nation of consumers. Returning 
soldiers, eager to resume their lives, married and had children in 
record numbers, creating the baby-boom generation. Americans 
in large numbers moved from cities to new cookie-cutter tract 
houses in the suburbs. And as never before, they shopped—these 
new homes often had several cars, power boats, barbeque grills 
and lawn furniture, washing machines, self-cleaning ovens, televi¬ 
sions sets, transistor radios, stereo record players, and home- 
movie cameras and projectors. As suggested by these last items, 
Americans as never before chased the latest technology, which 
was developing quickly in part due to World War II and now the 
Cold War waged between the Communist U.S.S.R and the 
democratic West and which was characterized by fighter jets, 
helicopters, the hydrogen bomb, missiles, rocket ships, satellites, 
and space travel. 

The new postwar American lifestyle, however, was not 
equally available to all. Magazines, newspapers, film, and the new 
medium of television reflected the reality of a distinct hierarchy 
within American democracy, with white males heading up a patri¬ 
archal society that viewed women, people of color, and gays as 
second-class citizens. It was a decade of conformity, symbolized 
at one extreme by the white businessman in a gray flannel suit 
climbing the corporate ladder while the prim housewife tended 
the family and house, played golf and tennis at the country club, 
and participated in the PTA and church activities. Beatniks, Zen 
Buddhists, avant-garde jazz musicians, bikers, and urban gangs of

juvenile delinquents established alternative lifestyles in the late 
1940s and 1950s. 

But it was the Civil Rights Movement that first seriously chal¬ 
lenged the status quo in the second half of the 1950s, gaining 
tremendous momentum in the following decade. Spurred also by 
the Vietnam War (1959-75), which generated persistent antiwar 
protests, the mid-1960s began a period of social upheaval that 
reached a feverish pitch in the 1970s, producing the feminist 
movement, Gay Pride, Black Power, Gray Power, and environ¬ 
mental groups such as Greenpeace. It was an age of liberation 
aimed at shattering the status quo and questioning the validity of 
any claim to superiority or fixed truth. And in the forefront was 
art, which by the 1950s was challenging the existence of absolutes. 
But before this artistic revolution could occur, the center of the art 
world had to move from Paris to New York. This “coup,” often 
referred to as the “Triumph of New York Painting,” coincided 
with the rise of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s. 

EXISTENTIALISM IN NEW YORK: 
ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM 

Abstract Expressionism evolved out of Surrealism, which traced 
its roots to the Dada movement of the 1910s (see page 985). Like 
the Surrealists, the Abstract Expressionists were preoccupied with 
a quest to uncover universal truths. In this sense, their heritage 
goes back to Kandinsky and Malevich as well (see pages 958 and 
966). In many respects, Abstract Expressionism is the culmination 
of the concerns of the artists of the first half of the twentieth 


century. But the Abstract Expressionists were also driven by a 
deep-seated belief in Existentialism, a philosophy that came to the 
fore with the devastation caused by World War II. The war shat¬ 
tered not only faith in science and logic, but even the very concept 
of progress, the idea that it was possible to create a better world. 
A belief in absolute truths had been abandoned. 

Existentialism maintains that there are no absolute truths—no 
ultimate knowledge, explanations, or answers—and that life is a 
continuous series of subjective experiences from which each indi¬ 
vidual learns and then correspondingly responds in a personal way. 
Essential to this learning process is facing the direst aspects of 
human existence—fear of death, the absurdity of life, and alienation 
from individuals, society, and nature—and taking responsibility 
for acts of free will without any certain knowledge of what is right 
or wrong, good, or bad. The Abstract Expressionists, like so many 
intellectuals after the war, embraced this subjective view of the 
world. Their art was a personal confrontation with the moment, 
reflecting upon their physical, psychological, and social being. 

The Bridge from Surrealism to Abstract 
Expressionism: Arshile Gorky 

Surrealism dominated New York art in the early 1940s. In 
late 1936, the seven-year-old Museum of Modern Art mounted 
the blockbuster exhibition Fantastic Art , Dada , and Surrealism , 
an eye-opener for many New York artists. Some artists not con¬ 
verted by the exhibition were nevertheless swayed by the 
dramatic influx of European artists who fled the Continent 
shortly before and during World War II. Andre Breton, Marcel 


1036 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 
































Duchamp, Andre Masson, and Max Ernst were just a few of 
the many artists and intellectuals who sought the safety of 
Manhattan and were a powerful presence in the art world. 
Peggy Guggenheim, a flamboyant American mining heiress 
who had been living in Europe, returned to New York and 
opened a gallery, Art of This Century, which featured Surrealism. 
Surrealism was everywhere , and many New York artists took to 
it enthusiastically. 

Just as Dada developed into Surrealism, New York Surrealism 
seamlessly evolved into Abstract Expressionism. The transforma¬ 
tion occurred when all of the symbols and suggestions of myths 
and primordial conditions disappeared, and images dissolved into 
a complete abstraction containing no obvious references to the 
visible world. We can see the beginning of this process in the 
paintings of Arshile Gorky (1904-1948), an Armenian immigrant, 
whose family fled Armenia to escape the genocide of the ruling 
Turks of the Ottoman Empire. Gorky’s mother died of starvation 
in his arms in a Russian refugee camp. By the 1930s, Gorky was 
in New York, where, over the next decade, his Cubist style began 
to evolve toward complete abstraction. At his wife’s farm in 
Connecticut, he would dash off minimal abstract line drawings 
inspired by nature. In the studio, he would then develop, often 
using preparatory drawings, these linear patterns into paintings, 


similar to his 1944 surrealistically titled The Liver Is the Cock's 
Comb (fig. 29.1). 

Here, we see wiry black-line drawing and washes of predom¬ 
inantly red, blue, yellow, and black playing off of one another, 
giving a sense of how the composition developed as a series of 
psychological reactions with one mark or color triggering the 
next, and so on until completion. While the painting has echoes of 
Miro’s biomorphic shapes (see fig. 28.13), Massons automatic 
drawing (see page 995), and Kandinsky’s color and cosmic chaos 
(see fig. 27.14), it is more abstract and flatter than the work of his 
predecessors, with the image kept close to the surface. We cannot 
safely read much into the picture other than a feeling of a land¬ 
scape filled with some kind of organic animation, perhaps geni¬ 
talia and figures, which seem eruptive, violent, and in conflict. In 
fact, many scholars have suggested that Gorky’s abstractions refer 
to the Turkish slaughter of Armenians, but again, the picture is 
too abstract to interpret. What stands out as a prominent theme is 
the art process itself, our sense of how the image was made and 
how it seems to have been determined by Gorky’s own powerful 
emotions. Gorky was one of the last two artists that Breton 
anointed a Surrealist, a label Gorky rejected, since he undoubt¬ 
edly saw himself as expressing his innermost feelings and memo¬ 
ries, not exploring his repressed self.

Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) 



From “My Painting” 

In 1947 , when these remarks were recorded , Pollock rejected the usual 
easel format by placing his unstretched canvases directly on the floor. 
Using ordinary paint , he claimed he was not just throwing paint but 
delineating some real thing in the air above the canvas. 



M y painting does not come from the easel. I hardly ever stretch 
my canvas before painting. I prefer to tack the unstretched 
canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance of a hard 
surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more a part of 
the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four 
sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the method of the 
Indian sand painters of the West. 


I continue to get further away from the usual painter s tools such 
as easel, palette, brushes, etc. I prefer sticks, trowels, knives and drip¬ 
ping fluid paint or a heavy impasto with sand, broken glass and other 
foreign matter added. 

When I am in my painting, I’m not aware of what I’m doing. It is 
only after a sort of “get acquainted” period that I see what I have been 
about. I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, 
etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come 
through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the 
result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and 
take, and the painting comes out well. 

The source of my painting is the unconscious. I approach painting 
the same way I approach drawing. That is direct—with no preliminary 
studies. The drawings I do are relative to my painting but not for it.

Abstract Expressionism: Action Painting 

Three years later, in 1947, Jackson Pollock made the physical act 
of energetically applied paint—the gesture—the undisputed focus 
of painting. This is not to say that his abstract gesture paintings 
are just about the art process, because that process is now a 
metaphor for the human condition, which previously had been 
represented through hieroglyphs and biomorphic forms. Almost 
simultaneously, a second artist emerged, Willem de Kooning, who 


similarly employed bold gestural abstraction to express his inner¬ 
most feelings. 

JACKSON POLLOCK Through the 1930s, Jackson Pollock 
(1912-1956) was a marginal figure in the art world who worked 
odd jobs, including being a custodian at what is today called the 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In the early 1940s, just when 
he started Jungian psychoanalysis, he became a hardcore 
Surrealist, making crude but powerful paintings filled with

slapdash hieroglyphs, totems, and references to primitive myth, 
whipped about in a swirling sea of paint. His big break came in 
1943 when Peggy Guggenheim exhibited his work at her gallery, 
Art of This Century, and gave him a stipend to paint. 

At the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1948, Pollock unveiled his 
first gesture or action paintings, the latter term being coined in 
the 1950s by art critic Harold Rosenberg (1906-1978). A famous 
example of this style is Autumn Rhythm: Number 30 (fig. 29.2) of 
1950, an 8-by-l 7-foot wall of house paint that was applied by 
dripping, hurling, pouring, and splattering when the unstretched 
canvas was on the floor. Pollock had worked on it from all four 
sides, and he claimed that its source was his unconscious. (See 
Primary Source , page 1038.) Despite the apparent looseness of his 
style, Pollock exerted great control over his medium by changing 
the viscosity of the paint, the size of the brush or stick he used to 
apply the paint, and the speed, reach, and direction of his own 
movements, and he rejected many paintings when the paint did 
not fall as anticipated. The energy of the painting is overwhelm¬ 
ing, and from its position on a wall the work looms above us like 
a frozen wave. Our eye jumps from one stress to another—from 
a white blob, to a black splash, to a Masson-like automatic line, 
and so on. There is no focus upon which the eye can rest. Because 
of these even stresses throughout the image, Pollock s composi¬ 
tions are also often described as allover paintings. 

Pollock constructed his picture as he went along, with each 
new move playing off the previous one, and emotional intuition 
dictating the next gesture. The resulting image is not just a record 
of the physical self, but also of the psychological being. Because 
the artist must face the challenge of the bare canvas and the risk¬ 
taking responsibility of making each mark, painting becomes a 
metaphor for the challenges of the human condition and the risks 
inherent in taking responsibility for one’s actions, particularly in 
an Existentialist world. World War II dashed the blind belief in 
the superiority of science, progress, and utopian societies. The 
one thing that could be trusted and believed in was the self, and 
that became the sole subject of Abstract Expressionist painting. 

WILLEM DE KOONING Pollocks style was too personal to 
spawn significant followers. The gesture painter who launched an 
entire generation of painters was Willem de Kooning 
(1904-1997), a Dutch immigrant, who quietly struggled at his art 
for decades in New York s Greenwich Village. Encouraged by his 
friend and mentor Arshile Gorky, de Kooning made Picasso- 
inspired Cubist-Surrealist paintings in the 1940s, mostly of 
women. He finally got his first one-person show in 1948, at the 
Egan Gallery, when he was 44. The radical works he presented 
appeared to be total abstractions of dramatically painted curving 
lines and shapes that entirely covered the canvas with the same 
evenness as in Pollock s allover paintings. 

Despite the spontaneity implied by the bravura paint han¬ 
dling, the pictures were laboriously crafted, often using methods 
similar to those of the Surrealists. For example, de Kooning fired 
his imagination by pinning line drawings on his canvas, not only 
at the beginning but throughout the process. Charcoal lines

drawn on dried paint to both provoke and experiment with com¬ 
position sometimes remained in the final picture. He jump-started 
other paintings by inscribing large letters across the canvas. Like 
Pollock, he constructed the paintings through a continuous 
process of gestural reactions based on intuition and emotion, with 
the resulting marks reflecting his presence, feeling, and uncontrol¬ 
lable urges. Unlike Pollock, however, de Kooning s Expressionist 
paint handling retained the push-pull of Cubist space and compo¬ 
sition, with one painterly form residing above or below another. 

De Kooning shocked the art world with his second exhibition, 
held at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1953. He did the unthinkable 
for an Abstract Expressionist: He made representational paint¬ 
ings, depicting women, as seen in Woman I (fig. 29.3), a work he 
struggled with from 1950 to 1952. It now became clear that the 
curvilinear patterning of the earlier abstractions was as sexual as 
everyone had suspected, or as the critic Tom Hess put it, the 
works were “covert celebrations of orgiastic sexuality.” De 
Kooning reportedly painted and completely repainted Woman I

hundreds of times on the same canvas, and he also made numer¬ 
ous other paintings of women in the summer of 1952 when he was 
in East Hampton on Long Island, New York. The process of 
making the picture was almost as important as the final product, 
as though it were a ritualistic catharsis of sorts. 

Woman I is by far the most violent and threatening of numer¬ 
ous paintings in the Women series, the other women having a 
neutral appearance and embodying a broad range of attributes. 
Nonetheless, de Kooning intended Woman I to be equally 
unfixed in meaning, or as open to interpretation. He was sur¬ 
prised that viewers did not see the humor in his threatening, 
wide-eyed, snarling figure, which was based as much on contem¬ 
porary advertisements of models smoking Camel cigarettes as on 
primitive fertility goddesses, such as the Paleolithic Woman of 
Willendorf(see fig. 1.14), both of which the artist cited as sources. 
In the Women series, as in all of his paintings, de Kooning played 
out his own ambivalent emotions, which, because they constantly 
changed, allowed him to keep repainting his figure. 

Abstract Expressionism: Color-Field Painting 

Abstract Expressionism had a flip side. If one side was gestural 
painting, then the other was color-field painting. Instead of bom¬ 
bastic brushstrokes and the overt drama of paint, these painters 
used large meditative planes of color to express the innermost pri¬ 
mal qualities that linked them to universal forces. The objective of 
the color-field painters, like that of their gestural counterparts, 
was to project the sublime human condition as they themselves 
felt it. The principal color-field painters—Mark Rothko, Barnett 
Newman, and Clifford Still—all started out by making myth- 
inspired abstract Surrealist paintings in the 1940s and were close 
friends until 1952. 

MARK ROTHKO Mark Rothko (1903-1970) ranks among the 
best-known color-field painters. His paintings from the 1940s 
draw heavily from Greek tragedy, such as Aeschylus’ Oresteia , 
and from Christ s Passion cycle and death—scenes with a harrow¬ 
ing psychology where the lone individual faces ultimate truths 
about existence, death, and spirituality. But all suggestion of figu¬ 
ration disappeared in 1947. In 1949, Rothko arrived at his mature 
style, from which he did not deviate for the remainder of his life. 

Now, Rothkos paintings consisted of flat planes of color 
stacked directly on top of one another, as in the 10-foot-high 1953 
work No. 61 (Rust and Blue) (fig. 29.4). There is no longer any 
storytelling, nor any hieroglyphics or symbols, even in the title. 
But the painting is still mythic, for the artist has painted what he 
himself has confronted, the inevitable void of our common future 
and our sense of mystical oneness with unseen cosmic forces, a 
theme reminiscent of Caspar David Friedrich s Abbey in an Oak 
Forest (see fig. 24.8). Rothko s subject, he explained, was “tragedy, 
ecstasy, doom, and so on.” His ethereal planes are so thin, color 
glimmers through from behind and below, creating a shimmering 
spiritual light. Their edges are ragged, and like clouds dissipating 
in the sky, they seem precariously fragile. Although the painting

Blue, Brown on Blue). 1953. Oil on canvas, 115 3 /x 91V (2.94 x 2.32 m).

is not about process, we feel Rothko s hand building up the planes 
with individual marks, giving the work a poignant organic qual¬ 
ity. Space is paradoxically claustrophobic and infinite. On the one 
hand, the planes literally crowd the picture to the edges and hover 
at the very front of the picture plane, while on the other hand, the 
pervasive blue ground seems to continue forever, uncontained by 
the edge of the canvas and suggesting infinity. Enormous shifts in 
scale give a sense of the sublime. Note, for instance, the tiny, thin 
wisp of soft white on the bottom of the middle plane, which 
seems so insignificant in comparison to the enormous planes and 
the vast size of the canvas. 

Regardless of the palette, whether bright yellows and oranges 
or the more moody blues and browns in No. 61 , the colors in a 
Rothko painting have a smoldering resonance that makes the 
image seem to glow from within and evoke a spiritual aura. 
Rothko wanted viewers to stand close to his enormous iconic 
images, which would tower over them, and where they would be 
immersed in this mystical void of the unknown future, as if stand¬ 
ing on the precipice of infinity and death. After making a series of 
predominantly dark paintings, Rothko committed suicide in 1970. 


1040 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



New York Sculpture: 

David Smith and Louise Nevelson 

Like the Abstract Expressionist painters, the avant-garde sculp¬ 
tors of the postwar period were originally Surrealists, and most 
were similarly steeped in Existentialist philosophy Some, like 
David Smith, developed their compositions as they worked on 
their sculptures, which were largely abstract. Others, like Louise 
Nevelson, retained the hieroglyphic signs of Surrealism but now 
began working on an enormous scale, in part spurred by the scale 
of Abstract Expressionist painting. 

Along with Alexander Calder (see page 1001), who returned 
to America with World War II, David Smith (1906-1965) was per¬ 
haps the most visible American sculptor at midcentury. He began 
as a painter, but upon seeing illustrations of welded steel sculpture 
by Picasso and Gonzalez (see pages 994-95), he adopted the 
blowtorch as his tool and metal as his medium, which he used 
throughout his career. He was friendly with the Abstract 
Expressionist painters, and even after moving to a farm in 
Boltons Landing in upstate New York in 1940, he periodically 
came to the city for long periods and socialized with them in 
Greenwich Village. 

Smith was steeped in the Existentialist philosophy of his circle, 
and, like his colleagues, he dedicated his work to expressing his 
physical and psychological being. His career follows a path similar 
to Rothko s, moving from Surrealist sculptures that were basically 
drawings of organic forms in space, suggestive of Miro, to totally 


abstract iconic forms. Beginning in the mid-1940s, Smith con¬ 
structed his sculptures from large reserves of metal that he always 
had on hand, working not so much from preliminary sketches and 
preconceived notions of a finished product but, like de Kooning 
and Pollock, by a continuous chain of reactions to each gesture, 
which in his case would be made in a welded material. Despite his 
working method, which allowed him to work and think in the 
round, he generally conceived his sculptures like paintings, to be 
seen almost two-dimensionally from a single viewpoint. 

An example of Smith s late, iconic style is the Cubi series (fig. 
29.5), begun in 1961 and consisting of 18 works. Because of its 
severe geometry, the Cubi series is unusual for Smith. He did not 
have equipment to cut stainless steel, and consequently was 
forced to order it from the manufacturer in precut rectangular 
shapes, which he assembled into boxes of different sizes that he 
welded together based on intuition and personal emotion. Despite 
their relentless geometry, these enormous sculptures are hardly 
mechanical and unemotional. They are both anthropomorphic 
and totemic, evoking giant figures and ritualistic structures. They 
have the sublime presence of a prehistoric monument and 
embrace a powerful spirituality. It is as though the elemental 
forms, placed on a tabletop altar, are the very building blocks of 
the universe itself, their sense of movement and solidity reflecting 
the essence of life, their precarious arrangement the inevitable 
impermanence of all things. Smith ended by burnishing the steel, 
giving it a textured finish. And because we can feel his touch here, 
the work takes on a surprising organic quality.

Smiths work became dramatically larger in the 1950s, influ¬ 
enced, in part, by the scale of Abstract Expressionist painting. 
Another Surrealist sculptor followed suit: Louise Nevelson 
(1900-1988), who emerged in the 1940s. By the 1950s, she was 
working with fragments of black-painted wood assembled in 
mysterious black boxes, and by the end of the decade, she began 
making enormous walls of these boxes. 

One of these is Sky Cathedral—Moon Garden Plus One (fig. 
29.6), produced from 1957 to 1960. In it, fragments of furniture 
and architecture become provocative Surrealist objects in a poetic 
dreamlike setting. We sense we are looking at the flotsam and jet¬ 
sam of civilization, the fragments of people s lives, of people long 
gone. But as the title suggests, Nevelson s forms also evoke land¬ 
scape and the cosmos, the round shapes suggesting the planets and 
moons, the splintered wood the mountains, and the accumulation 
of boards the rock formations. Nevelson wanted her black works 
(others are all gold or white) illuminated by a blue light, which 
would suggest twilight, the moment of transformation, when 
things begin to look different and to change into something else, 
swallowed up by unseen mystical forces. 

EXISTENTIALISM IN EUROPE: 

FIGURAL EXPRESSIONISM 

Abstract Expressionism was identified with the United States, 
which in the late 1950s began exporting the work to Europe in 
exhibitions sponsored by the federal government. These shows, 
ostensibly for the sake of good international public relations, 


strutted the country’s artistic superiority and virility, and comple¬ 
mented its military, financial, and technological dominance. They 
were cultural pawns in the Cold War. While Europeans developed 
a counterpart to Abstract Expressionism, perhaps the best-known 
Existentialist painting was figurative. Two especially powerful 
artists were Jean Dubuffet and Francis Bacon. Both were loners, 
with no group or movement affiliations, and artistically kept to 
themselves, independently developing their own responses to the 
existential loneliness of human existence. 

Jean Dubufjet 

As a young man, the Frenchman Jean Dubuffet (1901-1985) was 
an unlikely candidate for artistic fame. Until the early 1940s, his 
commitment to, and even his belief in, art was intermittent, and he 
often worked for a family wine business. Many of his attitudes 
paralleled Dada: He was antiart and antibourgeois. What inter¬ 
ested him most was finding a way to see beyond the blinders of 
civilization, with its limited concepts of beauty and reality. As had 
Kandinsky, Malevich, and Mondrian before him, Dubuffet sought 
to reveal higher truths, namely the interconnectedness of all 
things in the universe. 

Critical to Dubuffet s development was his discovery in the 
early 1940s of the art of the untrained and insane, which he called 
Art Brut (literally, “Raw Art”) and collected. He felt artists 
untouched by conventional training were uninhibited by the 
superego and expressed primal urges and desires that were 
directly connected to mystical forces. Graffiti, children s art— 
anything equally unrestrained and spontaneously produced—fell

into this same category. Dubuffet adopted these direct untutored 
styles in his own art because he believed they represented a uni¬ 
versal language that anyone could understand and appreciate. 

The second major ingredient in Dubuffet s worldview is the 
concept that all things are equally consecrated because everything 
is composed of the same matter and energy. We can see this virtu¬ 
ally illustrated in Le Metafisyx (fig. 29.7), painted in 1950 in his 
Art Brut style. Here, he literally etches his woman into a deep bed 
of paint, which is crude and rough, suggesting earth, ancient 
plaster walls, and stone. Not only is this comic-repulsive, soil- 
encrusted woman identified with mineral matter, she is also time¬ 
less, for she resembles an archaeological find excavated from a 
remote prehistoric site. The frenetic graffitilike style is so abstract, 
we can read the figure in endless ways and even see the scratchy 
wiry lines as representing an unseen energy that courses through 
all things. There is even the suggestion of the body dissolving 
back into elemental matter. Le Metafisyx is part of a series called 
Corp de Dames (Women's Bodies ), which in its crude drawing and 
grating texture was meant to shock, challenging the art world s 
conventional notions of beauty and art. 


Francis Bacon 

Across the English Channel in London, Francis Bacon 
(1909-1992), a second loner, was stirring up the art world by 
expressing his own existential angst. One look at his Head 
Surrounded by Sides ofBeef( fig. 29.8) of 1954 and we realize we 
are in the presence of one of the more frightening images of the 
twentieth century Bacon emerged as a force on the London art 
scene right after World War II, and it is tempting to view his hor¬ 
rific pictures as a statement about the senseless savagery he had 
just witnessed. But Bacon s themes were already in place well 
before the war, and presumably they stem largely from his own 
horrible circumstances, which included abuse as a child and an 
adult life dominated by the classic vices of alcohol, gambling, and 
promiscuous sex. 

We cannot be sure that these experiences account for Bacon s 
work, for unlike Dubuffet and the Abstract Expressionists, for 
example, Bacon did not pontificate about art, issue manifestos, or 
declare that painting had to fill social voids. Like his Existentialist 
contemporaries, he painted from the gut, claiming that when he 
started a picture he had no idea where he would end up. His first 
painting based on Velazquez s Pop Innocent X (there are 45 ver¬ 
sions), which is the source for the central figure in Head

Surrounded by Sides of Beef, supposedly began as a garden scene. 
Our painting not only refers to the Velazquez portrait, but also to 
a contemporary photograph of Pope Pius XII (whose bespecta¬ 
cled head we see), a Rembrandt painting of a flayed ox, and a still 
of a nurse screaming in the 1925 classic silent film Battleship 
Potemkin by Sergei Eisenstein (1898-1948). In most of Bacons 
paintings based on Velazquez’s Pope Innocent X , the focal point is 
the primal scream of the sitter, the wide dark pit of the opened 
mouth. In our figure, however, this motif is not nearly as promi¬ 
nent, as it is balanced by the crucified slab of beef that frames the 
sitter. Add the black void, the claustrophobic compression of the 
glass cage, and the gritty quality of sections of the paint surface, 
and we have a house of horror, obviously the chamber of the 
artist’s grim psyche. A viewer cannot get back from the scene, 
which seems thrown in ones face by the bold brushwork that 
prominently sits on the surface of the canvas, pulling the image 
along with it and toward us. Bacon said of his paintings, “You 
can’t be more horrific than life itself. ” 


REJECTING ABSTRACT 
EXPRESSIONISM: AMERICAN ART OF 
THE 1 950s AND 1 960s 

By the mid-1950s other styles were already beginning to 
overshadow Abstract Expressionism. The 1950s planted the seeds 
of a cultural revolution, producing a thirst for freedom of 
expression that required the invention of radically new art forms. 
Combines, environments, Happenings, Minimal Art, and 
Conceptual Art took art into uncharted territory, breaking down 
the barriers that had previously narrowly restricted art to certain 
standard mediums. 


Re-Presenting Life and Dissecting Painting 

No one person or event triggered the dramatic change that 
occurred in art in the 1950s, but artist Robert Rauschenberg and 
musical composer John Cage certainly played major roles. 
Rauschenberg probably spoke for many when he explained why 
he rejected Abstract Expressionism: “It was all about suffering 
and self-expression and the State of Things. I just wasn’t inter¬ 
ested in that, and I certainly did not have any interest in trying 
to improve the world through painting.” Jasper Johns, 
Rauschenberg’s close friend at the time, similarly rejected 
Abstract Expressionism. While both artists made paintings that 
had the gestural mark making of the Abstract Expressionists, 
these works were an intellectual, impersonal analysis of art rather 
than an explosion of feelings and primal urges. 

ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG AND JOHN CAGE Robert 
Rauschenberg (1925-2008) was a Texan from a working-class fam¬ 
ily who ended up in New York studying painting by 1947. A crit¬ 
ical component of his development was attending the avant-garde

Black Mountain College in North Carolina in the fall of 1948, and 
again in 1951 and 1952. The painting department at the small lib¬ 
eral arts school was headed by Josef Albers (1888-1976), who, 
with his wife, Anni (1899-1994), had taught at the Bauhaus, in 
Germany (see pages 1007-10). Rauschenberg did not care for 
Albers as a teacher, but the institution encouraged experimenta¬ 
tion, which turned Rauschenberg away from pure painting, 
toward an analysis of the very concept of art. At Black Mountain 
in 1951, he made a series of White Paintings , which he exhibited at 
the Stable Gallery in New York in 1953. These were large can¬ 
vases painted a solid white, with no evidence of brushwork. 
Viewers wondered what they were supposed to see. Themselves, 
for one thing. Their shadows were cast on the canvases, which 
also caught reflected colored light and accumulated dust and dirt. 
These canvases captured real life, which was presented without 
comment or meaning. Viewers could read anything into them 
that they wanted. Like Duchamp, Rauschenberg was making 
Conceptual Art, determined by chance, and aimed at capturing 
the world without attaching any firm meaning in that process. In 
their objective neutrality, these extraordinary paintings were the 
antithesis of the intensely personal Abstract Expressionism, 
which ruled the day. 

One of the people who thoroughly understood the White 
Paintings was John Cage (1912-1992), an avant-garde composer 
who was garnering a reputation for his works for altered piano, a 
piano with objects placed under the strings to change their sound. 
In response to the White Paintings , Cage wrote 4' 33" , a piano 
piece first performed in Woodstock, New York, in 1952. The 
work was “played” by a pianist who sat down and opened the 
keyboard and did nothing else for 4 minutes and 33 seconds. 
During this time the audience listened to the sounds of the real 
world: the shuffling, coughing, and whispering in the recital hall 
and the sounds of falling rain and chirping birds coming in 
through an open window. The last sound was the keyboard case 
being shut, signaling the end of the piece. 

These and many other conceptual works from this period 
were designed to remove the artist from the work of art as well as 
to ask such questions as: What is art? How does it function? 
Rauschenberg picked up where Duchamp had left off. His art, 
however, is never meant to shock or destroy, and his attitude 
and approach are always positive. He is a presenter, not a nihilist. 
He is a collector of life, which he gathers up and energetically 
presents for us to think about and interpret for ourselves. 
Furthermore, he was not interested in painting life, but in re¬ 
presenting it. “I don’t want a picture to look like something it 
isn’t. I want it to look like something it is. And I think a picture 
is more like the real world when it’s made out of the real world. ” 

In 1955, Rauschenberg incorporated the real world into his art 
when he began making combines, innovative works that com¬ 
bined painting, sculpture, collage, and found objects, as in his 
Odalisk (fig. 29.9) of 1955-58. This four-sided “lamp”—there is 
an electric light inside—is crowded with collaged material culled 
from contemporary magazines and newspapers as well as detritus 
from the street and from thrift shops. Even the title is part of this 


busy collage, for it has to be considered when we try to construct 
a narrative for the work. But is there a narrative in this poetic 
collage of disparate materials? Obviously, Odalisk has a subject, 
for it is filled with sexual innuendo: the phallic pole jammed into 
the pillow on the bottom, the stuffed cock mounted above the 
nude pinup with a dog howling at her from below, the comic strip 
of a woman in bed being surprised by a man (on a side of the 
sculpture not pictured here). Even the title, which is a pun on the 
female odalisque (see fig. 24.13) and phallic obelisk (a tall, tapering 
stone monument), can be interpreted sexually. But the artist 
places no value on materials, suggests no interpretation, makes no 
grand statement. The work just is. It is our materials, our time, 
our life. Rauschenberg re-presents it with extraordinary formal 
powers and with a poetry of paint and collage. In its energy and 
fragmentation, the work powerfully captures the spirit of the con¬ 
stantly changing world and the fractured way we experience it. 

JASPER JOHNS In 1954, Rauschenberg met Jasper Johns (b. 
1930) and moved into a loft in the same run-down building in 
lower Manhattan. Although Johns incorporated objects into his 
paintings before Rauschenberg made his combines, he is primarily 
a painter, and his works are literally about painting. This can be 
seen in Three Flags , a work of 1958 (fig. 29.10). Because of the 
Americana theme, many writers talk about this painting as Pop 
Art, a style that in New York emerges in the early 1960s and 
derives its imagery from popular culture. American pride surged 
in the postwar period as the United States emerged as the most 
powerful and wealthiest nation in the world. More than ever 
before, images of the flag were everywhere and an integral part of 
vernacular culture. Three Flags , however, is not about popular 
culture, for it is part of series in which the artist repeatedly 
painted flat objects, such as numbers, targets, and maps, with the 
intention of eliminating the need to paint illusionistic depth. 
Here, he has painted a flat object (a flag) on a flat surface (the can¬ 
vas), so we are not tempted to read, for example, a white star as 
sitting on top of a blue field because we know it does not. 
Furthermore, Johns does not place the flag in any context that 
allows us to read specific meaning or emotion into it. The flag is a 
sign to which Johns has attached no specific meaning or emotion. 
In other words, Johns has created a nonillusionistic, impersonal 
image. What we are left to look at is how the picture was made. 
Johns’s very beautiful and methodical application of wax-based 
encaustic paint reminds us that a painting consists of paint on can¬ 
vas. And, of course, painting can be about color, here red, white, 
and blue. Lest we forget that a painting is a three-dimensional 
object, Johns has stacked three flag paintings one atop another. 
We see their sides and hence their depth. Lastly, Johns reminds 
us that painting can produce an image. However, he does not 
give us an illusionistic image; we would never mistake Johns’s flag 
for a real flag. As such, Johns tells us an image is a sign, that 
painting is an abstract language, just like verbal language. Just as a 
word is a sign, standing for something else, so too is painting; it 
signifies something else, just as numbers and maps are signs for 
something else.

While the intellectual gymnastics in Johns s paintings are com¬ 
plex and rigorous, the works themselves are objective, devoid of 
any emotion. Like Rauschenberg, Johns paved a way for artists to 
break away from the subjectivity and vocabulary of Abstract 
Expressionism. His powerful assertion of the properties of paint¬ 
ing and its inherent flatness would inspire numerous artists in the 
following decades. 

Environments and Performance Art 

Rauschenbergs combines played a major role in setting off a 
chain reaction that caused an explosion of art making that entirely 
redefined art. Art was no longer just painting, sculpture, and 
work on paper; now, it took on the form of limitless mediums and 
moved out of galleries and museums into the real world, some¬ 
times interacting with daily life, other times taking place in such 
faraway locations that few people ever got to see it. Art was often 
no longer an object; rather it could be temporary and ephemeral, 
something that could not be bought and sold. 

ALLAN KAPROW In 1956, months after Pollock s death in a car 
crash, Allan Kaprow (1927-2006), a painter teaching at Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, published an article in 
Art News entitled “The Legacy of Jackson Pollock. ” He described 
how Pollock s action paintings, often because of their scale and 
the fact that some contained real objects, had started to become 
environmental. The next step, he claimed, was to make environ¬ 
mental art: “Pollock, as I see him, left us at the point where we 
must become preoccupied with and even dazzled by the space and 
objects of our everyday life, either our bodies, clothes, rooms, or, 


if need be, the vastness of Forty-second Street.” Kaprow knew 
Rauschenberg s work (he was awed by the White Paintings ), and 
this pronouncement about incorporating everyday life into art 
sounds like a description of the Texan s combines. 

In 1958, Kaprow began to make what he called environments, 
constructed installations that a viewer can enter. His most famous 
environment, Yard (fig. 29.11), came in 1961. Filled mostly with 
used tires, the work had the allover look and energy of a Pollock 
painting, but visitors to the town-house garden where it was 
installed were expected to walk through it, experiencing it physi¬ 
cally, including its smell. Like Rauschenberg in his combines, 
Kaprow attached no firm meaning to his works, although the 
discarded synthetic materials suggest a modern industrial urban 
environment, as well as a sense of waste, even death. 

To learn how to add sound to his environments, Kaprow sat 
in on John Cage s music composition course at the New School 
for Social Research, a class filled with artists—not musicians— 
almost all of whom went on to become famous. Music was made 
by chance and generally without traditional instruments. A typi¬ 
cal exercise would be to compose a piece with radios and use a 
method governed by chance, such as the I-Ching, an ancient 
Chinese system of divination based on random number-genera¬ 
tion procedures, to determine when and by whom each radio 
would be turned on and off and the length of the piece. 

The class inspired Kaprow to add the live human figure to his 
environments, which, unlike Yard , initially were made of a variety 
of collaged nonart materials that ran from floor to ceiling, vaguely 
resembling a Rauschenberg combine. He unveiled the result to 
the New York art world in 1959 at the Reuben Gallery as 18 
FFappenings in 6 Parts. Using polyfilm walls, Kaprow divided his

collaged environment into three rooms, in which seated specta¬ 
tors watched, listened, and smelled as performers carried out such 
tasks as painting (Rauschenberg and Johns participated), playing 
records, squeezing orange juice, and speaking fragments of sen¬ 
tences, all determined by chance. In a sense, the work was like a 
Rauschenberg combine that took place in time and space and with 
human activity. Because of the title of Kaprow s innovative work, 
a Happening became the term for this new visual art form, in 
which many of the major artists of the day, including 
Rauschenberg, started working. While many artists accepted this 
term, others used different labels, all of which can be grouped 
under the umbrella term Performance Art, which is distinguished 
from theater in that it takes place in an art context. 

ROBERT WHITMAN 18 Happenings unleashed a flurry of 
Happenings, or Performance Art, which lasted through the 
mid-1960s. Soon-to-be-famous artists like Claes Oldenburg, Jim 
Dine, Robert Morris, and Red Grooms along with Rauschenberg 
created works. The artist who has dedicated his life to the 


genre, which he prefers to call Theater Pieces, is Robert Whitman 
(b. 1935), a student of Kaprow s at Rutgers and also another 
vagabond in Cage s famous New School composition class. In 
1960, he presented American Moon at the Reuben Gallery The set 
was made up largely of paper, cardboard and polyfilm, yet these 
banal materials were leant a poetic beauty by the strange, non¬ 
narrative actions of the performers, which occurred at a lyrical 
pace. All of these elements—common materials, poetic imagery, 
and lyrical pacing—would characterize his work, defying inter¬ 
pretation while evoking a broad range of responses. (To view the 
performance and a documentary film on this and other Theater 
Pieces, see www.myartslab.com. ) If Kaprow s performance pieces 
were prosaic, mundane, and very down-to-earth, Whitman s were 
abstract and dreamlike, garnering him a reputation with art histo¬ 
rians as the master of the medium and one of its most innovative 
practitioners. Whitman thought of his Theater Pieces as one con¬ 
tinuous image that unfolds in space and time. Abandoning words, 
he took the most mundane objects, such as a candle, piece of fruit, 
or lightbulb, and over time, using light, color, movement, and 
pacing, transformed it into something magical and mysterious. 
An especially radical feature of American Moon was film projec¬ 
tion, which he used in many of his performances, as seen in Prune 
Flat (fig. 29.12) of 1965, where film, shadow, and the real-life 
performers are hauntingly juxtaposed, creating multiple layers of 
imagery and an oneiric sense of mystery Whitman s use of film, 
which he also used in 1964 installations he called Cinema Pieces, 
were made before the advent of video, and anticipated the Video 
Art and installations of later decades. 

GEORGE BRECHT Also in John Cages class with Kaprow in 
1958 was another unregistered student, George Brecht 
(1926-2009), who for a class assignment wrote a composition for 
automobiles entitled Motor Vehicle Sunset Event. For this work, 
participants drew cards with instructions and at sundown in a city 
parking lot they revved engines, honked horns, rolled down win¬ 
dows, slammed doors shut, and opened and closed hoods and 
trunks. Brecht began typing up this and other Events, as he called

these compositions, on white cards and mailing them to acquain¬ 
tances, an act that initiated an art form that came to be called Mail 
Art. (Brecht s good friend, Rutgers University art teacher Robert 
Watts, began designing art stamps to mail their Event cards, thus 
inventing Stamp Art.) 

By 1960, Brechts Events had become quite minimal. Three 
Aqueous Events , printed on a roughly 2-by-3-inch card, consisted 
of the title and under it three bulleted words: “water,” “ice,” and 
“steam” People receiving the card in the mail could respond in 
any way they wanted—they could even frame the card. Allan 
Kaprow, for example, thought of making iced tea. What is the 
work of art in Three Aqueous Events ? The idea? The card itself? 
The execution of the piece? And who is actually the artist in this 
work that allows the recipient to be the creator? Brecht was 
posing the classic Duchampian questions while simultaneously 
integrating art into daily life and taking it off the aesthetic and 
intellectual pedestal reserved for high art. By 1962, Brecht s exam¬ 
ple had helped spawn a New York-based international art move¬ 
ment called Fluxus, similarly dedicated to making a conceptual art 
that violated the conventional distinctions between art and life, 
artist and nonartist, museum and street, and which included 
Performance Art as a major component. One of the group s most 
famous works is Brechts Drip Music (1959J, which was executed 
by having the performer mount a stepladder and pour water at 
varying rates and intervals into a bowl on the floor. 

GEORGE SEGAL Living down the road from Kaprow in rural 
New Jersey was George Segal (1924-2000), who responded to his 
friend s environments and Happenings by creating representational, 


not abstract, environments out of real objects and populated by 
plaster figures, as in The Gas Station (fig. 29.13) of 1963. Now, the 
performers are frozen, reduced to ghost-white mannequins. To 
create them, Segal used real people, making castings of them by 
using plaster medical bandages. Like Rauschenberg and Kaprow, 
he was breaking down the barrier between art and life. But his art 
is far from neutral; it is emotional and makes a statement. Segal s 
work highlights the alienation he perceived in contemporary life. 
This alienation can be seen in his figures, which are left white, as 
though drained of life. Generally they are lethargic, exhausted, 
and alone, and seem trapped by a harsh geometry of the horizon¬ 
tals and verticals of their setting. 

The works even contain symbols used in more traditional art. 
Gas Station , for example, is dominated by a Bulova clock, a 
memento mori (“reminder of death”) motif, which floats in a 10- 
foot expanse of darkness. Its shape mysteriously resonates with 
the tire on the floor. The vending machine, tires, cans of high- 
performance oil, and the gas station itself suggest modernity, tech¬ 
nology, and fast, efficient living. Missing from this materiality, 
however, is something meaningful—human interaction and spiri¬ 
tuality. Segal retains the existential angst of his Abstract 
Expressionist background by questioning the meaning of modern 
existence. Although he often used contemporary branded objects, 
such as Coke bottles, to give his environments the look of reality 
and modernity, Segal never celebrated the products of consumer 
culture, nor questioned how mass-media imagery, including 
advertising, manipulates its audience. His sculpture is closer in 
spirit and style to the paintings of Edward Hopper (see fig. 28.53) 
than to Pop Art, with which he has been mistakenly associated.

Pop Art: Consumer Culture as Subject 

Pop Art is a style that emerged in New York in the early 1960s, 
although it had appeared in a very different guise and with 
less fanfare in Britain a decade earlier—this incarnation had no 
impact on the development of American Pop. The style got its 
name because it derives its imagery from popular or vernacular 
culture. Like Rauschenberg and Kaprow, Pop artists re-presented 
the artifacts of the world they lived in, namely the imagery of 
the mass media, although they did it using conventional painting 
rather than new mediums. Unlike Johns and Segal, both of 
whom occasionally used popular imagery, Pop artists focused on 
the products of popular culture by taking what art historians 
often describe as a low art form, that is commercial art, and 
incorporating it into one that is considered high , meaning fine 
art. By doing so, however, they subversively revealed the manip¬ 
ulative impact of the mass media. Among the best-known Pop 
artists are the Americans Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol, 
as well as the British collagist and painter Richard Hamilton. 
Although not labeled a Pop artist, the German Sigmar Polke sim¬ 
ilarly appropriated imagery from mass culture as he not only 
critiqued that culture but also explored the meaning and language 
of art. 

ROY LICHTENSTEIN Another close friend of Kaprow s was 
Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997), who was hired in 1960 to teach 
painting at Rutgers University. When he arrived he was an 
Abstract Expressionist painter. Within a year, however, he was 
making what would be considered Pop paintings, in part influ¬ 
enced by Kaprow s dictum to make art that did not look like art. 
(See Primary Source, page 1050.) 

The contemporary life that Lichtenstein scavenged and re¬ 
presented was not the urban streets, as was the case with Kaprow, 
Rauschenberg, and Segal, but the crude black-and-white adver¬ 
tisements in telephone books and newspapers and the prosaic 
drawings in comic books. These he cropped and adjusted into 
visually riveting images, such as Drowning Girl (fig. 29.14). 
Traditionally, Lichtenstein is appreciated for seeing the beauty of 
"low art” and elevating it to “high art,” in effect celebrating 
popular culture, and in particular American culture. When first 
shown, however, his paintings were so radical they were thought 
hideous and were not even considered art by many. After all, 
they looked like images from comic books. Furthermore, art, 
and particularly Modernist art, was supposed to move art for¬ 
ward, investigating new aspects of abstraction. High art was not 
supposed to look like low art, and it was not supposed to be 
representational. 

Lichtenstein s work does more than just blur the distinctions 
between fine art and mass culture. Like Johns, whose Flag paint¬ 
ings had a profound impact on him, Lichtenstein was interested in 
the language of art, particularly in regard to issues of perception. 
He does not just imitate the comic strip, he also plays with that 
genre s technique of making an image out of benday dots, the 
small dots that when massed together create color and shading in

printed material. He was intrigued by how an illusion of three- 
dimensional volume could be made using flat dots and flat black 
lines. When viewed from close up, Lichtenstein s large images 
dissolve into flat abstract patterns, virtually becoming Abstract 
Expressionist compositions. 

Lichtenstein did not randomly select his sources or select 
them just for aesthetic purposes, for the images that he used for 
his paintings from 1961 to 1964 tend to fall into a distinct pattern: 
Men are portrayed as strong, virile soldiers and fighter pilots, 
whereas women are shown as emotionally distraught, dependent 
on men, and happily slaving around the house doing domestic 
chores. With deadpan brilliance, Lichtenstein made his paintings 
a mirror of contemporary society, revealing the stereotyping 
deeply embedded in the media. But the paintings themselves 
appear objective and unemotional, giving little suggestion of a 
polemical agenda or a sense of the artist s presence, whether his 
hand (brushwork) or emotions. 

ANDY WARHOL Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was making art 
based on comic books at exactly the same time as Lichtenstein. 
When the dealer Leo Castelli decided to represent Lichtenstein 
and not him, Warhol turned to other kinds of popular imagery, 
namely product design and newspaper photographs. Warhol was 
from Pittsburgh, and in the 1950s in New York he established 
himself as a successful illustrator of womens shoes, learning first

OURCE 


Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997) 



From an interview with Joan Marter 

In this 1996 interview with the art historian Joan Marter, Roy Lichtenstein 
talks about the enormous impact Allan Kaprow’s environments and New 
York happenings had on the development of his Pop Art. 





JOAN MARTER: In one of your interviews, you say that “although I 
feel that what I am doing almost has nothing to do with 
Environments, there is a kernel of thought in Happenings that is 
interesting to me. ” Can you comment? 

ROY LICHTENSTEIN: Well, there’s more than a kernel of thought in 
Happenings that is interesting to me. ... Many of them tended to 
have American objects rather than School of Paris objects. I’m 
thinking of the tires, and the kind of advertising sort of things in 
[Claes] Oldenburg’s and [Jim] Dines Happenings. They were like 
an American street, maybe from Pollock in a certain way. The 
Environments are like expanded Pollocks; they are allover in the 
same kind of sense. If I look at Pollock now, I think they’re really 
beautiful; I don’t get all of the gutsy stuff—the cigarette butts and 
house paint, and everything they’re made out of. They had a big 


influence on Happenings. Because the Environment would 
envelop you the way that we thought that Pollock’s paintings 
enveloped you—they were big and seemed to have no end. They 
were allover, all of that. Some of that, I think, went into 
Environments, which were kind of a background for Happenings. 
... But the thing that probably had the most influence on me was 
the American rather than the French objects. 

JM: Do you remember anything specifically [about Allan Kaprow’s 
work] that interested you? 

RL: The tires he did [Yard at the Martha Jackson Gallery, 1961; see 
fig. 29.11]. Also other things with strips of paper and things writ¬ 
ten on them [Words, at the Smolin Gallery, 1962]. I think the thing 
I most got from him was this kind of statement about it doesn’t 
have to look like art, or how much of what you do is there only 
because it looks like art. You always thought artists should be 
original, whatever it was. I was doing Abstract Expressionism very 
late, 1961, and much of that was because it looked like art to me. ... 
I was amazed at how much he [Kaprow] actually liked [my Look 
Mickey and the other first Pop paintings]. Most people hated it 
at first.

hand the deceiving and manipulative role of advertising and prod¬ 
uct packaging. He was also fascinated by the impact of the mass 
media on public opinion. Among his most famous works and 
among the first he made after abandoning cartoon imagery is the 
first that he mass-produced, Campbell's Soup Cans (fig. 29.15). He 


painted 32 Campbell’s soup can images for his first exhibition, in 
1962, at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, which at the time had 
a burgeoning contemporary art scene. The Campbell company 
then offered 32 varieties of canned soup, hence 32 paintings, 
which Warhol hand-painted. Warhol installed the works as

monotonously as possible, evenly spacing them and placing them 
on a shelf, as soup cans would be presented in a supermarket. (In 
our illustration, the works, some later and silkscreened, are 
arranged in a grid.) Just as the soup came off a mass-production 
assembly line, Warhol, soon after his Ferus Gallery exhibition, 
began mass-producing his paintings in his studio, which he called 
“the Factory.” Assistants made the works to his specifications, 
using a silkscreen process to print a photographic image of a soup 
can onto canvas, or onto paper, as he did to make prints. (For a 
more extensive discussion of this process as well as of his portrait 
of Marilyn Monroe, see the Introduction, pages xxi and xxvi.) 
Although a workaholic and highly involved with the production 
of his art, Warhol gave the public the illusion that he barely 
touched his own paintings and prints, just signing them on the 
back. With this Duchampian gesture, Warhol tells us that paint¬ 
ings are commodities, that people are buying a name product— 
that is, a Warhol—and that art is about ideas, not necessarily 
about technique or craftsmanship. 

But Warhol is also commenting on the camouflaging function of 
product design, how it tells us nothing about the mass-produced 
product it promotes and how the packaging lures us into buying 
it. Warhol s art underscores how Campbell s soup is everywhere, 
having penetrated the farthest reaches of the country, and that 
mass production, uniformity, and consumerism dominate American 
society. In effect, his Soup Cans are a portrait of America. Like 
Lichtenstein, Warhol neither praises nor condemns. 

BRITISH POP While Pop Art emerged in America in the early 
1960s, it had already appeared in London in the mid-1950s. 
Protesting the conservatism of the Institute of Contemporary 
Arts, which largely promoted prewar painters and sculptors, a 
handful of artists formed the Independent Group, dedicated to 
bringing contemporary life into contemporary art. The war had 
left Britain commercially weak and with few creature comforts. 
Thus, the British were more than ready to appreciate the celebrity 
promotion and advertisements for appliances, cars, and homes 
that they found in the American magazines that flooded London. 
Well before their American counterparts, the British were fasci¬ 
nated by the technology and consumerism they saw taking over 
American society. The Independent Group, led by artists Richard 
Hamilton (b. 1922) and Eduardo Paolozzi (1924-2005) and critic 
Lawrence Alio way (1926-1990), embraced American mass cul¬ 
ture and celebrated it in their art. 

Using the photomontage technique developed by the Berlin 
Dadaists (see page 988), Richard Hamilton cut images from comic 
books and body-building and pinup magazines, as seen in his Just 
What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealingf 
(fig. 29.16) of 1956. Sprinkled around the room depicted in this 
small collage are the latest hi-tech commodities: a tape recorder, 
television, and Space Age vacuum cleaner. A Ford logo decorates 
a lampshade, while a can of ham sits on a coffee table as though it 
were a sculpture. The weightlifter carries a lollipop inscribed with 
the word “pop,” a term coined by Alio way, announcing that this 
is Pop Art. Sex permeates the image as Hamilton exposes, and 


perhaps even celebrates, the powerful role sexual innuendo plays 
in advertising. 

THE IMPACT OF POP ART IN GERMANY During the 1960s 
and 1970s, the art world was focused so heavily on New York that 
other art centers, especially those in Europe, were all but ignored. 
Artists in Dusseldorf were producing some of the most important 
work of the period, yet only Joseph Beuys, whom we shall meet 
later in this chapter, was well known internationally. It was not 
until the mid-1980s that the New York art world discovered 
Sigmar Polke (b. 1941) and Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), two East 
German transplants, who toward 1963 cultivated a kind of 
German Pop Art. 

Polke and Richter were heavily influenced by the combines of 
Robert Rauschenberg and by Pop Art, especially the works of Roy 
Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, which they knew from magazines. 
They were also well versed in the Dada antiart movement, since 
the first postwar Dada exhibition took place in Dusseldorf in 1958, 
and they were mesmerized by Fluxus, the group that like Dada 
rejected high art and was dedicated to transforming life into art. 
Fluxus literally came to Dusseldorf in 1963 when the group pre¬ 
sented a festival of performances, Festum Fluxorum. Combined 
with these artistic forces was the impact of the “economic miracle” 
of the Marshall Plan (European Recovery Program) in Germany,

which by 1963 brought about a stable economy and a degree of 
consumerism. As a result, Polke and Richter, to varying degrees, 
were preoccupied with mass-media imagery, commodity culture, 
and analyzing art, revealing how it functions and takes on mean¬ 
ing. For a brief period they called their art “Capitalist Realism,” a 
pun on Socialist Realism, the official representational propaganda 


art of East Germany and the rest of the Soviet Union. Richter, in 
his paintings, largely focused on appropriating photographs, both 
mass-media and family, using a blurry presentation to undermine 
the reality of the image and turn it into a fictitious haze, thus 
revealing the artifice of painting and suggesting the ambiguity of 
the meaning of the original photograph. 


1052 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 



Polke s work was more varied at this time; throughout his 
career, the look of his work and the issues he has dealt with have 
changed constantly. In the 1960s, he made countless drawings, 
often based on images in magazines and advertising, showing 
common products. He used a range of styles, such as a slick dead¬ 
ened illustrational look and a crude cartoony style. He also often 
used nonart materials, such as blue ballpoint pen on notebook 
paper. These works were a rejection of the refinement of the high- 
art tradition, and at the same time they were quite cynical, not 
only toward artistic values but also the mass media and how it 
transformed commercial products into appealing objects: The 
objects in Polke s drawings weren’t appealing. Polke also made 
drawings and paintings using Raster dots, the small dots used in 
commercial printing. He blew up the original magazine photo¬ 
graph so large the image became a fascinating grid of dots. In a 
1966 painting entitled Bunnies a re-presentation of a magazine 
photograph of bunnygirls at a Playboy club (here the commodity 
is sex), the original image became a pixilated blur, the bunnies 
reduced to vibrating dots of different shades of black and gray and 
just barely visible. In Bunnies , Polke exposes the artificiality of 
image making, revealing how the original magazine photo was not 
reality but just an image consisting of dots. 

Before the decade was out, Polke was creating art on a wide 
range of surfaces and with a wide range of materials, as suggested 
by Alice in Wonderland (fig. 29.17) of 1971, which is paint printed 
on store-bought printed fabric, not canvas. One fabric is covered 
with soccer players and the other with polka dots, the latter a 
visual pun on the artist s name but also a reference to his use of 
Raster dots, and thus the media. Like Warhol, Polke printed 
appropriated images on his fabric—a ghost-white image of a 
basketball player, pirated from a magazine, and the caterpillar 
with a hookah and Alice biting into a mushroom, taken from the 
illustrations by Sir John Tenniel for Lewis Carols 1865 Alice in 
Wonderland. Difficult to see in reproductions are the appropri¬ 
ated 1950s-style outlines of the heads of a man and woman, hand- 
stamped several times in red and yellow. Polke bombards us with 
a variety of pilfered images, images executed in a range of styles 
and from many different periods. In effect, he is telling us that we 
both see and know the world through images, and that this picto¬ 
rial world becomes the real world, our reality. Supposedly, the 
painting was inspired by watching sports on television while 
under the influence of drugs, the theme of hallucination being 
suggested by the caterpillars hookah and Alice s mushroom. If 
this is the case, we can add portraying the experience of sensory 
perception to the long list of issues we find in this painting. 
Another issue is how context structures meaning. Polke demon¬ 
strates this by layering his motifs, for the narrative of his scav¬ 
enged images would change if they were juxtaposed differently. 
Ultimately, it is virtually impossible to attach a fixed meaning to 
Alice in Wonderland , allowing us to assume that Polke sees art, and 
images in general, as not having fixed meanings—only interpreta¬ 
tions depending on context and who is doing the interpreting. 

Ultimately, Polke and Richter did not consider their art Pop 
Art, and despite Polke re-presenting media images, as did Warhol 


and Lichtenstein, there is no mistaking his art for theirs. In his 
work, there is no sense of fun or light humor and no sense of 
celebrating low art, even if the Americans were actually being 
subversively ironic in their celebration. To the contrary, his paint¬ 
ings and drawings often have a sense of parody, or as seen in Alice 
in Wonderland , and a sense of loss or sadness, as evoked by the 
ghostlike figures, the chaos of the imagery, and the emptiness of 
the "television snow” of polka dots. Instead of seeming objective 
and unemotional, his art appears subjective and emotional. As we 
shall see in the next chapter, Polka s art, heavily influenced by Pop, 
anticipated many of the fundamental issues of Postmodernism, 
and his layering of imagery and interest in how images and art 
function and take on meaning would prove quite influential. 

FORMALIST ABSTRACTION OF 
THE 1 950s AND 1 960s 

The most influential art critic in the United States in the 1940s and 
well into the 1960s was Clement Greenberg, who wrote art 
reviews for The Nation and The Partisan Review. He began by 
championing Pollocks formalism, but as the 1940s progressed he 
increasingly promoted an art that was totally abstract and nonref- 
erential and dealt with just those qualities inherent to the medium, 
that is color, texture, shape of field, and composition. Such work, 
which emphasized the formalist or abstract qualities of the 
medium, could make no reference beyond itself. Greenbergs 
theories had an enormous impact on the way painters, sculptors, 
and other critics thought about art. His criticism helped lay a 
foundation for the Post-Painterly painting and Minimalist Art of 
the 1950s and 1960s. 

Formalist Painting 

Formalist painting emerged in the heyday of Abstract 
Expressionism, the early 1950s, and in large part as a reaction to 
it. Just as Rauschenberg, Johns, Kaprow, and the Pop artists 
rejected the subjective components of Pollock and de Kooning, 
the formalist painters sought to make unemotional art. They 
replaced bold, gestural brushwork with smooth surfaces that gave 
no hint of the artist s hand or feelings. Instead of the push-pull of 
Cubist space of de Kooning s style of Abstract Expressionism, 
they powerfully asserted the flatness of the canvas, virtually elim¬ 
inating any sense of space. Led by Greenberg, they were attracted 
to the formalist implications of Abstract Expressionism, not its 
emotional content. They also embraced the styles enormous 
scale. Among the formalist styles of the period are Post-Painterly 
Abstraction, Hard-Edge Abstraction, and Minimalism. 

HELEN FRAN KEN THALER Greenberg championed Helen 
Frankenthaler (b. 1928) as one of the new formalists. Franken- 
thaler was inspired by Jackson Pollock, who, toward 1950, in an 
attempt to expand his art beyond drip paintings, began working 
on unprimed canvases, using just black enamel paint and allowing

it to seep into the fabric, creating a smooth surface. Frankenthaler 
built on the implications of this technique. In a breakthrough 
work of 1952, Mountains and Sea (fig. 29.18), she developed stain 
painting. Frankenthaler had just returned from Nova Scotia, and 
using charcoal on unprimed canvas, she quickly laid in a compo¬ 
sition suggesting landscape. Working like Pollock, she put her 


canvas on the floor. She then poured thin oil paint on it, tilting it 
to allow the paint to run, drawing and painting by changing the 
angled tilt of the canvas rather than using a brush. The thin oil 
bled into the canvas, becoming one with it and having the translu- 
cency of watercolor. Greenberg admired the picture s flatness and 
the fact that the paint was not tactile, a three-dimensional quality

that he felt would result in the illusion of space. He declared you 
could not sense the artists hand, and thus her presence, and 
praised the pictures nonreferential “decorativeness” as opposed 
to its “expressionistic” qualities. While Pollock first used 
unprimed canvas, it was Frankenthaler’s example of thin translu¬ 
cent oils that spawned in the 1950s and 1960s legions of stain 
painters, of whom the best known are the Washington Color 
School painters. Unlike Frankenthaler, however, her followers’ 
work was entirely abstract. 

Greenberg’s personal infatuation with Frankenthaler appar¬ 
ently blinded him to the Abstract Expressionist side of her work. 
Like her many followers, she is now often labeled a Post- 
Painterly Abstractionist, a term that refers to the smooth nonges- 
tural nature of this kind of abstraction, but in the 1950s and 1960s 
she was generally considered a second-generation Abstract 
Expressionist. As the title implies, Mountains and Sea reflects her 
experience of the Nova Scotia landscape. The energy of the curv¬ 
ing, explosive composition seems to embody the sublime force 
of nature, while the soft translucent colors and white unprimed 
canvas evoke the brilliant glare of sunlight. Although essentially 
abstract, the picture is filled with references, which is generally 
true of her work up to the present day. 

ELLSWORTH KELLY In contrast, there are no references what¬ 
soever to be found in the abstraction of Ellsworth Kelly (b. 1923). 
Kelly developed a distinctly American brand of formalist painting 
in Paris from 1948 to 1954. During these years, he began to reduce 
painting to a barebones simplicity, which some critics called Hard- 
Edge Abstraction. To free his mind from earlier art, he based his 
abstractions on shapes he saw in the world around him, especially 
negative spaces, such as the opening under a bridge, a shadow, or 
a window. His paintings use just a handful of geometric shapes in 


solid primary and secondary colors to explore how forms move 
through space, how colors interact, and how “figure” relates to 
“ground,” that is, how image relates to background. Kelly gener¬ 
ally locks his figure and ground so tightly into a single unit they 
seem to coexist on the same spatial plane. 

In Red Blue Green (fig. 29.19), a 1963 work, Kelly plays a red 
rectangle and a blue curved shape off a green ground. The left side 
of the painting appears fixed, whereas the right has movement. 
When standing in front of this enormous work, which is more 
than 11 feet wide, a viewer can feel at one moment the green 
ground consuming the blue and at the next moment the blue 
plunging down into the green. In other words, the figure-ground 
relationship is reversed. But never to be forgotten is the sheer 
intensity of the color, especially as presented on such a large 
scale. Kelly’s genius is the simplicity of his gesture: He stripped 
everything else away, including any sense of himself, to make a 
painting that is about color—in this case red, blue, and green— 
and movement. 

FRANK STELLA Just as Kelly was returning from Europe, a 
young Frank Stella (b. 1936) began his studies at Princeton 
University, opting for an art education at a university rather than 
an art school, which became commonplace after the war. Within a 
year of graduating, he was in New York and the talk of the town 
because of his “Black Paintings,” included in a 1959 Museum of 
Modern Art exhibition called Sixteen Americans. These were total 
abstractions consisting of black parallel bands created by allowing 
white pinstripe lines of canvas to show through. He soon began 
working in color, as in Empress of India (fig. 29.20) of 1965, and 
on an enormous scale, here over 18 feet across. Inspired by the 
inherent flatness of Johnss Flag paintings (fig. 29.10), Stella made 
entirely flat works as well.

Frank Stella (b. 1936) 



Pratt Institute Lecture 

In 1959 , Stella gave a lecture to students at New York's Pratt Institute 
in which he discussed his paintings then being shown in the Museum of 
Modern Art's Sixteen Americans exhibition. He specifically addressed 
what he saw as one of the most pressing formalist issues facing painters 
at the time: how to make a composition that was not about the relation¬ 
ship of its parts. 

T here were two problems which had to be faced. One was 
spatial and the other methodological. In the first case, I had to 
do something about relational painting, i.e., the balancing of the 


various parts with and against each other. The obvious answer was 
symmetry—make it the same all over. The question still remained, 
though, of how to do this in depth. A symmetrical image or configu¬ 
ration placed on an open ground is not balanced out in the illusion- 
istic space. The solution I arrived at—and there are probably quite 
a few, although I know of only one other, color density—forces 
illusionistic space out of the painting at a constant rate by using a 
regulated pattern. The remaining problem was simply to find a 
method of paint application which followed and complemented the 
design solution. This was done by using the house painter s technique 
and tools.

There is no figure-ground relationship in Empress of India , 
and no push-pull of Cubist and Abstract Expressionist space. In 
fact, there is no hierarchy to the composition, which is deter¬ 
mined by the V-shape of each of the four canvases that have 
been butted together. Stella said of his work, “What you see is 
what you see.” In other words, the painting has nothing that 
you do not see—no hidden meanings, symbols, or references. 
Despite giving his work suggestive titles such as Empress of India, 
Stella wanted his canvases viewed simply as objects with an inde¬ 
pendent life of their own, free from associations. (See Primary 
Source , above.) 

Fellow artists and critics evaluated this kind of abstract art on 
its ability to invent new formalist devices (for example, Stella s 
ability to create perfectly flat, spaceless painting or the innovative 
shapes of his canvases). However, the power of such work lies in 
the sheer force of its scale and dramatic sense of movement as the 
Vs change direction to create new lines of movement. Because 
Stella used a stripped-down artistic vocabulary and often deter¬ 
mined his compositions using a geometric premise, critics often 
describe his paintings from this period as Minimal Art. 


Formalist Sculpture: Minimal Art 

A group of sculptors emerged in the early 1960s who generally 
composed their work using a mathematical or conceptual prem¬ 
ise, paralleling in sculpture what Stella was doing in painting. 
Their reliance upon geometry in this new work emphasized con¬ 
ceptual rather than emotional content, and it favored the means 
and materials of mass production. Their sculpture came to be 
known as Minimal art. Artists often avoided making the objects 
themselves, preferring to send specifications to an artisan, or more 
likely a factory, for production. Like Pop paintings, Minimal

sculpture lacks the evidence of the artist s touch that traditionally 
served as the sign of personal emotion and expression as well as 
proof of the artist s technical accomplishment. There is no sign of 
the artist at all. Furthermore, the artists used unconventional 
nonart materials to make art—Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, galva¬ 
nized steel, magnesium tiles—continuing the exploration of new 
materials that characterized so much of the art making of the late 
1950s and 1960s. Similarly, one of their concerns was to make art 
that did not look like art. Like Stella, they wanted their artworks 
to be perceived as independent objects, having no reference to 
things beyond themselves. 

DONALD JUDD The characteristics of Minimalism are appar¬ 
ent in Untitled , a 1969 sculpture of copper boxes (fig. 29.21) by 
Donald Judd (1928-1994). The sculptor determined the shape and 
spacing of the boxes by mathematical premise (each box is 9-by- 
40-by-31 inches, with 9 inches between boxes), not by intuition 
or artistic sensitivity, as David Smith, for example, operated (see 
fig. 29.5). Like Stella s paintings, Judd s work was constructed by 
serial repetition of elements so there is no hierarchy of composi¬ 
tion and no evocation of emotion. A viewer can take in and read¬ 
ily understand his composition at a glance. 

Judd described his sculpture as a “specific object,” meaning it 
was a real object that had no references beyond itself. Viewers 
were to admire it for its scale, color, texture, and proportions, for 
example. In addition to possessing the properties of a well-made 
“real thing,” Judds boxes occupy space like ordinary things as 
well. They are not presented on a base, and there is no glass case 


to protect them. By relinquishing the props that announce an 
object to be a work of art, Minimalism heightens our awareness of 
the spaces in which we view art. In other words, the space around 
the object becomes an integral part of the work and of the art 
experience. 

DAN FLAVIN The Minimalist whose work was perhaps most 
severely limited to mathematical formulas is the light sculptor 
Dan Flavin (1933-1996), renowned for working with common 
fluorescent tubes, which he used to sculpt with colored and white 
light. Flavin s tubes were store-bought and came in 2-, 4-, 6-, and 
8-foot lengths. 

Although difficult to tell from reproductions, Flavin s deceiv¬ 
ingly simple works are spectacularly beautiful, even when they 
use just white light, as in the nominal three (to William ofOckham) 
(fig. 29.22). The magical quality of the light as it radiates through 
the surrounding space is mesmerizing, even calming, often pro¬ 
jecting a Classical serenity. For some viewers, it even embodies 
spirituality. The work, however, is strictly formalist and is deter¬ 
mined by geometric premises, here a progression from one to two 
to three lights. No references are intended, despite the suggestion 
of the title, which Flavin attached upon finishing the work. 

Flavin s sculpture is often extremely simple, consisting of a 
single tube of white or colored light, sometimes placed vertically 
on the wall and sitting on the floor, other times coming off a 
corner along a wall at a 45-degree angle. With Minimalism, art 
reached “Ground Zero. ” Reduced to bare essentials, it seemed to 
have no place left to go.

THE PLURALIST 1 970S: 
POST-MINIMALISM 

The cold objectivity of Minimalism and formalist abstraction 
dominated contemporary art in the mid-1960s and into the 1970s, 
overshadowing styles that focused on subjectivity and the human 
figure. Even Pop Art seemed unemotional and machine-made. 
But as the 1960s developed, so did an interest in an art based on 
emotion, the human being, and referential and representational 
subject matter. In the midst of the Vietnam War and the civil 
rights-led social revolution that challenged the status quo, artists 
began to view formalist abstraction as an escapist indulgence. 
With Minimalism, many artists felt that the Modernist avant- 
garde had completely lost touch with society, retreating into a 
hermetic world of its own. By the mid-1960s, artists could no 
longer remain removed from their emotions and the hotly con¬ 
tested social and political issues of the day. By the late 1960s, 
American artists began to put the human component back into 
art, and many addressed the issues tearing the nation apart. The 
responses were diverse, with artists using what seems like an end¬ 
less array of mediums to deal with an endless array of issues. Now, 
many artists made art that was temporary or conceptual and could 
not be collected, in effect dematerializing the art object and 
reflecting the antimaterialist stance of the 1960s social revolution. 
(See The Art Historian's Lens , page 1059). 

Artists themselves became quite political as they attacked the 
bastions of white male art, museums and commercial galleries. 
Women, African Americans, Latinos, American Indians, and 
Asian Americans vociferously protested their exclusion from 
the art world by picketing museums and denouncing the preju¬ 
dices of those organizations. More important, they began making 
art that dealt with issues that museum curators and directors 
did not consider mainstream or valid aesthetic concerns—issues 
such as gender, ethnic and racial identity, as well as sexual 
orientation. Disenfranchised artists, like the Impressionists 100 
years earlier, began opening their own galleries to provide an 
alternative to museums. Because the pluralism of the 1970s came 
on the heels of Minimalism, and in many respects is a response to 
its hermetic aesthetics, the art from this decade is often called 
Post-Minimalism. 

Post-Minimal Sculpture: 

Geometry and Emotion 

Some of the first Post-Minimal sculptors retained the geometry of 
Minimalism, but they were hardly creating insular, discreet 
objects. To the contrary, their geometric forms were loaded with 
powerful emotional issues. 

EVA HESSE One of the outstanding Post-Minimalists in the 
1960s was Eva Hesse (1936-1970). Her accomplishment is aston¬ 
ishing when one considers that her career was cut short when she 
died of a brain tumor at age 34. Born in Hamburg, Germany, 


she was raised in New York after her Jewish parents fled Nazi 
persecution. Hesse worked with a variety of unusual materials, 
such as acrylic paint on papier-mache slathered over balloons. 
Her sculptures were abstract and had a basis in geometry. But 
because they reveal the dripping, pooling, flowing, stretching, and 
drying by which they took shape, they also suggest organic forms 
and processes, and growth and sexuality. In 1968, she began using 
fiberglass, which became her trademark material and was perhaps 
responsible for her brain cancer. 

A classic work is Untitled (fig. 29.23), which has as its starting 
point the geometric form of Minimalism. The four rectangular 
units of which it is composed imply boxes or framed paintings 
because of their curled edges. Contradicting their geometry are 
the uneven rippling surfaces and sides, which transform the fiber¬ 
glass into an organic substance, especially recalling skin. The 
strange ropelike latex appendages eccentrically flopping from 
either side of center suggest arms or legs, momentarily transform¬ 
ing the boxes or frames into a family of individuals. Ultimately, 
these appendages are nothing more than abstract elements, like 
the rectangular units. The work is full of contradictions: It is 
simultaneously funny and morbid, geometric and organic, erotic 
and repulsive, abstract and referential. (See www.myartslab.com. ) 
Perhaps the most powerful quality in Hesse s sculptures is the 
sense of frailty, wear, decay, and aging—best expressed in Untitled 
by the wobbly “legs. ” 

RICHARD SERRA Emerging at the same time was sculptor 
Richard Serra (b. 1939), who befriended Hesse. He explored the 
properties of sculpture in a series of works that included making 
process art, in which the creative act itself was the art, such as

1058 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 






Studying the Absent Object 

B y the 1 970s, art historians and critics were talking about the 
“dematerialization of the art object” in contemporary art. By this, 
they meant that art was no longer exclusively an object. Art was also 
something that could not be bought and sold, something so tempo¬ 
rary that it could be seen only for a brief time, making it difficult for 
scholars and critics to study, analyze, and write about it. Artists were 
now making temporary sculpture out of crumpled paper, bread placed 
on the mouth of a volcano, or patterns made in the snow. Many of the 
artists making temporary art photographed their work. The photo¬ 
graphs became works of art in themselves and allowed scholars to 
study the artists’ output. 

A handful of artists worked almost entirely in temporary mediums 
and left no record in photographs, films, or drawings. Not surprisingly, 
their careers along with their contributions and accomplishments are 
today underrecognized, if not virtually lost to art historians. Perhaps 
the most vulnerable artists were the performance artists who emerged 


toward 1 960 (see page 1 046). Yvonne Rainer and Robert Whitman, for 
example, had a wide following and strongly influenced art in the 
1 960s, but today they are largely forgotten. Their work was per¬ 
formed, sometimes once, sometimes for several weeks, and then it 
disappeared. During the 1 960s, Whitman, especially, had tremendous 
visibility. His integration of film projection into his Performance Pieces 
(see fig. 29.1 2) was startlingly innovative, anticipating the video instal¬ 
lations that would become popular in the 1 980s (see page 1 047). Like 
his performances, Whitman’s installations disappeared when they 
were dismantled and put into storage, where they cannot be seen, 
unlike conventional paintings or sculptures. Today, his Theater Pieces 
are occasionally performed, and one work, Prune Flat, has been 
acquired by a museum, the Dia Center for the Arts in New York, which 
owns the “score,” the detailed drawings for costumes, and instructions 
for performance.

throwing molten lead at the spot where floor and wall meet, a 
kind of Jackson Pollock action sculpture that resulted in a violent, 
energetic splattering on wall and floor. It also resulted in site- 
specific art, since it could not be removed from the site of its 
creation without substantially altering the work. 

By the late 1960s, Serra was making objects—now extremely 
heavy geometric lead forms—and invoking such themes as gravity, 
fear, and life and death. In Corner Prop (fig. 29.24), an enormous 
lead cube weighing thousands of pounds is precariously propped 
up against the wall with a lead rod, with nothing securing either 
element. The piece, like much of Serras sculpture from this 
period, communicates an unmistakable threat of violent collapse 
and an aura of danger that can be terrifying. In an even more 
frightening piece, Serra placed an enormous rectangular lead plate 
on the floor and another directly above, at a right angle, attached 
to the ceiling. The viewer was expected to walk on the one plate, 
thereby passing under the other. Serra s sculptures may look like 
Minimal Art, but they are loaded with narrative and emotion. 

Earthworks and Site-Specific Art 

By the late 1960s, the Post-Minimal aesthetic operated on an 
enormous scale, not only far beyond the confines of the gallery 
but far away from the art world, and in many instances in unin¬ 
habited remote areas. Several artists began sculpting with earth, 
snow, volcanoes, lightning, and deep-sea sites, their work often 
temporary and existing today only in photographs and drawings. 
Often the work had a strong geometric component, reflecting the 
influence of Minimal Art and Hard-Edge Abstraction. But in 
contrast, this sculpture generally was filled with references, 
including environmental, ontological (concerned with the nature 
of being), and political issues, as we will see in the work of Robert 
Smithson and the team of Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

STORI AN ’ 





ROBERT SMITHSON One of the most famous earthworks, 
works of art created by manipulating the natural environment, is 
Spiral Jetty (fig. 29.25), a site-specific sculpture made by Robert 
Smithson (1938-1973) in 1970. Smithson, who was a friend of 
Serra s, became a prominent figure in the New York art world in 
the mid- to late 1960s because of his articles on art, which often 
took an environmental approach to discussing land and nature. 
He also became known for his nonsite sculptures, which were 
“landscapes” consisting of rocks and stones from specific sites 
(often in neighboring New Jersey) that Smithson put into geo¬ 
metrically shaped metal bins or mirrored boxes on a gallery floor. 
A map or aerial photograph showed the actual site of the “land¬ 
scape. ” Instead of painting a landscape, Smithson was re-present¬ 
ing the real thing in the form of what looks like a Minimal 
sculpture. What a viewer was witnessing was the entropy, or 
steady degradation, of the land as it was removed from one site 
and taken to another. 

Like Hesse s sculpture, Smithsons Minimalist-looking sculp¬ 
ture is full of references and issues, which is apparent in Spiral Jetty. 
The work is 1,500 feet long, 15 feet wide, and involved moving 
6,650 tons of earth and black basalt. It is located at Rozel Point, 
a remote area of Utah’s Great Salt Lake, whose surrounding 


landscape looks like an industrial wasteland because of the rust¬ 
ing, discarded mining equipment littering the vicinity. Just as time 
consumes civilization, and all things for that matter, so too will 
the jetty eventually disappear as it erodes into the lake. The spiral 
form, as it wraps around itself, going nowhere, and trapping 
microorganisms that turn the water red, seems like the relic of a 
prehistoric civilization. Rather than just a minimal geometric 
shape to be admired for its own sake, Spiral Jetty is a powerful 
sculpture that utilizes time as a major component to speak about 
the entropy of all things. 

CHRISTO AND JE ANNE-CLAUDE Christo (Christo Javacheff, 
b. 1935) is a Bulgarian-born American artist. He met his French- 
born American wife and collaborator Jeanne-Claude (Jeanne- 
Claude de Guillebon, b. 1935) in Paris in 1958. There, the couple 
were interested in creating a social dialogue and provoking their 
audience to think about their immediate world. In one work, 
Christo and Jeanne-Claude dammed up a narrow Paris street with 
a neat Minimalist-looking stack of barrels, preventing passage. 
However, they are best known for wrapping unidentified objects 
in fabric, stimulating viewer curiosity about the object as well as 
the reason for the gesture. In 1964, they moved to New York.

Fabric, 18' x 24 1 /miles (5.5 m x 39.4 km) 


Their goal was to operate on an environmental or architectural 
scale, which they first did on a small scale in 1961 in Cologne 
(.Dockside Packages) and on a large scale in 1969 when they 
wrapped a 1-million-square-foot section of a rocky coast in 
Australia. Since then they have wrapped enormous buildings, and 
a bridge, and surrounded 11 islands with floating fabric, creating 
site-specific sculptures. 

Reproduced here is Running Fence (fig. 29.26), proposed in 
1972 and executed in 1976. On the one hand, the work looks like 
Minimal Art, since it consists of predetermined mathematical 
units that extend to fill an allocated space, here the 24^-mile 
(39.5-km) hilly terrain in California’s Sonoma and Marin coun¬ 
ties, with one terminus literally ending in the ocean. Each segment 
is 18 feet high and consists of cloth attached to steel poles. But 
this work is not only about the object itself, which was removed 
by the artists after being displayed for two weeks. Rather, it 
includes the entire process of implementing the concept: from the 
endless negotiations with government officials and landowners 
(mostly ranchers), the acquiring and supervising of an enormous 


workforce, the manufacturing of the work, and removal of it. It 
took four years to produce, the largest stumbling block being the 
tremendous community resistance. But the dialogue resulted in a 
raised consciousness about the land. It forced people to look at 
the land, and to think about it, recognizing how it was financially, 
emotionally, and aesthetically valued. The use of the word “fence” 
in the title specifically raised issues about how the land was to be 
used, and for whom. 

Once installed, Running Fence transformed the landscape. The 
fence itself was like a fleet of ships sailing across hill and dale. 
Probably hundreds of thousands of people came to experience it. 
In a documentary of the project, one rancher, who had fought 
the installation, described how he and his son slept next to the 
fence one night—listening to it ripple in the wind, watching the 
stars—in effect undergoing a transformative experience. And then 
it was gone. Nothing was left, except memories of experiences, 
pieces of the cloth, which were given to the landowners, and hun¬ 
dreds of drawings that Christo had made to finance the $3.2 mil¬ 
lion project, which Christo and Jeanne-Claude paid for themselves. 


CHAPTER 29 POSTWAR TO POSTMODERN, 1 945 -1 980 1 061 













Conceptual Art: Art as Idea 

Although the Frenchman Marcel Duchamp had made ideas the 
focus of art beginning in the 1910s (see page 970) and American 
George Brecht had begun to create a kind of conceptual art in the 
1950s (see page 1047), the term itself did not become common¬ 
place until the late 1960s, when a large number of artists started 
producing art that emphasized ideas rather than the aesthetics of 
style. Of course, ideas appear in all art, but the ideas are closely 
tied to the formal qualities of the art and cannot exist without 
them. In Conceptual Art, the art generally exists solely as an idea, 
with no visual manifestation other than words. Or the idea or 
information can appear as a graph, chart, map, or documentary 
photograph. In addition to works that are entirely Conceptual, 
we can also talk about art that is basically visual and aesthetic but 
has a Conceptual component as well. For example, Smithsons 
Spiral Jetty has such an element for we know that the work is 
going to very slowly disappear, which is something that was not 
visible when it was made in 1970. But with the Conceptual artists, 
idea, concept, or information will be the consuming quality of 
the work. 

JOSEPH KOSUTH By the late 1960s, more and more artists 
were making art based on ideas, and in 1970, the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York mounted an exhibition entitled 
Information , dedicated to Conceptual Art and taking as its thesis 
that art provides information and ideas, not visual aesthetics. 
The shows cocurator was artist Joseph Kosuth (b. 1945). 
Characteristic of Kosuth s own work is One and Three Chairs 
(fig. 29.27) of 1965, in which he combined a large gelatin-silver 
print of a folding chair with the real chair and a photograph of 


a dictionary definition of a chair. By using words instead of just 
an image, Kosuth tells us how cerebral and nonaesthetic his 
intentions are. 

The work appears to be a textbook study in semiotics—the 
science of signs—a popular topic in universities and in a small 
segment of the art community at the time. In the language of 
semiotics, the real chair is the “signified,” the photograph is the 
“signifier,” signifying that particular chair, and the dictionary 
definition is the idealized nonspecific chair. By arranging three 
versions of a chair in this particular way, Kosuth has determined 
their context, which leads a viewer to consider issues of language 
and meaning, rather than such typical art issues as beauty and 
expression. Reading the definition, we tend to think of the real 
chair next to it. If it were not present, we would probably think 
of some other chair from our own experience. If we look only at 
the photograph of a chair, we may even think the subject of the 
photograph is not necessarily the chair but the absence of a per¬ 
son sitting in the chair. The title is an important part of the work, 
for it too provides context, suggesting we can view the chairs as 
the same chair (one chair) or as three different chairs with very 
different stories. In other words, this work is about ideas as much 
as it is about the aesthetics of the visual presentation, which is as 
unemotional and straightforward as Minimalism. Ultimately, the 
task of establishing meaning is the viewer s. 

One and Three Chairs also reflects a new approach to photog¬ 
raphy that appeared in the mid-1960s: The medium was no longer 
the sacred preserve of professional photographers, who worked 
on a modest scale, carefully took their own photographs, and 
often slaved over their prints. Now, photographs were used by 
Installation, Earthwork, Performance, and Conceptual artists, 
who in their primary medium often worked on a large scale.

They now made photographs based on their work, and produced 
large photographs to suggest the scale of their primary work, 
the photographs even rivaling painting in size. Generally, they 
did not take their own pictures, and few if any did their own 
printing. Most shocking to traditional photographers, they often 
integrated photography into other mediums, as Kosuth did in 
One and Three Chairs , thus violating the time-honored integrity 
of the medium. 

JOSEPH BEUYS Beuys (1921-1986) was a German Conceptual 
artist who produced work so complex and rich in ideas it is nearly 
impossible to pin down exactly what his art is. His objects, dia¬ 
grams, photographs, and performances interrelate so tightly that 
no one piece can comfortably stand on its own. He was based in 
Dusseldorf, a city that by the 1970s was home to many of the 
world s leading artists, its art scene perhaps second only to New 
York s. Beuys played a major role in developing this artistic cli¬ 
mate. His impact included spurring German artists to confront 
their nation s Nazi past, to rediscover the German Romantic tra¬ 
dition, and to invest their art with spirituality, much as the 
German Expressionists had done in the early twentieth century. 

Two key factors in Beuyss development were his experiences 
in World War II as a fighter pilot in Hitler’s Luftwaffe (airforce) 
and the 1963 arrival in Dusseldorf of the Fluxus artists. Beuys 
propagated a myth that his plane was shot down in 1943 in a 
snowstorm over Crimea, and that nomadic Tartars saved him 
from freezing to death by covering him in animal fat and layers of 
felt, materials that became a foundation for much of his sculptural 
work. Whatever Beuys’s war experience actually was, it was 
clearly traumatic, for after attending the Dusseldorf Art Academy 
in the late 1940s, he disappeared into the German countryside to 
work as a farmhand and purge himself of his guilt and anxiety. 

In 1961, Beuys was teaching at the Dusseldorf Art Academy, 
and two years later he was introduced to Fluxus, adopting 
Performance Art and joining them for a segment of their 
European tour. In 1965, he performed How to Explain Pictures to 
a Dead Hare (fig. 29.28). For three hours he moved his lips as if 
silently lecturing the dead hare cradled in his arm about the pic¬ 
tures surrounding him on the walls. Attached to his left sole was 
felt, and to his right, steel, the one representing “spiritual 
warmth,” the other “hard reason.” Honey and gold paint covered 
Beuyss head, transforming him into a shaman, a high priest who 
uses magic to cure ills. The honey represented a life force. This 
mysterious ritualistic performance was about the meaninglessness 
of conventional picture making—art that had to be explained— 
and about the need to replace it with a more spiritual and natural 
form of communication, an art the meaning of which could be felt 
or intuited by a viewer rather than understood intellectually. The 
performance was designed to create a magical art that would cause 
people to invest their own lives with spirituality. Everyone who 
watched the performance apparently found it riveting and unfor¬ 
gettable, even if they did not understand it. His objects, too, such 
as a worn wooden chair with a pile of fat on its seat, affected 
people similarly.

Television Art: Nam June Paik 

Another artist who participated in Fluxus activities in Dusseldorf 
in the early 1960s was the Korean-born musician, Performance 
artist, and sculptor Nam June Paik (1932-2006). Paik’s back¬ 
ground was in music, but shortly after studying composition with 
John Cage in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1958, he became a radical 
Performance artist, exploring unconventional mediums. Living in 
Dusseldorf in 1963 and performing in the Fluxus program, he 
began making art using television monitors. He labeled television 
the “electronic superhighway” and declared it the medium of 
the future, dedicating his life to working with it. His earliest 
television art used single monitors with simple abstract patterns, 
such as a single horizontal or vertical line. Or using a magnet, he 
distorted a television signal to create arclike or wavy composi¬ 
tions. In 1964, he moved to New York, and with the launch of the

first affordable video camera by Sony, he began to use video as 
well as live-broadcast television. 

Paiks work in the 1970s became increasingly grand and com¬ 
plex. Typical of the more elaborate structure of the later work is a 
piece from 1995, Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S. (fig. 
29.29). Fed by numerous computer-controlled video channels, 
this installation consists of dozens of monitors inserted in a neon 
map of the 48 continental states. The rapidly changing images 
generally relate to the respective states, except for New York, 
which was fed from a live camera in the New York Holly 
Solomon Gallery, where the work was shown and from where our 
reproduction originates. 

In Electronic Superhighway , Paik reaffirms the prevalence of 
television in American society, presenting his work with the 
fast-paced continuous stream of information characteristic of 
broadcast television. The work celebrates American vernacular 
culture, both in its use of neon and television as mediums and in 
the Americana presented on the videos. Television is America, 
Paik tells us. It is, in effect, real life, because most Americans 
experience the world through their television screens. Paik is not 
condemning the medium, which would be antithetical to the 
objective position of a Fluxus artist, but simply revealing its 
power to define contemporary life. 


ART WITH A SOCIAL AGENDA 

Most of the postwar artists discussed thus far did not have a social 
agenda. Even some who did, such as Lichtenstein and Warhol, 
subversively buried their message so that it was not readily visi¬ 
ble, especially to the groups they criticized. While an atmosphere 
of counterculture dominated the vanguard art world paralleling 
the social revolution occurring not only in America but also 
worldwide by the late 1960s, few artists made political art. By the 
1970s, however, the trickle of artists making work that dealt with 
social issues began to swell into a torrent. So great was its influ¬ 
ence that we now think of social issues as playing a major role in 
avant-garde art for the last 35 years. An art with a social agenda 
became a key component of 1970s Post-Minimalism. 

Street Photography 

Not everyone was caught up in the economic boom and techno¬ 
logical euphoria of the 1950s. Some observers, including many 
outstanding photographers, perceived serious problems within 
American society In part inspired by the powerful photographs 
of Walker Evans (see fig. 28.54), they trained their cameras on the 
injustices smoldering beneath the placid surface of society and 


1064 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 














made what is often called street photography, a reference to their 
taking to the streets to find their imagery. They were free to do so 
because photography was not handcuffed by the Modernist aes¬ 
thetics of painting and sculpture that demanded an increasingly 
abstract nonreferential art. 

Perhaps the best known of the postwar street photographers is 
Robert Frank (b. 1924), who emigrated from Switzerland in the 
1940s. In 1955, Frank crisscrossed the nation, taking candid, 
unposed photographs in banal public settings, which he then pub¬ 
lished as a photoessay in a book called The Americans (1958). 
American publishers found his view of America so grim that 
Frank had to go to France to find someone to produce the book. 
An American edition finally came out in 1959 with an introduc¬ 
tion by Jack Kerouac (1922-1969), author of the classic Beatnik 
novel On the Road (1957). 

Like his friend George Segal, Frank used his work to reflect 
his concerns about the alienation and lack of spirituality in twen¬ 
tieth-century America. Drug Store , Detroit (fig. 29.30) is charac¬ 
teristic of his national portrait of emptiness, alienation, and 
despair. Under a barrage of bold advertising (reminding us of 
Andy Warhols Campbell's Soup Cans), some 15 men order, 
among other items, artificial orange whips, each patron seemingly 
unaware of the others. On the other side of the counter dutifully 
serving the white males are African-American women, undoubt¬ 
edly working for a minimum wage. Just as the cake is trapped in 
the airless foreground case, the waitresses seem trapped behind 
the counter in the drudgery of their menial jobs. The glare of bare 
fluorescent bulbs bouncing off linoleum, Formica, and plastic is 
a reminder of the period s deadening aesthetic of efficiency and 
modernity, while the monotonous lineup of jukeboxes on the 
counter opposite the patrons underlines the “sell, sell, sell” men¬ 
tality of American business. 

Unlike Bourke-White, Evans and Lange (see pages 1018 and 
1029), Frank avoids refinement in his documentary photographs. 
His prints are blurry and gritty, and grimy blacks violently con¬ 
trast with whites. Their harsh crudeness projects an undercurrent 
of unease and disquiet. We sense the speed with which Frank 
operated in the informal settings he encountered, wielding his 
35mm single-lens reflex camera as spontaneously as his instinct 
dictated. It should come as no surprise that the downtown 
Detroit where this photograph was taken was largely destroyed 
during the race riots of the late 1960s. (For a discussion of a 
second documentary photographer, Lee Friedlander, from this 
period, see the Introduction.)

heritage. At college and in art school, they were trained like 
everyone else to make abstract art. But their communities pres¬ 
sured them to do the exact opposite: Make narrative art and take 
up the black cause. To balance both claims was a challenge. 


African-American Art: Ethnic Identity 

Other American artists soon joined the street photographers and 
began doing what had been unthinkable in the art world of the 
1960s: turning their backs on both Minimalism and abstraction in 
general and instead making art about the nation s problems and 
issues, particularly those concerning race, ethnic background, gen¬ 
der, and sexual orientation. Because of the Civil Rights Movement, 
African-American artists were challenged to make art about their 


ROM ARE BEARDEN In New York in 1963, a number of 
African-American artists formed a loose group called Spiral, 
dedicated to supporting the Civil Rights Movement. They met in 
the studio of Romare Bearden (1911-1988), a New York 
University-educated mathematician and philosopher who in the 
1940s increasingly became a committed artist. Influenced by 
Martin Luther King, Jr.s 1963 March on Washington, D.C., 
Bearden suggested a collaborative project for Spiral that involved 
the members all contributing to a large photocollage about black

OURCE 


Romare Bearden (1911-1988) 



From a 1984 interview with Joseph Jacobs 

Romare Bearden talks about why collage was so important for him and 
its relationship to jazz. 

O ne of the attractions of collage for me is it allows me to work 
quickly, which is a very twentieth-century attitude. The devel¬ 
opment of the machine, and now of the computer, killed mans capac¬ 
ity for patience. It is too nervous a century for people to paint the 
way Jan van Eyck painted, for example. Many modern super-realist 
paintings, which may look as detailed as a Van Eyck, are made from 
photographs or slides which get projected onto the canvas and are 
then painted. Collage is the cutting out rather than the painting of 
things, and it allows a more direct way to get something down. Just 
cut it out and put it down. 

No, the physicality of the medium did not attract me to collage. 
Also, I don’t think of my use of collage as an extension of Abstract 


Expressionism. Rather I would like to think of it within the context 
of Cubism. My quarrel with Abstract Expressionism, if any, is that 
sometimes the space is naturalistic. If you place in one area of the can¬ 
vas a large field of blue, and then in another area you put an orange, 
you have painted sunlight, which is naturalistic space and light. I pre¬ 
fer to bring things forward, not just for the sake of making Cubism, 
but to make flat painting and not fool the eye with depth and perspec¬ 
tive. And that is achieved by having the collage sit on the surface. ... 

Yes, you can draw parallels between my work and jazz. As you just 
said, there is a spirit that is there before a work is begun and develops 
with the work that is similar to the kind of improvisation that one 
gets in jazz. ... [Jazz] has a rhythmic component, and it also has inter¬ 
val. When you listen to the piano of Earl Hines, what really counts is 
the silences between the notes struck. ... The same importance of 
interval can be seen in confetti thrown at a wedding; the confetti 
dazzles the eye, but it is the spaces between the pieces that really 
causes things to happen.

identity. When no one turned up, Bearden undertook the project 
by himself, cutting up newspapers and magazines to make col¬ 
lages, for which he became famous. 

The composition of Bearden’s collages is based on Cubism, as 
seen in The Prevalence of Ritual: Baptism (fig. 29.31), created in 
1964, but the subject matter is distinctly African-American. 
Bearden grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, before moving 
to New York City’s Harlem, and the fractured image shows a 
baptism, reflecting the importance of religion in black culture. 
The faces not only express the African physiognomy but in 
some instances also suggest African masks. This work has the 
effect of tracing American culture back to its African roots and 
reinforcing the continuous importance of ritual and community. 
The collage composition has a wild syncopation and even a sense 
of improvisation that seems to relate to the black jazz musicians 
of the period, such as Charlie Parker or John Coltrane. (See 
Primary Source , page 1066.) The power of Bearden’s work lies in 
the artist’s ability to pack so much information and energy into a 
single image that it overflows with the vitality and essence of the 
African-American experience, an energy we saw as well in the 
small temperas of Jacob Lawrence (see fig. 28.49). 

MELVIN EDWARDS At virtually the same moment, Melvin 
Edwards (b. 1937) took an entirely different approach to reflect¬ 
ing his racial background. Raised in Houston, Texas, and study¬ 
ing welded-steel sculpture and formalist aesthetics at the 
University of Southern California in Los Angeles, Edwards was 
outraged at the lynchings of blacks in the South, which were 
increasing as the Ku Klux Klan responded to the Civil Rights 
Movement. In 1963, he began to make a series of relief sculptures 
entitled Lynch Fragments (fig. 29.32), incorporating chains and 
spikes and brutal metal fragments, all of which took on a brown 
tonality when oiled to prevent rusting. 

While there is no set reading of these works—which Edwards, 
a New York resident, continues to make today along with monu¬ 
mental sculpture—they evoke oppression, bondage, violence, and 
anger, as well as skin color. They also appear to refer to African 
masks (which the artist denies is intended) and ritual, and in their 
bold frontality they display a sense of confrontation and dignity. 
These basically abstract works, which fulfilled the demands of his 
university teaching to make nonrepresentational art, are so open 
to interpretation that we can view them as autobiographical as 
well. A horseshoe that appears in many of the Lynch Fragments is 
the artist’s reminiscence of visits to his uncle s ranch outside of 
Houston. Edwardss political and expressive abstraction stands in 
stark contrast to the Minimalist Art being produced at the same 
time and anticipated Post-Minimal sculpture. 

BETYE SAAR With Betye Saar (b. 1926), there is no attempt to 
accommodate the art establishment by catering to formalist 
abstraction. Her work is brazenly representational and, like 
Bearden, her themes are obviously dedicated to her African- 
American heritage. Saar, who is from Los Angeles, where she still 
lives, got her B.A. in design from the University of California,

Los Angeles, and graduate degrees in education and printmaking 
from nearby universities. But it was not until she experienced first 
hand the Surrealist assemblage boxes of the New Yorker Joseph 
Cornell in 1968 that she found her mature artistic voice. She 
began working in the same technique, as can be seen in Shield of 
Quality (fig. 29.33) of 1974. The work is part of a series of boxes 
inspired by the death of the artist’s great-aunt. Each is like a 
Victorian keepsake box, containing relics of the ancestor—a 
glove, a feather from a hat, lace, buttons, and a baby spoon, for 
example. Vintage photographs are arranged in a triptych, trans¬ 
forming the box into a portable altar. The shrine pays homage to 
the values the great-aunt handed down, values reflected in the 
quality and propriety of the objects themselves. And the box 
counters Americas racial stereotyping by presenting African 
Americans as middle-class, a reminder that Saar was born in 1926 
and grew up in precivil-rights America. 

Like so much of Saars work, Shield of Quality focuses on 
women and is also about female pride and the important role of

women in society. Clearly by working on a small-scale and mak¬ 
ing delicate effeminate work, Saar was defying the art establish¬ 
ment, turning her back on the enormous canvases and sculptures 
being churned out by white males. With Saar, we have stepped 
into the feminist era. 

Feminist Art: 

Judy Chicago and Gender Identity 

Betty Friedan’s 1963 book The Feminine Mystique signaled the 
start of the feminist movement. Almost simultaneously a number 
of women artists began making work that dealt with womens 
issues. Nancy Spero (b. 1926) made simple but powerful expres- 
sionistic drawings depicting violence toward women, while Mimi 
Smith (b. 1942) made what is now recognized as the first 
American clothing art, objects such as a Minimalist Girdle (1966), 
constructed of rubber bathmats that capture the discomfort of 
womens clothing. And, as just discussed, Betye Saar made boxes 
that paid homage to women. 

The best-known work coming out of the womens movement 
is The Dinner Party (fig. 29.34), orchestrated by Judy Chicago 
(b. 1939) and made by over 400 women between 1974 and 1979. 
By the late 1960s, Chicago was a dedicated feminist, who in the 
early 1970s established a Feminist Art Program, the first of its 
kind, at California State University at Fresno. Shortly thereafter, 
with artist Miriam Schapiro (b. 1923), she started a second similar 


program at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. The 
thrust of these courses was to encourage women to make art and 
deal with gender issues, which the art world, including university 
and art-school faculties, said she could not do because the work 
did not conform to the aesthetic norms of Modernist formalism 
that signified serious art. The Feminist Art Program was designed 
to provide support for women artists and to redefine aesthetic 
values in contemporary art. 

The Dinner Party reflects Chicago’s shift from a maker of 
abstract Minimalist objects and paintings to works on feminist 
themes in alternative mediums and installations. It pays homage 
to the many important women who Chicago felt were ignored, 
underrated, or omitted from the history books. Chicago labori¬ 
ously researched these lost figures. She then designed a tri¬ 
angular table with 39 place settings, 13 to a side, each honoring 
a significant woman, ranging from ancient goddesses to such 
twentieth-century icons as Georgia O’Keeffe. In addition, 919 
other women’s names are inscribed on the white floor tiles lying 
in the triangular intersection of the tables. Each place setting 
included a hand-painted ceramic plate that pictured a vagina exe¬ 
cuted in a period style. American poet Emily Dickinson’s sex, for 
example, is surrounded by lace, and French queen Eleanor of 
Aquitaine’s is encased in a fleur-de-lis. Under each place setting is 
an embroidered runner, often elaborate and again in period style. 

Instead of using bulldozers, chainsaws, hoists, and welding 
equipment as men did for their environments, Chicago intention-

ally turned to mediums associated with women—painted china, 
ceramics, and embroidery—and created an elegant, beautiful work 
that subtly operates on an epic scale, spanning millennia. Also 
present is a sense of community and ritual, for we feel as though 
Chicago has appropriated and transformed the Christian male 
theme of the Last Supper into a spiritual communion of women. 

LATE MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE 

Modernist architecture thrived after World War II, especially in 
America, which had previously preferred traditionalist architec¬ 
ture (skyscrapers, for example, in a Gothic style) as discussed in 
the previous chapter (see pages 1020-21). But now Modernist 
architecture was only a look or style. It no longer had the utopian 
vision and revolutionary zeal to improve the world that we saw in 
the High Modernism of De Stijl and the Bauhaus (see pages 


1007-10), and in the art and design of Constructivist 
Productivism (see pages 1003-05). However, some of the most 
influential buildings of the period continued to be built by the 
major High Modernist architects: Wright, Mies van der Rohe, and 
Le Corbusier. While Mies continued the International Style 
aesthetic of light, floating geometric buildings with taut, thin glass 
walls, Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, joined by the 
emerging Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn, developed a sculp¬ 
tural architecture that emphasized mass and the physical presence 
of a building, and they were not afraid to be referential. 

Continuing the International Style: 

Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 

Postwar Late Modernism resulted in glass boxes sprouting up in 
urban centers and dotting the beltways that circled American 
cities, especially beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. The glass box

became the required image for corporate headquarters, such as 
I. M. Pei and Henry N. Cobb’s John Hancock Center in Boston 
(1977) and Skidmore, Owens, and Merrills Sears Tower in 
Chicago (1974). If one were to choose a single building to epito¬ 
mize the Late Modernist skyscraper it would have to be Mies van 
der Rohe’s Seagram Building (fig. 29.35) in New York, built from 
1954 to 1958, with interiors by Philip Johnson (1906-2005). This 
building was imitated worldwide, but rarely did the imitations 


begin to approach the perfection that Mies achieved with his 
aesthetic of “Less is more” (see page 1010). 

We can see these minimal gestures in the Seagram Building. 
Mies began by removing the 38-story building from its urban 
environment and placing it on a pedestal, that is a plaza elevated 
above street level. The plaza is simple but sumptuous; it is made 
of pink granite, has two shallow pools placed symmetrically 
on either side of the building, and is surrounded by a low serpen¬ 
tine marble wall. The weightless tinted glass-and-bronze tower 
sits on a colonnade of pilotis that leaves the first floor open, and 
every detail, including the paving stones, is carefully propor¬ 
tioned to create a sense of perfection and elegance. With the rise 
of Hitler in Germany, Mies had joined Moholy-Nagy at the new 
Bauhaus in Chicago, and in the Seagram Building we can see the 
influence of the nineteenth-century Chicago School in the 
emphasis on the skeletal grid of the building. To acknowledge the 
functionalism of the grid, Mies used thin I-beams for the 
mullions between windows. They provide the vertical accent that 
the proportions of the horizontal spandrels so perfectly counter¬ 
balance with their thin ridges on top and bottom. Inside and out, 
lavish, beautifully harmonized materials embellish the building’s 
exquisite proportions. 


Sculptural Architecture: Rejerential Mass 

Mies’s architecture was essentially nonreferential, just like 
Minimalist sculpture. However, his contemporaries Le Corbusier 
and Frank Lloyd Wright took Late Modernist architecture in a 
different direction. Their buildings contain references and are 
organic, if not outright expressionistic. Made of poured concrete, 
they are massive monumental buildings that have a powerful 
sculptural presence. 

LE CORBUSIER In his late style, Le Corbusier abandoned the 
taunt, light walls and floating architecture of his early villas for a 
massive, sculptural, and even referential style. This late work can 
be quite expressive, even to the point of being oppressively mas¬ 
sive and harsh, and it is often referred to as Brutalist. Especially 
abrasive is his use of concrete, which instead of being smooth and 
highly finished is now left raw, having a rough texture and reveal¬ 
ing the pattern of the wood forms. 

A sculptural masterpiece from this period is Notre-Dame-du- 
Haut (fig. 29.36), a chapel in Ronchamp, France, built from 1950 
to 1955. While the main interior space is basically simple, an 
oblong nave, the exterior erupts with diagonals and curves. The 
concrete-covered masonry walls are thick and massive, and the 
poured concrete roof, which is hollow and the concrete left raw, 
is ponderous, even if it paradoxically seems to float. Visitors enter 
the front through an enormous fissure in the wall, giving them a 
sense of slipping through a cleft in a rock formation. The pointed 
facade reminds us of a ship’s prow, while the roof recalls the bot¬ 
tom of a boat, allusions to such vessels of salvation as Noah’s Ark 
and St. Peter’s fishing boat. But these shapes also suggest a nun’s 
cowl, praying hands, and a church spire. The vertical towerlike

forms to the left, a bell tower, and right resemble the nearby 
prehistoric dolmens of Carnac (see fig. 1.24). A sense of the 
primordial continues in the cavelike interior, where the ceiling 
precipitously drops from 32 feet over the altar to 16 feet in the 
center of the room. Faint streams of colored light pierce the 
stained-glass windows set in the thick walls (fig. 29.37), gently 
illuminating the space and giving it a mystical aura. Regardless of 
religion, anyone visiting Notre-Dame-du-Haut is likely to be 
transported to the realm of the mysterious and magical.

LOUIS KAHN Louis Kahn (1901-1974) is a difficult artist to 
place and is alternatively labeled an Expressionist, a Brutalist, 
and a Proto-Postmodernist. He was in his fifties when he finally 
found his architectural voice, largely due to a year spent at the 
American Academy in Rome in 1950-51. Here, he awakened to 
the importance and power of the ancient monuments of the 
Mediterranean, from the pyramids of Egypt to the baths and 
aqueducts of Rome to the Athenian Akropolis. Their bold, 
sculptural forms and pure geometry evoked a timeless serenity 
and Classical grandeur and became the building blocks of his 
Modernist aesthetic. In the late 1950s, Kahn discovered the 
Expressionist, Brutalist style of late Le Corbusier, of whom 
Kahn said, “He was my teacher, although he didn’t know it.” 
He rejected High Modernism s emphasis on light volume defined 
by a taut membrane as he instead designed massive, weighty 


structures that evoked ancient civilizations that seemed capable of 
defying the ravages of time. 

We can see these qualities in his 1962 ferroconcrete National 
Assembly Building in Dacca, Bangladesh (fig. 29 . 38 ). The assem¬ 
bly chamber is in the center, surrounded by concentric circles of 
meeting rooms, press offices, and a mosque, each building sepa¬ 
rated by unroofed walkways, creating a veritable light-filled city. 
Monumental triangles, rectangles, and circles puncture the mas¬ 
sive walls of each ring of rooms, allowing light to filter in and vir¬ 
tually structure the space. The entire complex looks like a fortress, 
the outer wall projecting the sublime presence of antiquity, 
although functionally it is designed to keep out the harsh sun of 
the Indian subcontinent. As we shall see in the next chapter, 
Kahn s referential architecture would inspire the next generation 
of architects.

The Postmodern Era: 

Art Since 1980 


T he art that came to the art world’s attention toward 

1980 is generally known as Postmodern art. The term was coined in the 
mid-1960s by European literary critics, and was applied to the theories 
of such French philosophers as Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), Roland 
Barthes (1915-1980), and Michel Foucault (1926-1984), as well as to the sociologist 


and cultural critic Jean Baudrillard (1979-2007) and psychoana¬ 
lyst Jacques Lacan (1901-1981). At the heart of much European 
Postmodernism, which is also called Deconstructionism or Post- 
Structuralism, is the premise that all text, and by extension visual 
art, contains hidden hierarchies of meaning “by which,” as 
Derrida expressed it, “an order is imposed on reality and by 
which a subtle repression is exercised, as their hierarchies exclude, 
subordinate, and hide the various potential meanings.” In other 
words, any text or artwork has an agenda, or point of view, as 
does any interpretation or use of a text or art. Revealing this 
agenda means “deconstructing” it. The result is there are no fixed 
truths or realities, no absolutes—just “hierarchies,” which are 
forever changing. We shall see an especially fine example of this 
theory later in the chapter when we look at the art of Fred Wilson, 
who in 1992 placed slave manacles in a case of fine silver at the 
Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore (see fig. 30.19). The 
society was presenting the silver as refined aesthetic objects, 
reflecting the evolution of style. By inserting the manacles, 
Wilson changed the context of the silver, and thus he changed its 
meaning as well—now the goblets, pitchers, and teapots became 
icons of wealth brought about by the enslavement of blacks. As 
reflected in Wilsons deconstruction of the historical society’s 
display, artists and critics starting in the late 1970s began to digest

European Postmodernism and were applying it to art. They were 
especially interested in how art functioned as a visual language, 
particularly as one of propaganda, manipulation, and power that 
determined taste and values and structured, for example, ethnic, 
sexual, racial, and gender identities. 

In a sense, these ideas were not entirely new to the 1970s art 
world. We have already seen Marcel Duchamp dealing with simi¬ 
lar issues in the 1910s, and Robert Rauschenberg, George Brecht, 
Joseph Kosuth, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and especially 
Sigmar Polke touching on them as well in the 1950s and 1960s. 
While the immediate seeds of Postmodernism in the visual arts 
date from this time, a self-consciousness about entering a new era 
only occurred in the art world in the late 1970s. In large part, this 
new awareness stemmed from the critical writing in a new art 
magazine, October , founded in 1976, which reflected European 
Postmodern philosophy. (See www.myartslab.com. ) As a result, a 
large number of artists and critics asked more overtly and persist¬ 
ently: How do words and images acquire meaning? What is the 
message? Who originates it? What—and whose—purpose does it 
serve? Who is the audience and what does this tell us about the 
message? Who controls the media—and for whom? More and 
more artists, such as Fred Wilson, began using familiar images in 
new contexts, revealing—or deconstructing —their deeper social, 
political, economic, and aesthetic meanings. The preferred medi¬ 
ums for many of these artists were those of the mass media, 
namely photography, electronic signs, billboards, and video. 


CHAPTER 30 THE POSTMODERN ERA: ART SINCE 1 980 





While this Postmodernist attitude emerged toward 1980, it has 
been only one of numerous issues that have preoccupied the art 
world in the last 30 years. The period is characterized by plural¬ 
ism, in effect continuing the pluralism associated with 1970s Post- 
Minimalism (see pages 1058-69). Now, however, pluralism had a 
philosophical foundation in Postmodern theory. By denying any 
one system, reading, interpretation, or truth, Postmodern theory 
destroyed the credibility of the authoritarian hierarchies of styles, 
mediums, issues, and themes, and it opened the door for every¬ 
thing and everyone. It also had an enormous impact on art 
history, as art historians began to question the validity of the 
traditional story of art, generally told from a narrow viewpoint, 
generally male-centric and European-American, and emphasizing 
the evolution of style. Now, scholars approached art from count¬ 
less angles, using issues of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, 
race, economics, and politics to demonstrate the many layers of 
meaning and ideas embedded in a work of art. In part, this trend 
had begun in the late 1960s, a result of the social revolution that 
accompanied the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War and 
challenged the validity of the status quo. 

Postmodernism marked the end of the Modernist era, which 
peaked in the 1950s and 1960s with such styles as Abstract 
Expressionism and Minimal Art. Modernism viewed modern art 
as a linear progression of one style building upon the last, contin¬ 
uously advancing art toward the “new ” Because of this emphasis 
on style, tremendous importance was placed on the individual and 
stylistic originality. But the pluralism of the 1970s accompanied 
by Postmodern theory ended the need for artists to invent the 
new. By the 1980s, artists had license not to be new. Not only did 


they appropriate art in every imaginable style and medium from 
the history of civilization and combine them as they saw fit, many 
of the leading artists, such as Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Jeff Koons, 
Kiki Smith, and Damien Hirst, did not even concern themselves 
with cultivating a distinguishable style as they jumped from one 
medium to the next, relying on a theme rather than a look to tie 
their work together. Message was more important than a readily 
identifiable, single style, a hallmark of Modernism. Artists also 
challenged the premium that Modernism placed on individuality 
and authorship, with many artists collaborating or working in 
groups, such as the Guerrilla Girls and Group Material. 

The Postmodern era also redefined the nature of the art world 
itself. The art establishment widened to embrace artists of all 
ethnicities and races, accepting all kinds of mediums, styles, and 
issues without placing a value on one over another. In this new 
environment, often referred to as multiculturalism, artists who 
had been marginalized in the 1970s became mainstream. 
Furthermore, in the 1990s, artists from all over the world, not just 
America and Europe, played a major role in molding contempo¬ 
rary art. A benchmark exhibition for presenting this new world 
view was Magiciens de la Terre , organized in 1988 by the National 
Museum of Modern Art (Pompidou Center) in Paris and featur¬ 
ing artists from all the continents. 

The acceptance of artists worldwide mirrors the global 
restructuring of the last 20 years. The Cold War ended as the 
Berlin Wall fell in 1988 and the U.S.S.R. was dissolved soon after. 
Political and economic realignments resulted as first Russia and 
then China abandoned a strict adherence to Communism, exper¬ 
imented with capitalism, and opened up to foreign trade and 


1076 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 




















investment. In the 1990s, Europe formed the European Union, 
and the United States, Mexico, and Canada signed the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Barriers were falling everywhere, 
with people crossing borders more readily than ever before. 
Another important force behind the creation of a world art is the 
long-term impact of the independence movements, especially in 
Africa and Asia, of the 1950s and 1960s. These new post-colonial 
nations asserted their cultural traditions as viable and valuable 
alternatives to mainstream culture, which in the last 25 years have 
increasingly been woven into the fabric of a world culture. 

But perhaps the communications field more than anything else 
was responsible for the creation of the “Global Village.” 
Television, cellular phones, satellites, computers, global position¬ 
ing systems, and the Internet have linked the world, reminding us 
that the Post-Industrial era is also the Information Age. Today, 
the worlds leading artists come from countries as varied as 
Lebanon, Iran, Israel, Cambodia, Thailand, Korea, India, Japan, 
China, South Africa, Mali, Russia, Colombia, Brazil, Cuba, and 
Iceland. They readily travel the globe, often have studios in 
numerous countries, and exhibit regularly worldwide, especially 
participating in the international explosion of contemporary art 
fairs and annual or biennial art shows that take place in such dis¬ 
parate venues as Istanbul, Dubai, Moscow, Johannesburg, Saigon, 
Havana, and Shanghai. 

In this world of complex media and changing interpretations, 
scholars do not always agree on the meaning of Postmodernism. 
While the term initially was applied specifically to the European 
philosophy that emerged in the 1960s, today scholars and art his¬ 
torians use it quite loosely to encompass all of the art made since 
1980. In effect, they use it to mean art made after Modernism, and 
we will use it in the same way here. But the sign that we have 
nonetheless entered a new era is the fact that we can no longer 
treat art as a succession of isms or styles. While some historians 
and critics have tried to identify movements or styles, such as 
Neo-Expressionism, Neo-Geo, and Neo-Conceptualism, these 
are forced labels that do not hold up to scrutiny. Unlike the other 
chapters in this book, the fine art will be presented not within the 
context of style but instead under headings of theme or issue. 

ARCHITECTURE 

Postmodernism appeared in architecture in the 1960s and was 
accompanied by a manifesto of sorts. In his book Complexity and 
Contradiction (1966), the architect Robert Venturi called for a new 
architecture, one that rejected the cold, abstract Modernist Inter¬ 
national Style. The new architecture would be referential, that is, 
buildings would recall earlier architectural styles, or contain 
motifs that referred to the past and present. By the 1980s, an archi¬ 
tecture that the architectural community labeled “Postmodern” 
had emerged. The term, however, was used specifically to describe 
work that made references to earlier periods and styles. 

Since fundamental to European Postmodern theory is the con¬ 
cept that no one authoritative style or set of principles can prevail, 


architecture since the 1980s reflects a broad range of issues and 
interests, going well beyond just designing referential buildings. 
Among them is a revised Modernism, one strain of which we can 
call Hi-Tech because of its highly technological appearance. 
Another strain is Deconstructivism, a concept relating to 
Derrida s theories of Deconstruction and embracing the notion 
that architecture should not have a fixed structure or logic, thus 
being wide open to interpretation. 

Postmodern Architecture: A Referential Style 

Modernist architecture, best characterized by High Modernism 
or the International Style (see page 1010), was rule-bound and 
abstract. Some architectural critics—as well as the general pub¬ 
lic—found it cold and impersonal. With Postmodernist architec¬ 
ture, buildings, as in the nineteenth century, once again contain 
references to earlier architectural styles. Sometimes they project a 
sense of place, imparting an aura of uniqueness that makes them 
special to those using them. While Postmodern architecture did 
not come to the fore until about 1980, a handful of architects had 
been advocating and practicing a new architecture by the 1960s, 
among them Robert Venturi. 

ROBERT VENTURI Robert Venturi (b. 1925) upset the archi¬ 
tectural establishment by attacking Modernist architecture in 
Complexity and Contradiction. He challenged Mies van der 
Rohe s dictum “Less is more” with “Less is a bore” and argued 
that architecture could be whatever the architect wanted it to be. 
He asserted that art and the architectural past, as well as life itself, 
are filled with complexity and contradiction, and buildings should 
be too. Instead of being pure, simple, and conventional, buildings 
should be complicated, rich, and filled with references to the past 
and to the present as well. Buildings should contain meanings, 
even if these are contradictory, as had been the case in Mannerist 
architecture (see page 592). And structures could be fun and 
humorous as well as serious. Venturi s idol was Louis Kahn, who 
was also based in Philadelphia and whose Modernist buildings, 
such as the National Assembly Building (see fig. 29.38) in Dacca, 
Bangladesh, are filled with overt historical references. Venturi 
admired Kahn s daring use of symbolism and historical layering. 
Venturi outraged the architectural world again in 1972, when he 
published Learning from Las Vegas with his wife, the architect 
Denise Scott Brown. The couple declared Los Angeles and Las 
Vegas to be the modern-day equivalents of ancient Rome and 
Renaissance Florence, and they proposed that the strip malls, 
neon signs, and highways of these American cities reflected 
contemporary needs and a new architectural language, one that 
should be embraced by architects. 

Venturi practiced what he preached. In 1962, he designed a 
house for his mother in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia (fig. 30.1). 
The structure resembles a Modernist abstraction of flat planes, 
strict geometry, clean lines, and a play of forms and spaces, 
notably in the enormous cleft in the center of the facade. But 
the house is also referential, for it is a parody of a conventional

American home, complete with a slanted gable (the actual roof is 
much lower), a nineteenth-century pane-glass window, twenti¬ 
eth-century tract-house sliding-glass windows, a front porch, and 
behind that a large rectangular block that looks like a chimney but 
is not, since the real chimney, much smaller, pokes up out of it. 
Venturi then complicates the house with endless architectural 
references—the cleft, for example, derives from Kahn’s medieval- 
city buildings with slotted parapets and lintels embedded in the 
wall. The use of the “lintel,” which seems to support the two 
halves of the facade, combined with the opening of the porch, 
recalls an Egyptian pylon, while the broken segmental arch, func¬ 
tioning like a molding, brings to mind Pierre Lescots Square 
Court at the Louvre (see fig. 18.2). Venturi has imbued the over¬ 
scale house with humor, irony, and allusions, transforming the 
traditional American home into a rich architectural statement. 

MICHAEL GRAVES The American architect whose name is 
perhaps most synonymous with Postmodern architecture is 
Michael Graves (b. 1934), who is based in Princeton, New Jersey. 
He rose to national attention in 1980 when he received a commis¬ 
sion for the Public Services Building (fig. 30.2) in Portland, 
Oregon. The design is filled with paradox, as every element on the 
building’s surface begs to be seen in several ways: flat and sculp¬ 
tural, representational and abstract, historical and modern. 

The form of the building is a Palladian cube sitting atop a plat¬ 
form, with the square or near-square motif echoed in the outline 
of the facade and in additional squares within (for example, the 


enormous mirror-glass window, which encases a square defined 
by the maroon vertical piers). The individual windows are each 4 
feet square. The wall can be read as a flat mural, a thin Modernist 
membrane stretched over the metal skeleton; but suddenly it 
becomes three-dimensional and sculptural, an effect heightened 
by the maroon-colored vertical shafts in front of the large mirror 
window. These mullionlike shafts become the fluting of pilasters, 
topped with bracket capitals, which support an enormous key¬ 
stone above. Yet, if you read the keystone with the beige-colored 
wall, it becomes part of a flat arch framing the mirror window. 
The facade can even be described as anthropomorphic, for the 
pilasters and keystone can be read as a huge face, the capitals as 
eyes, and the pilasters as legs. The building has a whimsical sense 
of play, but it is also serious, recalling such great historical mod¬ 
els as Palladio, Mannerism, and one of Gravess favorite predeces¬ 
sors, John Soane, who is reflected here in the sublime pilasters (see 
fig. 24.30). The enormous curtain-wall window, massive corner 
piers, and prominent “pediment” bring to mind Behrens’s 
Turbinenfabrik (see fig. 27.35), not coincidentally one of the great 
Early Modernist buildings made just before Modernism aban¬ 
doned all overt reference to the historical past. 

JAMES STIRLING As subtle, complex, and difficult as Graves 
is the London architect James Stirling (1926-1992), as can be seen 
in his Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart (fig. 30.3). This museum and 
theater complex is located on the side of a steep hill, with a high¬ 
way at its base and a city street above. Like Kahn’s National

Assembly Building, Stirling s bold massing of simple forms and 
switchback ramps evoke ancient civilizations. Egypt especially 
comes to mind because of the large pylonlike forms and clefts 
that allow for narrow passageways. The pattern of alternating 
sandstone and travertine suggests medieval Italian structures, 
while the enormous wavelike window of the museum reverber¬ 
ates with memories of Paxtons Crystal Palace (see fig. 25.39) 
and the great curtain-wall window in Behrens s Turbinenfabrik. 
The curving window also suggests a grand piano, reminding us 
of the building s function as a performance hall. The pink and 
blue tubular railing and the blue I-beam support for the 
“pedimented” museum entrance are Hi-Tech and industrial. The 
same can be said for the skeletal taxi stand, whose ferrovitreous 
construction is also reminiscent of Paxton, while its form recalls a 
Greek temple. As in the work of Venturi and Graves, all these 
familiar sources are seamlessly melded into a unified vision that 
brings the past into the present. The result is a building that is 
distinctly modern yet imparts a Kahn-like monumentality and 
aura of importance. 


New Modernisms: High-Tech Architecture 

Late 1970s and 1980s Postmodernist architecture, with its histori- 
cism and symbolism, was important for launching new architec¬ 
tural freedoms. Released from the narrow constraints of pure 
Modernism, architects were free to explore a new range of possi¬ 
bilities that went well beyond the eclectic historical references of 
Postmodernism. Facilitating and even encouraging artistic license 
was the worldwide economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s, when 
unprecedented amounts of private and corporate money poured 
into building projects, dramatically energizing architecture and 
architectural vision. Just as New York real-estate developers in 
the 1920s had competed to create the tallest building, so clients 
worldwide now strove to erect the most spectacular, exciting 
structure, one with international cachet. At every level, the public 
was no longer settling for undistinguished generic Modernist 
buildings. Even the American strip malls of the 1980s were 
designed as Mediterranean minicities (Victorian, Queen Anne, 
Tudor, and Romanesque were popular styles as well), with many

of those built in earlier decades in a Modernist style getting 
Postmodern facelifts. 

Major Postmodern architecture in the vein of Venturi and 
Graves faded in the 1990s, superseded by an exhilarating diversity 
that expanded architecture to a true Postmodernism, if we use the 
term in its broadest sense to mean pluralism. Many architects now 
revisited Modernism, reinvigorating it with the new artistic 
license that had emerged during the late 1970s. An extreme 
version of this New Modernism is Hi-Tech, whose buildings 
resemble powerful industrial machines. Like Postmodern archi¬ 
tecture, the most immediate roots of Hi-Tech design can be found 
in a few examples in the 1950s and 1960s, one of the earliest being 
James Stirlings 1959-63 Engineering School in Leicester, 
England. Perhaps the most famous prototype for Hi-Tech 
Modernism is the 1971-77 Pompidou Center (fig. 30 . 4 ) in Paris. 
There, architects Richard Rogers (b. 1933) and Renzo Piano 
(b. 1937) exposed the building s utilities—instead of being buried 
within the interior, they are displayed on scaffolding around the 
perimeter of what is otherwise a classical Modernist glass box. 
Elevators, escalators, and plumbing, electrical, and ventilation 
ducts are all prominently displayed as exterior “ornament.” 
Besides challenging architectural aesthetics, this device has the 
advantage of completely opening up the interior space, allowing 
for any necessary configuration. 

NORMAN FOSTER By the late 1970s, Hi-Tech Modernism had 
come to the fore, its arrival announced in part by the eye-popping 
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HKSB) (fig. 30 . 5 ), designed in 
1979 by Norman Foster (b. 1935) at a cost of $1 billion. Here was 
a skyscraper that did not look like a skyscraper. Gone is the grid 
of the typical office tower, replaced by a complex structural appa¬ 
ratus that looks like a machine. The building is composed of 
four units, each consisting of four colossal piers that are pushed 
to either end of the rectangular building. Mammoth trusswork 
supports are cantilevered from these piers, and the floors then 
hang from these cantilevers in five stacked groups of six to nine 
floors each, groups that Foster called “villages.” Elevators stop 
only on the communal floor of each village, and escalators then 
connect the remaining floors. All the services, including elevators, 
are placed in sleek shafts at either end of the building, allowing the 
interior to be virtually free of obstructions (fig. 30 . 6 ). Foster 
transformed the ground floor into a piazza, opening it up to the 
surrounding streets and leaving it unlevel since the streets them¬ 
selves are at different elevations. The piazza has an enormous 
curved ceiling, penetrated by escalators that ascend to a spectacu¬ 
lar atrium, extending ten stories and 170 feet high, as seen in our 
reproduction, off which are balconies of workspace. On the south 
side of the building, computer-driven mirrors, called “sun 
scoops,” track the sun and reflect light onto a second set of

mirrors that in turn direct it down into the piazza, which becomes 
filled with spectacular natural light strong enough to cast shad¬ 
ows. Inside and out, machines, mechanics, a megastructure of 
trusswork, rooftop maintenance hoists, and sleek service shafts 
define the building, giving it an appearance of industrial strength, 
efficiency, and functionalism. 


Deconstructivism: 

Countering Modernist Authority 


In 1988, the Museum of Modern Art in New York mounted an 
exhibition titled Deconstructivism. The show included seven 
architects whose work displayed a Constructivist geometry (see 
page 1003) and planarity that created an architecture of “disrup- 
tion, dislocation, deviation, and distortion,” as Mark Wigley, who 
cocurated the exhibition with architect Philip Johnson, wrote in 
the accompanying catalogue. Originally the show was to have 
been called “Violated Perfection,” which would have spared 
everyone from struggling to determine what Deconstructivism 
actually is. The label caught on, however, with none of its advo¬ 
cates agreeing on a definition or even who the core 
Deconstructivists were. The shows curators derived the term 
from Derridas theory of Deconstruction. Essentially, Derrida 
posits that there are no firm meanings to any written text; outside 
of the text there are infinite forces that continually restructure its 
meaning and provide endless readings and interpretations. 
Similarly, Deconstructivist architecture had no fixed meaning. 
Wigley linked architectural Deconstructivism with Russian 
Constructivism. This connection is based on style and not theory, 
since Constructivism was about establishing a new order and a 
utopian perfection, whereas Deconstructivism focused on deny¬ 
ing any fixed structure or logic.

Ironically, most of the architects in the show had no or little 
interest in Derrida, and if they did, it was through indirect associ¬ 
ations rather than a reading of his abstruse writings. That said, a 
major trend emerged in the 1980s that challenged the idea that 
architecture had to adhere to any single concept or ideal. These 
architects rebelled against the notion that architecture had to 
aspire to some kind of perfection, order, or logic. 

COOP HIMMELBLAU Early advocates of this movement are 
Wolf Prix (b. 1942) and Helmut Swiczinsky (b. 1944), whose 
Viennese firm Coop Himmelblau was included in the 1988 
Deconstructivism exhibition. Their aesthetic is prominently dis¬ 
played in the rooftop conference room (fig. 30.7) they designed in 
1983 for a law firm in Vienna. No explanation or logic can be 
applied to this architectural phenomenon, in which the roof seems 
to explode, creating a sense of catastrophe wholly at odds with the 
staid conservatism usually associated with the legal profession. 
Even the materials are jarring, conflicting violently with the nine¬ 
teenth-century apartment building below. The planarity of the 


forms may suggest Constructivist sculpture, but the design lacks 
the clarity, structure, and logic of the Russian movement. The 
project is devoid of historicist and architectural references. 
Replacing order and logic is a sense of slashing, thrusting, tilting, 
fragmentation, and skewing. Yet these attributes are not about 
destruction, demolition, dismantling, or disaster. Rather, the 
architects aspired to disrupt preconceived notions of architecture. 

ZAHA HADID Zaha Hadid (b. 1950) is the one artist who is on 
everyone’s list of Deconstructivist architects, although she has lit¬ 
tle interest in Derrida and claims her work is not based in theory, 
but instead is intuitive. Born in Iraq and trained and based in 
London, she was heavily influenced by the energized geometric 
forms of Suprematism (see pages 966-69). Hadid s projects gener¬ 
ally show her concern for creating easily perceived fluid spaces 
that encourage people to come into and move about her structures. 

In the Lois and Richard Rosenthal Center for Contemporary 
Art in Cincinnati (fig. 30.8), which opened in 2003, broad shifting 
Suprematist-like planes and Constructivist-like boxes move up

and down and in and out on the museums facade. Hadid 
describes the facade as an “Urban Carpet,” and in fact, the side¬ 
walk curves slowly upward into the building, encouraging people 
to enter. The ground floor is a landscaped lobby, serving as an 
enclosed park, further attracting visitors. It is dominated by a 
dramatic series of lobby ramps that run the length of the entire 
space. The ramps lead to a mezzanine that opens onto galleries. 
The galleries and their shapes are visible from the street, further 
enticing the public to enter the museum. Because the museum 
does not have a permanent collection and only mounts temporary 
exhibits, Hadid designed a wide range of spaces to accommodate 
all kinds of art objects. The galleries appear to be suspended in 
space, floating on a variety of levels. This sense of energized 
fluidity, not only within the museum but also in the relationship 
of the street and sidewalk with the building, is one of the hall¬ 
marks of Hadid s work. 

FRANK CEHRY Frank Gehry (b. 1929) was also one of the seven 
architects included in the 1988 Deconstructivism show, but he 
views himself as an independent, refusing to be associated with 
any style or group. Nevertheless, his projects share with Coop 
Himmelblau s rooftop office a sense of disorder, fragmentation, 
and energy, as seen in his most famous project, the Guggenheim 
Museum, Bilbao (fig. 30.9). Its unique forms and vocabulary 
make it impossible to establish any specific meaning or architec¬ 
tural references. People have described the building s forms as a 
boat, a fish, and a blossoming flower—Gehry s own descrip¬ 
tion—but ultimately the structure is an exploration of the abstract 


sculptural play of enormous volumes, and it shows clearly the 
architect s pure delight in architectural freedom. 

The building s curvilinear masses are contrary to orthodox 
Deconstructivism, which emphasizes flat planes and angularity. 
Gehry designed their complex forms using computer technology, 
an integral tool in the fabrication of the building as well. (See 
Materials and Techniques , page 1085.) The museum even feels Hi¬ 
Tech, for covering the steel skeleton is a thin skin made up of 
thousands of tiny titanium shingles. These shimmer in the light, 
changing color—silver, blue, gold—as the time of day or the 
weather changes. The interior is equally spectacular. A handful of 
conventional, rectilinear rooms containing modern art (that is, art 
made before 1960) contrast with large, irregularly shaped galleries 
that accommodate contemporary works. One such space is the 
so-called boat gallery, a long corridor created by two massive 
concave walls. Perhaps the most sensational area is the vast 
entrance atrium. Crisscrossed by catwalks and lined with elevator 
cages, it contains spiraling ribbons of piers and opens up to a sea 
of windows and skylights. 

The Guggenheim, Bilbao is an example of the architectural 
diversity that had emerged by the end of the twentieth century, 
when all rules about design were suspended. As important, it 
reflects how architecture has moved beyond just being about 
designing buildings. Architects have, once again, begun to create 
prominent symbols for a city. From its conception, the museum 
was intended to be more than just a museum; it was meant to 
change the image of this Spanish industrial port, giving it cultural 
cachet and transforming it into a tourist destination. That is

Computer-Aided Design in Architecture 


I n the early 1 990s, architects began using CAD (computer-aided design) 
to create their buildings. In the “paperless studio,” plans were devel¬ 
oped using computer programs. This approach to design was initially 
quite controversial, since it forsook the age-old intuitive process of 
creating by putting hand to paper or modeling with wood or cardboard. 

Frank Gehry used a CAD program to produce the extremely compli¬ 
cated forms of the Guggenheim, Bilbao, and without this advanced 
technology, the structure and its titanium veneer probably would have 
been difficult to achieve, or at least the building would have been pro¬ 
hibitively expensive. The CAD program that Gehry, with his associate 
Him Glymph, selected is called CATIA, originally developed by 
Dessault Systems of France to digitally design and precisely produce 
extremely complicated products, such as airplane wings and fuselages 
for the French aerospace industry. 

Perhaps more important for Gehry and Glymph than facilitating the 
design, CATIA made the fabrication possible. Without CATIA, Gehry 
would have had to hand his plans over to artisans and workers, who 
then would have been challenged to translate them precisely into 
three-dimensional forms, a daunting if not impossible task. (Frank 
Lloyd Wright had tremendous difficulty finding a contractor willing to 
build his highly irregular, organic Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 
New York.) Instead, Gehry and Glymph sent computer files to fabrica¬ 
tors, who fed the digitized information into computer-robotic equip¬ 
ment that then manufactured the forms. Every detailed component of 
the building could be produced this way, from each unique, oddly 



Computer-generated diagram of the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain 


shaped window to each irregular titanium slate. CATIA also kept costs 
down. It no longer mattered that large segments of the building were 
uniquely sized and shaped and therefore could not be cost-effectively 
mass-produced. The computer program could manufacture each 
unique product with virtually the same expediency and cost as those 
of a Modernist building that has thousands of uniform windows and 
I-beams. 


precisely what happened: Gehry designed one of the seminal 
buildings of the twentieth century, a satellite of Frank Lloyd 
Wrights sensational 1950s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 
New York (see figs. 1.16 and 1.17), which it rivals in audacity and 
individuality. 

POST-MINIMALISM AND PLURALISM: 
LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES IN FINE ART 

Beginning in the late 1960s, the Post-Minimalists had rejected the 
austerity of Minimalism (see pages 1058-69) and once again 
returned the human figure, the artist s hand, subjectivity, and ref¬ 
erences back to art. The reaction to Minimalism was accompanied 
by the rise of a broad range of issues, styles, and mediums in the 
1970s. During the 1980s, this pluralism began to gain widespread 
acceptance as it moved from marginalized art to the mainstream. 
At the same time, Postmodern theory provided a philosophical 
basis for pluralism, as it argued against all authoritative aesthetics 
and philosophical positions. The Modernist notion that one and 
only one style was correct and could move art forward at any 
given moment was dead. Indeed, if a single word could encapsu¬ 
late the art made since the 1980s, it would be “diverse.” The art 
market, too, became truly global, with artists from every continent 


developing individual styles expressing a wide range of subjects in 
almost limitless mediums. Art s complexity now made it difficult 
to comfortably place an artist in a single category or hang a label 
on her or him. 

Among the many developments of the last 30 years are a 
revival of interest in painting and the ascendance of installation 
art, photography, and video as leading mediums. Among the more 
popular themes are racial, ethnic, and gender identity, a preoccu¬ 
pation with the body and death, and a Postmodern analysis, or 
Deconstruction, of how images and art take on meaning. But if 
there is anything that unites this period, it is the belief that 
Modernism with its authoritarian posturing is dead, and that the 
possibilities of what art can be and be about are limitless. 

The Return of Painting 

Painting was back by 1980. Not that it had ever disappeared, but 
in the late 1960s and 1970s it had been overshadowed by 
Conceptual, Video, Performance, and Earth Art, for example. The 
Postmodern art critics of the late 1970s associated painting with 
Modernism and were talking about “the death of painting,” even 
though a stream of shows featuring the medium opened in 
London, New York, Germany, and Italy in the period. In the 
introduction to his book about paintings revival, The 


CHAPTER 30 THE POSTMODERN ERA: ART SINCE 1 980 1 085 


MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES 








International Trans-av ant garde (1982), critic Achille Bonito Oliva 
wrote, “The dematerialization of the work and the impersonality 
of execution which characterized the art of the seventies, along 
strictly Duchampian lines, are being overcome by the reestablish¬ 
ment of manual skill through a pleasure of execution which brings 
the tradition of painting back into art. ” Another staunch advocate 
of painting, Christos Joachimides, in the introduction to the cata¬ 
logue for his 1981 London show, A New Spirit in Painting , lauded 
the medium because now “Subjectivity, the visionary, myth, suf¬ 
fering and grace have all been rehabilitated.” The demand for 
painting was fueled by an explosion of personal and corporate 
wealth in the 1980s in America, western Europe, and Japan, espe¬ 
cially driven in America by the takeovers and mergers encouraged 
by Reaganomics. As the recession of the 1970s and early 1980s 
ended, demand grew for art that could be bought and hung on a 
collector’s wall or in a corporate lobby. 

The new type of painting that emerged came to be known as 
Neo-Expressionism, an appropriate label for works that are often 
both painterly and expressionistic, although not always, which 
makes the term problematic, along with the fact that the range of 
issues these artists deal with are quite broad in range and unre¬ 
lated. The painting labeled Neo-Expressionist appeared first in 
Germany and Italy in the 1970s and then migrated to New York. 
In Germany, painters self-consciously recalled the Northern 
Romanticism and Expressionism so deeply ingrained in that 


nations culture. Joseph Beuys (see page 1063), through his mys¬ 
tical performances, was the catalyst for this resurrection of the 
German past. Among the themes he and other artists began to 
explore was the legacy of Hitler’s Third Reich. 

ANSELM KIEFER Among Beuyss students at the Dusseldorf 
Art Academy was Anselm Kiefer (b. 1945). Kiefer created images 
of mythical themes and epic scope that evoke centuries of German 
history, as seen in his enormous painting To the Unknown Painter 
(fig. 30.10). The picture explodes with the energy of flailed paint 
and the dramatic perspective of crop furrows rushing toward an 
eerie monumental tomb. Cold, bleak, and lifeless, this largely col¬ 
orless image, except for shots of blood-red, seems to exude an 
atmosphere of death. Or does it? Crops lying fallow in the winter 
will be reborn in the spring, and the cycle of life continues. 
Kiefer’s expressive use of paint and dramatic composition can be 
interpreted as a metaphor for the constant movement and forces 
of nature. Inspired by Beuyss use of symbolic objects, Kiefer 
often incorporated real materials into his paintings, imbuing them 
with a similar ritualistic magic. In this work, he embedded straw 
into the paint, and viewers could smell its scent for years. Nature 
is not just illustrated, it is physically present. 

The focus of the image is the tomb, a mausoleum for painters, 
as suggested by the title. We can assume the painters are German 
because the tomb is not painted but rendered in a large woodcut,

a medium associated with German art since being widely used by 
northern European artists during the Renaissance as well as by the 
Expressionists in the early twentieth century (see page 958). The 
bunkerlike shape suggests a shelter, and the isolated but well- 
anchored monument seems to be surrounded by the swirling 
forces of nature, representing not only the German mythical past 
but also the Romantic spirit that has driven German artists for 
centuries. We know from other works by Kiefer that these 
destructive forces are meant to symbolize Hitler s perversion of 
the German Romantic tradition, which he manipulated to serve 
his racist agenda and justify the suppression of avant-garde German 
artists, whom the Nazis labeled “Degenerates” (see page 1031). 

In a painting about national identity, Kiefer s Expressionist 
style and use of Romantic themes proclaim his place within the 
northern European Romantic tradition. He assures us that this 
tradition is once again in safe hands. With its wealth of symbols, 
metaphors, and overlapping and interlocking interpretations, the 
resulting image is varied and complex, reflecting the epic scale 
Kiefer covers and the mythical themes he evokes. 

JULIAN SCHNABEL The artist who became emblematic of 
Neo-Expressionism in America is Julian Schnabel (b. 1953), a 
New Yorker raised in Texas, where he went to the University of 
Houston. While today perhaps better known by the general pub¬ 
lic for his films, such as The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), 
Schnabel dominated the New York art world in the 1980s, or, as 
one critic put it, he “created a bonfire over Manhattan,” which he 
ignited with a 1981 exhibition that was so large it was held at both 
the Leo Castelli Gallery, the premier blue-chip gallery, and the 


Mary Boone Gallery, the hottest new gallery in town. Everything 
about Schnabel was oversize, including his ego, reflected in such 
statements as “I’m the closest thing to Picasso.” His paint surfaces 
are enormous, 16 feet in one direction not being unusual, and 
range from traditional canvas, to Kabuki backdrops, to tarpaulins, 
to animal skins, to the disreputable black velvet found in gas- 
station art. Often, his pictures are encased in extremely ornate and 
wide baroque frames. He covers his surfaces with violent, crude¬ 
looking, and dramatic slathers of paint, as well as with objects of 
all kinds, including broken crockery, for which he became espe¬ 
cially renowned, the skeleton of a fir tree, and antlers, as seen here 
in his 1980 painting The Exile (fig. 30.11). Demonstrating a 
Postmodern penchant to raid the art of the past and present, as 
well as popular culture, his motifs are often appropriated, as is the 
figure holding a fruit basket in Exile , which was taken from a 
painting by Caravaggio. Despite the bombast, there is no point in 
trying to interpret Schnabel s picture, since there is no narrative to 
be found in the Caravaggio figure, the spool-like diagrammatic 
doll, the bearded man, the antlers, and the often odd tradings of 
paint. The inspiration for Schnabel s appropriation of objects and 
images that are juxtaposed in no particular narrative is Sigmar 
Polke (see fig. 29.17), whose work Schnabel saw in Europe in the 
1970s. Like Polke, Schnabel s painting exudes a mood, rather than 
a story. In The Exile , we can sense the eruptive gestures and vital¬ 
ity of the artist locking horns with death, as evoked by the life- 
lessness of the appropriated figures and the sad, one-eyed doll, 
and, of course, the antlers themselves, the remains of once-living 
animals. As expressed by the artist, his paintings “are icons that 
present life in terms of our death.” Although he is Jewish, his 


CHAPTER 30 THE POSTMODERN ERA: ART SINCE 1 980 1 087 





imagery is often Catholic, the crucified Christ being one favorite 
motif. While reflecting his personal experience as a student at a 
Catholic school in Brownsville, Texas, this kind of imagery is 
hardly spiritual, instead reinforcing a sense of physical suffering, 
loss, and isolation that haunts his baroque pictures. 

JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT AND GRAFFITI ART Of the 

many American Neo-Expressionists to emerge in the 1980s, 
among the most exciting was Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988). 
Born in New York to a middle-class family, Basquiat s father was 
Haitian and his mother was of Puerto Rican descent. He dropped 
out of school at age 17, first writing poetry and then becoming a 
street artist using the tag name SAMO, suggesting the phrase 
"same old.” By studying art books, he became knowledgeable 
about art history and began painting. By the time he was 22, he 
had achieved international stardom. He died of a drug overdose 
at age 27. 

In Horn Players (fig. 30.12) of 1983, Basquiat combines both 
poetry and graffiti. More important, he draws upon the lessons of 


the pluralistic 1970s by brilliantly incorporating the eras strate¬ 
gies of using texts, making process art, working with narratives, 
and dealing with social politics, here racial identity. Basquiat also 
owes a debt to Abstract Expressionism, seen in his dynamic han¬ 
dling of paint, and to Pop Art, visible in his cartoonlike imagery 
and popular-culture references. 

Basquiat was prolific, working quickly and with the stream- 
of-consciousness intensity sensed here. We can feel him painting, 
writing, crossing out. He draws us into the canvas by forcing 
us to read and piece it together. He makes us experience the 
sounds coming out of the saxophone, think about the repetition 
of words and the rhythms they make, and analyze his masterful 
use of color—a brilliant pink and blue here, yellow and green 
there. Because they are so powerfully presented, we cannot 
dismiss Basquiat s use of words such as "alchemy,” a reference to 
the alchemy of jazz, "ornithology,” a nod to jazz musician 
Charlie Parker, nicknamed "Bird,”, and "ear,” an allusion to 
musical instinct. His works evoke the raw energy of the 1950s— 
Beat poetry, improvisational jazz, and Abstract Expressionism.

But 1980s hip-hop also comes to mind. Like Schnabel, Basquiat 
appropriates motifs, styles, and ideas from different periods— 
a hallmark of Postermodernism. This approach allows him to 
create a powerful, sensuous experience as he shares his passionate 
feelings about the black musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie 
Parker, with whom he clearly identifies. Much of his work 
features African-American musicians, singers, and athletes, and is 
a reflection of the importance artists were increasingly giving to 
racial, ethnic, and gender identities, as will be discussed below. 

ELIZABETH MURRAY AND NEW IMAGE PAINTING In 1978, the 
Whitney Museum of American Art in New York mounted an 
exhibition of American artists entitled New Image Painting. The 
show not only claimed that painting was alive and well, it heralded 
the arrival of a new kind of painting, one that had representational 
objects embedded within seemingly abstract paintings. At the 
time, Elizabeth Murray (1940-2007) was producing totally 
abstract work and was not included in the exhibition. But within 
a few years, she had begun adding representational components to 
her abstractions. Because of their associations, these recognizable 
elements served as metaphors for a psychological state. Murray s 
evolution to referential abstraction can be seen in More Than You 
Know (fig. 30.13) of 1983. At a glance, the painting appears to 
consist of entirely abstract shapes. But we soon realize that the 


sweeping organic curve playing off a blue-gray Constructivist 
rectangle is the back of a spindleback chair. We then recognize the 
mostly gray rectangle as a painting hanging on a yellow wall. 
Finally, the green anthropomorphic shape evolves into a table 
with collapsed legs. On the table lie a white form resembling a 
piece of paper and a disturbing biomorphic shape that recalls the 
skull in Munch s The Scream (see fig. 26.19). Tension dominates 
the image, symbolized by the collapsed table as well as the strident 
colors, the unfinished-looking paint handling, and the violent tilt 
of the floor. Even the shape of the painting is frenzied. Murray 
combines ten canvases, overlapping them and producing a ragged 
profile that transforms the painting into a wildly spinning 
pinwheel. Nothing seems to be anchored in this composition as 
objects shift like detritus adrift in a stormy sea. In her three- 
dimensional, heaving paintings, Murray continually focuses on 
the psychological tension of daily life, the edgy reality that lies 
beneath the facade of domestic harmony. Because her work often 
deals with the psychology of the home as experienced from a 
womans viewpoint, many critics place her within the context of 
feminist art. In any case, her work reflects the increasing interest 
in womens issues that characterize the 1980s. 

Sculpture 

The Post-Minimal aesthetic in sculpture, which combined the 
geometry of Minimalism with references and emotion that we 
saw in the work of Eva Hesse and Richard Serra (see pages 
1058-59), continued unabated into the 1980s and 1990s. It could 
appear in such diverse forms as beautifully crafted, mysterious 
objects, as in the work of Martin Puryear, or readily understood 
public monuments, as in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial by 
Maya Lin. 

MARTIN PURYEAR One of the many outstanding sculptors 
who made objects rather than installations is Martin Puryear 
(b. 1941). Puryear fulfills in sculpture “the reestablishment of 
manual skill through a pleasure of execution,” as the critic Oliva 
had said about painting. After serving in the Peace Corps in the 
West African nation of Sierra Leone, studying printmaking and 
woodworking in Sweden, and visiting Japan, Puryear settled in 
Brooklyn in 1973, where he soon emerged, by the 1980s becom¬ 
ing a leading sculptor of his generation. 

One of the first things we notice in his 1985 wood and steel 
sculpture The Spell (fig. 30.14) is his craftsmanship. We marvel at 
the beauty of the curved shapes, the elegant tapering of the cone, 
the playful variety of its rectangular openings, and the sensuous 
texture of the flat, striated wood strips that make up the “web¬ 
bing” of what looks like a basket. The allusion to basket making 
suggests crafts and craftsmanship, which in turn implies a human 
presence—we sense the hand that carefully constructed this 
object, unlike Minimal Art, which seemed mass-produced and 
machine-made. We also sense Puryear s background not only in 
Africa, where he would have seen magnificently crafted utilitarian 
and ceremonial wooden objects, but also in Sweden, where he

trained in woodworking, and in Japan, a culture with a long tra¬ 
dition of crafting wood into functional and decorative objects. It 
would be a mistake, however, to interpret Puryear s references to 
African art as just an acknowledgment of his African-American 
background. His sculpture is generally not about ethnic identity 
and politics, although there are exceptions, but instead it reflects 
his broader experiences in diverse cultures well versed in using 
wood as an artistic medium. 

The Spell defies interpretation. Resembling a trap lying on the 
floor, the sculpture appears to be utilitarian but is not. Despite its 
title, suggestive of mystery and sorcery, there is nothing clearly 
ritualistic or shamanistic about the work. Rather, we sense the 
essence of the wood itself, and therefore the sculpture evokes 
nature. Yet it is the human component—the craftsmanship—that 
prevails. Like Eva Hesse, but working in a radically different 
style, Puryear transforms the austerity of Minimalist geometry 
into an enigmatic yet warm organic object loaded with powerful 
human allusions. 

MAYA LIN One of the best-known Post-Minimal sculptures of 
the 1980s is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (fig. 30.15) by Maya Lin 
(b. 1959). Lin received the commission while still a student in the 
architecture program at Yale University. A daunting project because 
of the strong emotions and opinions surrounding the Vietnam 
War, Lin s solution proved beautiful in its simplicity, ingenious in 
its neutrality, and sublime in its emotional impact. Lin presents

Cindy Sherman (b. 1954) 

From an interview 

In these excerpts from a 1988 interview with Jeanne Siegel , Sherman 

discusses the role-playing in her photographs. 

CINDY SHERMAN: I still wanted to make a filmic sort of image, but I 
wanted to work alone. I realized that I could make a picture of a 
character reacting to something outside the frame so that the viewer 
would assume another person. 

Actually, the moment that I realized how to solve this problem 
was when Robert [Longo] and I visited David Salle, who had been 
working for some sleazy detective magazine. Bored as I was, wait¬ 
ing for Robert and David to get their “art talk” over with, I noticed 
all these 8 by 10 glossies from the magazine which triggered some¬ 
thing in me. (I was never one to discuss issues—after all, at that time 
I was “the girlfriend. ”) 

JEANNE SIEGEL: In the “Untitled Film Stills,” what was the influence 
of real film stars? It seems that you had a fascination with European 
stars. You mentioned Jeanne Moreau, Brigitte Bardot, and Sophia 
Loren in some of your statements. Why were you attracted to them? 

CS: I guess because they weren’t glamorized like American starlets. 
When I think of American actresses from the same period, I think 
of bleached blonde, bejeweled, and furred sex bombs. But, when I 
think of Jeanne Moreau and Sophia Loren, I think of more vulner¬ 
able, lower-class types of characters, more identifiable as working- 
class women. 

At that time I was trying to emulate a lot of different types of 
characters. I didn’t want to stick to just one. I’d seen a lot of the 
movies that these women had been in but it wasn’t so much that I 


was inspired by the women as by the films themselves and the feel¬ 
ings in the films. 

JS: And what is the relationship between your “Untitled Film Stills” 
and the real film stills? 

CS: In real publicity film stills from the 40s and 50s something usually 
sexy/cute is portrayed to get people to go see the movie. Or the 
woman could be shown screaming in terror to publicize a horror film. 

My favorite film images (where obviously my work took its 
inspiration) didn’t have that. They’re closer to my own work for that 
reason, because both are about a sort of brooding character caught 
between the potential violence and sex. However, I’ve realized it is 
a mistake to make that kind of literal connection because my work 
loses in the comparison. I think my characters are not quite taken in 
by their roles so that they couldn’t really exist in any of their so- 
called “films,” which, next to a real still, looks unconvincing. They 
are too aware of the irony of their role and perhaps that’s why many 
have puzzled expressions. My “stills” were about the fakeness of 
role-playing as well as contempt for the domineering “male” audi¬ 
ence who would mistakenly read the images as sexy. ... 

JS: Another critical issue attached to the work was the notion that the 
stereotypical view was exclusively determined by the “male” gaze. 
Did you see it only in this light or did it include the woman seeing 
herself as well? 

CS: Because I’m a woman I automatically assume other women would 
have an immediate identification with the roles. And I hoped men 
would feel empathy for the characters as well as shedding light on 
their role-playing. What I didn’t anticipate was that some people 
would assume that I was playing up to the male gaze. I can under¬ 
stand the criticism of feminists who therefore assumed I was 
reinforcing the stereotype of woman as victim or as sex object.

the names of the dead and missing in action in a chronological 
list from 1959 to 1975. The names are etched into slabs of black 
granite that carve out a V-shaped gash in the earth. Viewers start 
reading from the left, representing the year 1959, where the first 
killed are listed and the granite rises out of the ground. The name¬ 
laden stone gradually rises along its 247-foot (75.2-m) length as 
more and more Americans die. The names keep coming, and the 
viewer soon becomes emotionally overwhelmed by their number. 

At its 10-foot peak, the granite turns at a 130-degree angle and 
then descends along another 247-foot length, with fewer soldiers 
listed as the 1973 withdrawal from Vietnam approaches. At the 
end, as the granite again disappears into the ground, many view¬ 
ers are left with a feeling of existential nothingness. Adding to this 
sense of loss is the impact of the granite s polished surface, which 
acts like a mirror casting reflections of the living onto the names 
of the dead. This memorial is a sharp departure from traditional 
representational monuments to heroism, like Rude’s La 
Marseillaise (see fig. 24.27), which glorified nationalistic spirit 
and dedication. In a sense, the granite wall acts as an enormous 
tombstone. While the monument takes the form of Minimal 
sculpture, and like Minimal sculpture was manufactured, it has 


been transformed through references into a brilliant Postmodern 
monument of powerful emotions. 

APPROPRIATION ART: 
DECONSTRUCTING IMAGES 

While painting and sculpture were exciting the art world in the 
first half of the 1980s and garnering the bulk of the attention, 
more and more artists came under the spell of Postmodern ideas. 
These artists turned to photography, video, film, billboards, and 
LED (light-emitting diode) boards, that is, mediums associated 
with the mass media. Rarely did they make paintings, which were 
identified with Modernism, although Julian Schnabel’s appropri¬ 
ated images that he put into a new context, thus changing their 
meaning, could just as easily be discussed in this section as under 
Neo-Expressionism. This new generation of artists began to 
deconstruct the visual world, exploring how images, which 
include three-dimensional objects, function largely to establish 
power, prestige, and value, but also demonstrating how objects 
take on meaning in general. This Postmodern questioning parsed 


CHAPTER 30 THE POSTMODERN ERA: ART SINCE 1 980 1 091 


OUR 



image making, exposing hidden agendas or hierarchies, and 
demystifying the authority of the image. Feminist theory especially 
propelled this Postmodernist art, as large numbers of women artist 
explored how women were presented in the media, and for whom. 

Photography and LED Signs 

While October magazine played a major role in introducing 
Postmodern theory to American artists, an exhibition titled 
Pictures , presented in 1977 at Artists Space, an alternative gallery 
in lower Manhattan, was also instrumental in bringing Post¬ 
modernism to the art worlds attention. The art in the show 
consisted largely of pictures, both paintings and photographs, 
that were appropriations of preexisting images, thus demonstrat¬ 
ing how all pictures, to varying degrees, are based on earlier art 
and calling into question such issues as originality, uniqueness, 
and authorship in art. Sherrie Levine, one of the artists in the 
exhibition, soon after became notorious for making photographs 
of photographs by such major male artists as Edward Weston 
and Walker Evans (see pages 1023 and 1029) and drawings of 
drawings by Joan Miro and Piet Mondrian (see pages 996 and 
1005). Her copies, or re-presentations, called into question how 
art takes on value and the importance granted to the original 
artist, who, himself, was always borrowing from predecessors. 
In effect, Levine was declaring that no art was new. Furthermore, 
Levine re-presented the work of men, her appropriations under¬ 
lining the status accorded male artists. Not only did many of 
the early appropriation artists work in photography, but many, 
such as Cindy Sherman, Louise Lawler, Barbara Kruger, and 
Laurie Simmons, were women, who often dealt with womens 
issues. By the end of the 1980s, Neo-Expressionism was on 
the wane, overtaken by Deconstruction, much of which was 
photography. 

BARBARA KRUGER If anyone knows how the mass media 
operates, it is Barbara Kruger (b. 1945), who has a background in 
graphic design at the magazines Mademoiselle and House and 
Garden. Kruger appropriates photographs from magazines, 
which she re-presents in gelatin silver prints, often quite large, 
with wording across the image, similar to the wording in advertis¬ 
ing. Over the frontally presented head of an attractive woman, for 
example, she put “Your body is a battleground,” a reference to the 
abortion debate engulfing the nation in the 1980s as Jerry 
Falwell s Moral Majority ramped up the attack on Roe vs. Wade, 
the 1973 supreme court decision upholding the right to abortion. 
Over the image of a stone sculpture bust of a woman seen in pro¬ 
file she placed “Your gaze hits the side of my head,” a reference to 
art being made specifically for the male gaze, as described in 
Jacques Lacan s psychoanalytic theories, with women being pre¬ 
sented for male pleasure. This same theme is presented in Untitled 
(We Won't Play Nature to Your Culture) (fig. 30.16). The woman 
does not have the power of the gaze for she is blinded, not because 
she is stone, but here because her eyes are covered with leaves. By 
using words such as “we” and “our” versus “you” and “your,”

Your Culture). 1983. Photograph, 73 x 49" (185 xl24 cm.)

Kruger sets up a dichotomy between the maker/manipulator of 
the image on the one hand, and the target/manipulated on the 
other. Besides the male/female dichotomy, Kruger sets up a 
nature/culture opposition, “nature” referring to the neutral state 
of nature, and “culture” to the two-dimensional visual image in 
which one person s agenda is imposed on another. 

Krugers deconstruction not only reflects European 
Postmodernism, it is also driven by a dramatic increase in feminist 
theory in general, which appeared in such journals as Camera 
Obscura and Differences. The feminist movement also produced 
a journal specifically for feminist art, Heresies , started in 1976. 
The late 1970s and 1980s saw an enormous increase in women 
artists dealing with feminist issues. Among the most vociferous 
and effective was a collaborative called the Guerrilla Girls, 
founded in New York in 1985 and with cells throughout the 
United States. They produced printed matter, especially posters, 
and gave presentations, wearing gorilla masks, a feminist ploy 


1092 PART IV THE MODERN WORLD 





meant to undermine the Modernist emphasis on the individual 
artist and shift focus to the issues. They especially spotlighted 
how women were marginalized by the art establishment. Among 
their more famous posters is one made in 1989 presenting Ingres s 
Grande Odalisque (see fig. 24.13) wearing a gorilla mask, above 
which is printed “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. 
Museum? Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections 
are women, but 85% of the nudes are female.” The Guerilla Girls 
are confrontational interventionists, taking their art out of the 
gallery and to the public by plastering their posters and billboards 
in public places, often around museums and galleries that they 
were viciously critiquing. Kruger as well on occasion has worked 
in the public domain, using billboards. 

CINDY SHERMAN AND THE UNTITLED FILM STILL 

While Kruger and the Gorilla Girls appropriate the propagandis¬ 
ts look and power of advertising, Cindy Sherman (b. 1954) 
focuses more on how film structures identity and sexuality. She is 
also interested in revealing how viewers impose meaning on 
images. Beginning in 1977, Sherman began a series called Untitled 
Film Stills , in which she photographed herself in situations that 
resemble stills from B movies. For each, she created a set and a 
female character that she played herself, wearing different clothes, 
wigs, and accouterments so that she is unrecognizable as the same 



person from one 10-by-8-inch still to the next. It is conceptually 
important that she is always the actress, for her metamorphosis 
represents the transformation women undergo subliminally as 
they conform to societal stereotypes reinforced, if not actually 
determined, by the mass media. In Untitled Film Still #15, 
Sherman plays the “sexy babe” who seems to be anxiously await¬ 
ing the arrival of a date or lover (fig. 30 . 17 ). But is this really what 
is happening? Sherman leaves the viewer guessing. She may sug¬ 
gest a narrative, but in her untitled works, she never provides 
enough information to securely determine one. In effect, the story 
a viewer imagines says more about their own backgrounds, expe¬ 
riences, and attitudes than it does about the picture itself, which 
remains ambiguous. Her “babe” could very well be dressed for a 
costume party instead of a date, and her look of concern could be 
for something occurring on the street below. Innumerable stories 
can be spun from this image, taking into account such details as 
her cross pendant or the spindleback chair and exposed-brick 
wall, which seem to conflict with her youth and the lifestyle her 
clothing suggests. Remove any one of these motifs, and the story 
would change. Through what seems a simple strategy, Sherman 
brilliantly reveals the complex ways in which images become 
invested with meaning and how we are programmed by the media 
to interpret them. (See Primary Source, page 1091.) 

JENNY HOLZER AND LED BOARDS Like Kruger and 
Sherman, Jenny Holzer (b. 1950) works in the very medium she 
wants to expose. For Holzer, the target is the advertising slogan 
that passes as truth. In 1977, she began writing what she calls 
“truisms,” which she printed on posters, flyers, T-shirts, and hats. 
Eventually, she moved on to electronic signs, even using the big 
electronic board in New York s Times Square in 1982. In the mid- 
1980s, she began working with LED boards, the medium with 
which she is now most associated. Holzer s truisms were home- 
spun aphorisms, one-liners that express a broad range of attitudes 
and biases, such as “Murder has its sexual side,” “Raise boys 
and girls the same way,” “Any surplus is immoral,” and “Morality 
is for little people.” In effect, she presents either side of the “us 
versus you” conflict exposed by Kruger, but the impact is the 
same. Her works provoke an awareness that one person is trying 
to impose a position on another. Holzer created the installation 
of truisms reproduced here (fig. 30 . 18 ) for the Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum in 1989. LED boards run up the side of 
museums spiral ramp, while below, arranged in a ritualistic circle, 
are benches with truisms etched on their seats. Wherever visitors 
turn, they are being talked to, and in a sense, manipulated, 
harangued, preached to, and controlled. Left unanswered, how¬ 
ever, are such questions as: What is the truth? And who is talking, 
and for whom?

Context and Meaning in Art: The Institutional 
Critique and Art as Commodity 

Not all Postmodern artists deconstructed the mass media. Some, 
such as Fred Wilson, used appropriation to explore how museums 
control meaning and manipulate visitors, which we have already 
seen the Guerrilla Girls doing as well. Others, such as Jeff Koons, 
scavenged images from mass culture, especially nonart kitsch 
objects, and transformed them into high art. By putting the work 
in a high-art context, Koons demonstrates how art functions, how 
it differs from popular culture, and how taste is fashioned. 

THE INSTITUTIONAL CRITIQUE! FRED WILSON Fred 
Wilson (b. 1954) is a New York Conceptual artist who generally 
works with found objects that he puts into new contexts in order 
to reveal the hidden meanings or agendas of their previous uses. 
Or, as he himself said, “I get everything that satisfies my soul 
from bringing together objects that are in the world, manipulat¬ 
ing them, working with spatial arrangements, and having things 


presented in the way I want to see them.” He is especially 
renowned for deconstructing museums, that is, reinstalling collec¬ 
tions to reveal how museums have an agenda when they present 
art and how the interpretation of this art can change when it is put 
into a new context. His most famous work is titled Mining the 
Museum (fig. 30.19), a commission from the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Baltimore. For this project, Wilson 
“mined” the collection of the nearby Maryland Historical Society, 
pulling works out of storage that probably had not seen the light 
of day in decades, and then inserting them into existing installa¬ 
tions, the new item creating a new context for the display and 
powerfully deconstructing the original objects. Wilson, for exam¬ 
ple, uncovered slave manacles in storage, which he then inserted 
in a case of fine silver. Silver pitchers, teapots, and goblets, which 
had been presented as examples of superb craftsmanship and 
design, were now seen as valuable commodities, their production 
and acquisition made possible by the proceeds of slave labor. The 
manacles also raised a second issue, which is that without the 
manacles, African Americans, who constitute as large portion of

Baltimore s populace, would not be represented at all in the 
museum. The unadorned, painfully functional manacles sit in 
powerful contrast to the glistening polished silver, creating a new 
context that radically undermines the story formerly told by the 
historical society. 

ART AS COMMODITY! JEFF KOONS Unlike Wilson, Jeff 
Koons (b. 1955) makes objects, although he does not do the 
work himself, preferring to contract out the actual labor. But he 
likewise scavenges objects and images in order to explore the 


relationship of fine art, often sculpture, to mass culture. Fie is 
particularly interested in issues of taste and how art functions as a 
commodity Despite making objects, Koons is basically a 
Conceptual artist, and the wealth of his ideas drives the diverse 
styles and mediums in which he works. Fie continuously pushes 
the limits of sculpture, creating objects that range from Fioover 
vacuum cleaners presented in Plexiglas boxes to stainless-steel 
train cars filled with bourbon based on actual Jim Beam train cars, 
and from a rabbit-shaped chrome balloon to a 43-foot-tall puppy 
made of flowers. 

Entirely different is the ceramic sculpture Michael Jackson and 
Bubbles (fig. 30.20) of 1988. Like a Warhol print, the sculpture 
was factory-produced, made to Koons s specifications in a limited 
edition by craftsmen in Italy The image was not drawn or 
designed by the artist but rather chosen by him, in Duchampian 
fashion, from a publicity photograph of the singer with his pet 
chimpanzee, a process that on another occasion resulted in a 
copyright lawsuit against him. Its ornateness recalls seventeenth- 
century Italian Baroque sculpture (see Chapter 19) and eighteenth- 
century French porcelain, while the tawdry gold paint and rouged 
lips, along with the pop-culture imagery, give the work a crass look 
associated with mass-produced gift-shop figurines. Koons real¬ 
ized that by presenting his subject life-size, like a Classical sculp¬ 
ture of a Greek god, he was placing a mass-media image in the 
context of fine art, and giving it a new meaning. Fie transformed 
it from a kitsch souvenir into a compelling statement about what 
constitutes art, exploring the differences between fine art and “low” 
art. And because souvenirs are commodities, Koons reminds us 
that art, too, is merchandise. Again, with a hint of Warhol, Koons 
captures and parodies the glitz of celebrity promotion. But the 
tawdriness of the image and the porcelain medium give the sculp¬ 
ture a poignant sense of fragility and impermanence, suggesting

the temporary nature of life and fame. Koons rolls the influences 
of Duchamp, Warhol, and Postmodern deconstruction into one 
package and updates it for the consumption-oriented 1980s. 

MULTICULTURALISM AND 
POLITICAL ART 

We have looked at Fred Wilson within the context of appropria¬ 
tion, deconstruction, and the institutional critique, but we could 
have just as easily incorporated him in a section devoted to 
racial identity. Part and parcel of the Postmodern 1980s is the 
tremendous surge in art dealing with issues of race, ethnicity, 
gender, and sexual orientation, as well as a full range of social 
and economic issues. Goading many artists was the adversarial 
position of the neoconservativism of Ronald Reagan’s administra¬ 
tion (1981-89) and Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, founded in 
1979. Their extreme-right philosophy defeated the womens 
Equal Rights Amendment in 1982, sought to outlaw abortion, 
reduced funding for social welfare, and ignored the AIDS 
epidemic, which struck mostly gays, blacks, and Latinos. 

African-American Identity 

There are almost as many approaches to dealing with racial 
issues as there are artists. While Fred Wilson uses site-specific 
installation, others, like Lorna Simpson and Carrie-Mae Weems, 
use photography with text, like Kruger. In one of her best-known 
works, Cornered (1988), the Conceptual artist Adrien Piper used 
video installation. She barricaded a television monitor, draped 
in black cloth, in a corner of a room behind an upturned table. 
Above the monitor on the wall were two death certificates for her 
father, one describing him as white, the other as octoroon, that 
is, one-eight African-American. On the screen, Piper, well dressed 
and softly spoken, gives a 20-minute monologue describing how 
people become cornered due to stereotyping and labeling. 
Radically different is Conceptual artist David Hammons, whose 
work is often imbued with humor and takes place in the 
community. In contrast again, Kara Walker’s cut-paper silhouette 
wall drawings are charged with horror, exposing the conflicting 
feelings of hatred, lust, sadism, and fascination that lie beneath 
racial tensions. 

DAVID HAMMONS Emerging in the late 1960s, David 
Hammons (b. 1943) is a wonderfully quirky Conceptual artist 
who, for most of his career, shunned showing in prestigious gal¬ 
leries (he does now), often presenting his art surreptitiously in 
New York shops owned by friends, where customers would 
chance upon it while looking at the store s regular nonart mer¬ 
chandise. Or he creates work specifically for African-American 
communities, as is the case with Higher Goals (fig. 30.21) of 1982, 
originally installed in his Harlem neighborhood and here pho¬ 
tographed at a Brooklyn site. The sculpture was provoked by a 
group of neighborhood teenagers, who were playing basketball 


when they should have been attending school and who told the 
artist that the road to success lay in sports, not education. 

Hammons’ response was to design 40-foot-high basketball 
hoops decorated with wind chimes (which suggest native 
American spirit catchers meant to filter out bad dreams) and bot¬ 
tle caps, often associated with winos and thus wasted lives and 
arranged in colorful geometric patterns suggesting African motifs, 
designs, textiles, and beadwork. As stated in the title, the work is 
about setting realistic higher goals, such as getting an education, 
as opposed to unrealistic objectives, such as becoming a profes¬ 
sional basketball player, as suggested by the unreachable 40-foot- 
high baskets. Its brightly decorated objects have a ritualistic, even 
totemic quality, and they raise the issue of what is to be revered 
and where ancestral spirit is to be placed. While clearly humorous, 
Hammons’s works are extremely intellectual, although they com¬ 
municate at a “cool” accessible level with the neighborhood and 
in the neighborhood.

KARA WALKER Among the most sensational, and perhaps 
the most controversial, African-American artists to appear in 
recent years is Kara Walker (b. 1969), who emerged in 1994 fresh 
out of the M.F.A. program at the Rhode Island School of 
Design. Heavily influenced by her readings of such black feminist 
writers as Michele Wallace, Octavia Butler, and Toni Morrison, 
and especially the latters Tar Baby , Walker found her subject 
matter in African-American history and, often, in her feelings as 
a black woman living in racist America. Simultaneously, her 
research led her to nineteenth-century silhouette portraits, simple 
black cut-paper silhouettes of the sitter, made by privileged white 
girls as part of their education and by itinerant portraitists for 
clients who could not afford full-blown portraits, whether on 
paper or canvas. 

Walker exploded onto the New York art world in 1994 with a 
13-by-50-foot installation of life-size black cutouts titled Gone, 
An Historical Romance of a Civil War As It Occurred Between the 
Dusky Thighs of One Young Negress and Her Heart , presented at 
the Drawing Center, a not-for-profit space. The scene is set in the 
antebellum South, filled with moss-laden oaks that frame such 
vignettes as white lovers leaning together to kiss, a small male 
slave mysteriously strangling a bird that appears to emerge from 
the opened legs of a female slave while the sword of a white 
gentleman appears to pierce the backside of the boy, and a slave 
girl performing fellatio on a white man. By 2000, Walker was 
adding projected silhouettes and colored lighting to her cut-paper 
installations, as can be seen in Insurrection (Our Tools Were 


Rudimentary, Yet We Pressed On) (fig. 30.22), containing such 
lurid or unseemly events as a plantation owner surreptitiously 
propositioning a naked female slave behind a tree, a group of 
whites torturing a black, and a female slave, with a tiny baby on 
her head, trying to escape a lynching. Everything is exaggerated 
and caricatured, playing to stereotypes; many of the figures in her 
works are outright grotesques, having, for example, four legs or 
giant phalluses, thus hammering home the perversion and abnor¬ 
mality driving the emotions in her anecdotal, chimerical world. 
The cut paper is executed in unmitigated black, and the scene has 
the quality of a dream, actually a nightmare, its sense of violence, 
hysteria, and horror pushed to a feverish pitch by Walker s con¬ 
tours, which are jagged, spiky, and erupting with piercing sword- 
or daggerlike projections. This simple, detailless, flat, dark world 
seems to penetrate beneath the visual overload and superficiality 
of the fact-filled real world to expose the essence of human rela¬ 
tions—a frightening psychological realm where the basic human 
urges and emotions of sex, desire, hatred, cruelty, love, sodomy, 
masochism, bestiality, castration, murder, and lust are played out. 
Walker s world is not just that of the antebellum South, it is also 
the world of today, where fraught race relations still plague 
American society and racial, ethnic, and religious conflict steeps 
the world in perpetual conflict. For besides giving Insurrection an 
oneiric quality, the projections pull Walkers antebellum scene 
into the present, for the light casts shadows of the viewers on the 
wall, thereby integrating the present, us, into Walker s nightmare 
and making us complicit in this horrific timeless occurrence.

The AIDS Pandemic and a 
Preoccupation with the Body 

One of the most embattled fronts in the 1980s artistic war with 
right-wing politics was the struggle to bring about government 
support to deal with the AIDS epidemic, a disease of the immune 
system first identified in 1981 that to date has affected over 33 
million people worldwide. Triggered by ACT-UP, the acronym 
for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, artists, many gay, 
began making art dealing with the crisis of thousands of people 
dying while the government did nothing. Much of the art was 
made by groups, such as Gran Fury and Group Material, these 
collaborative artists being a reflection of the Postmodern rejection

bed). 1991. Billboard, overall dimensions vary with installation. The Felix

York and Museum of Modern Art, New York 


of the importance placed on the individual in the production of 
art. Gran Fury, a spin-off of ACT-UP, its name taken from the 
Plymouth automobile used by the then-repressive New York 
Police Department, made posters, such as the 1988 The 
Government Has Blood on Its Hands , the bold type of the title 
appearing above and below a large blood-red handprint. 

THE AIDS CRISIS! FELIX GONZALEZ-TORRES Felix 
Gonzalez-Torres (1957-1996), a founding member of the collab¬ 
orative Group Material in 1980, produced some of the most 
powerful AIDS-related art, although his work encompasses a 
wide range of social issues. Gonzalez-Torres, who was born in 
Cuba and came to Florida in the 1981 in the mass-exodus called 
the Mariel boatlift, can best be described as a Conceptual artist 
working in a Minimalist mode. He is the quintessential 
Postmodern artist, since his art is issue-drive and seemingly obliv¬ 
ious to the concept of style. His mediums include, for example, 
two identical wall clocks hung side by side, which can be viewed 
as lovers who fade and die as the batteries wear out; a string of 
lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, the lights evoking tears, or 
even souls, and like the clocks, eventually burning out; and a pile 
of brightly wrapped candy, the weight of the artist s lover, which 
visitors may take and eat, the gradual disappearance of the candy 
reflecting, among other things, the lover s body being consumed 
by AIDS. 

Like so many artists of the 1980s, Gonzalez-Torres took his 
work out of a specifically art context and into the public domain. 
As part of a 1991 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 
New York, he arranged for a black-and-white photograph of an 
empty, unmade bed, in which two people had slept, to be installed 
on 24 billboards around the city (fig. 30.23). A classic Postmodern 
picture, it was highly suggestive and subject to broad interpreta¬ 
tion. Despite being devoid of text, the simple image of an unmade 
bed spoke volumes. It conjured thoughts of intimacy, relation¬ 
ships, and love, as well as of loss, absence, and death. For some 
viewers, the image of the empty bed evoked the thousands of 
men, women, and children who had become victims of the AIDS 
epidemic, creating public awareness and discussion of the disease. 
In contrast to the overt propaganda of Gran Fury, Gonzalez- 
Torres s work is poetic and understated. Gonzalez-Torres died of 
AIDS at the age of 38. 

A PREOCCUPATION WITH THE BODY! KIKI SMITH 

The death and suffering of AIDS victims brought about a new 
awareness of the body, especially its vulnerability and frailty. One 
artist to explore the vincibility of the body and the brevity of life 
is New Yorker Kiki Smith (b. 1954). In the 1980s, she created a 
work consisting of eight identical jars of blood, and another pre¬ 
senting silver-coated watercooler bottles etched with the names of 
bodily fluids such as tears, milk, saliva, vomit, semen, urine, and 
sweat that a viewer is led to believe is in the jars. Because these 
works contain repeated elements, they resemble Minimal Art. Yet 
the Conceptual component—the thoughts we have when con¬ 
fronting any of these bodily fluids—packs a powerful, visceral

response and emotional punch. Smith has reduced existence to an 
elemental essence, stripping away individuality and uniqueness to 
reveal the basic elements of life. 

Toward 1990, Smith began constructing entire figures, usually 
using such impermanent materials as paper, papier-mache, and 
wax, which served as a metaphor for the fragility of the body and 
the transience of life. In the untitled 1990 work reproduced here 
(fig. 30.24), Smith cleverly revives the Classical tradition of the 
nude figure. However, we are viewing neither Greek gods and 
goddesses nor heroic athletes and soldiers. Rather, Smith portrays 
flesh-and-blood mortals. The woman oozes milk from her breast 
and the man semen from his penis, attributes of nourishment, pro¬ 
creation, and life. But death prevails, seen in the form of the limp 
figures slumped on their poles and the repulsive discoloration of 
the skin. Smith presents the entire life cycle, but it is the sadness 
of deterioration and our ultimate fate of death that prevail. 

THE FUTILITY OF PRESERVING LIFE! DAMIEN HIRST 

One of the most powerful statements about death, decay, and 
impermanence comes from the British artist Damien Hirst 
(b. 1965). Hirst, who has a flamboyant personality and is often 


accused of being a publicity hound, headed a group of London 
artists who came to the fore in 1988, when Hirst organized a stu¬ 
dent exhibition entitled Freeze in a London warehouse. The group 
created a public sensation and a critical storm due to their outra¬ 
geous subject matter. Their imagery got even more outrageous in 
the 1990s, highlighted by Hirsts The Physical Impossibility of 
Death in the Mind of Someone Living, , consisting of a dead shark 
floating in a tank of formaldehyde and shown in a 1992 Saatchi 
Gallery exhibition titled Young British Artists. The show also 
included Hirst s 1990 One Thousand Years , a glass case filled with 
flies and maggots feeding off a rotting cows head. In addition, 
Hirst has made beautiful, ethereal paintings incorporating dead 
butterflies and abstractions using dead flies stuck to an enormous 
canvas. In Mother and Child Divided (fig. 30.25), shown at the 
Venice Biennale in 1993, a cow and a calf, each divided in two, 
float in four tanks of formaldehyde. Using a Minimalist seriality, 
Hirst placed the bisected cows into identical tanks, thus creating 
a feeling of scientific objectivity. Even the nearly identical halves 
of each cow are multiples, that is, a repetition of the same form. 
The Minimalist tanks function as frames, the cow and calf as 
“realist pictures.” The beauty and repulsiveness of this daring

presentation is fascinating. And because we are looking at real 
objects, we are literally confronting death, which is a powerful 
experience. We are also witnessing a vain attempt to prolong the 
physical existence of the animals. An especially poignant aspect of 
this work is the separation of mother from calf, a reminder of the 
life that once was and the emotional attachment of mother and 
child. While Hirsts subject matter may seem sensational, the 
animals he displays in formaldehyde tanks are powerful and 
unforgettable metaphors of life and death. 

The Power of Installation, Video, and 
Large-Scale Photography 

As we saw in the last chapter, installation art had existed since the 
late 1950s, when introduced by Alan Kaprow and called Environ¬ 
ments. And by the early 1960s, we saw Robert Whitman integrat¬ 
ing film into installation, thus anticipating video installation, and 
Nam June Paik taking a lead role in popularizing Video Art. At 
the same time, avant-garde artists, such as Joseph Kosuth, rede¬ 
fined photography, using the medium on a large scale and inte¬ 
grating it with other mediums. But in the 1980s, installation, video, 
and large-scale photography entered a new stage, their popularity 


exploding to new heights again in the 1990s. Not only did all three 
art forms become more popular, they got bigger, more sophisti¬ 
cated, and more refined, moving away from the more experimen¬ 
tal, tentative, or temporary look of these mediums in the 1960s 
and 1970s. And now artists often worked primarily in these medi¬ 
ums, not being part-time practitioners as before. And like art in 
the Postmodern era, the work often drew heavily on earlier styles 
and historical periods, and showed no fear of being anecdotal, 
often having elaborate narratives as opposed to being abstract. 

ILYA KABAKOV Of the legions of installation artists who 
emerged in the 1980s, one of the most engaging is the Russian Ilya 
Kabakov (b. 1933), who emigrated from Moscow to New York in 
1988. In Russia from 1981 to 1988, he made a series of rooms he 
called Ten Characters that replicated the types of seedy communal 
apartments assigned to people by the Russian state under the 
Communist regime. Each was inhabited by an imaginary person 
with an “unusual idea, one all-absorbing passion belonging to him 
alone.” One spectacular cubicle was The Man Who Flew into 
Space from His Apartment (fig. 30.26). We see the room after its 
occupant has achieved his dream of being ejected into outer space, 
hurled through the ceiling from a catapult suspended by springs

OURCE 


Ilya Kabakov (b. 1933) 



On installations 

Kabakov discusses his installations entitled Ten Rooms, which deal with 
li fe in Soviet Russia. He especially emphasizes the importance of the 
space in his installations , claiming the rooms have a spirit that establishes 
the mood and meaning of the work. 



H ow does this “spirit of the place” seize you? In the first place, 
the rooms are always deconstructive, asymmetrical to the point 
of absurdity or, on the contrary, insanely symmetrical. In the second 
place, they look dull, oppressing, semidark, but this is not so because 
the windows are small or weak lamps are on. The main thing is the 
light both during the day and at night is arranged so excruciatingly, so 
awkwardly that it creates a peculiar discomfort distinctive to that 
place alone. The third important feature of our rooms’ effect is their 
wretched, ridiculous preparation from the planning stage to the real¬ 
ization: everything is crooked, unfinished, full of stains, cracks; even 
in the most durable materials, there is something temporary, strange, 
made haphazardly, just to “pass. ” 

What is especially depressing is the fact that everything is old, but 
at the same time it isn’t clear when it was made, it doesn’t have all the 


noble “patina of time,” the marks of “wonderful days of old”; it is old 
in the sense of being decrepit and useless. All of this is despite the fact 
that it might have been made and painted only yesterday—it already 
appears outdated, marked for disposal. There is an impression of dust 
and dirt in every place and in everything—on the walls, at the ceiling, 
on the floor, in the corners. But the sensation is even stronger that 
these rooms, including private apartments, do not belong to anyone, 
that they are no-one’s and that, in essence, no-one cares in the least 
about them. No-one loves them, people live in them temporarily and 
will leave not remembering them at all, like a train station, an under¬ 
ground crosswalk or a toilet at the bus station. ... 

Sociality, being completely interlinked, was the natural means of 
survival, the very same traditional Russian “commune” which later 
also entered Soviet reality, in which you as a voluntary or subordi¬ 
nated participant were forever drowned, dissolved. But on the other 
hand, the commune saved you, supported you, didn’t let you disap¬ 
pear or perish in loneliness, in despair, in a state of material or moral 
neglect. Every second of your life, you belonged to some kind of 
community....The atmosphere of the surrounding space was, in 
essence, its “spirit.” ... And you caught this spirit immediately, all 
you had to do was to enter this or that space.

and alluding to the space race between the U.S. and Russia. Like 
the other rooms, this one is accompanied by a grim story, worthy 
of the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. The text, the col¬ 
lapsed ceiling, limp sling, and clutter become a tableau of life in 
Communist Russia, where claustrophobic squalor has brought 
about a hopeless delusional state, and flights of fantasy are the only 
escape from the drudgery of daily life. The ruin we are witnessing 
in The Man Who Flew into Space is not just the devastation of one 
man’s life, but rather the shattered dream of the utopia in which 
Tatlin, the Constructivists, the Dadaists, and the Communist 
world in general had so firmly believed. Kabakov’s installation is 
presented as a relic of an actual event, and like any relic, it pos¬ 
sesses a powerful aura, almost impossible to achieve in conven¬ 
tional painting and sculpture. (See Primary Source , above.) 

BILL VIOLA An especially popular form of installation is video 
or film installation. Among the best-known video artists is Bill 
Viola (b. 1951), who was also one of the first to specialize in video, 
coming at the tail end of the first generation of video artists. He 
started working with the medium in the 1970s after graduating 
from Syracuse University, his earliest work being primarily single¬ 
channel video presented on a television monitor. By the early 
1980s, he was projecting video onto large walls and incorporating

it into installations or environments containing real objects. 
Although Viola s work does not always have a clear sequential 
narrative, it always has a theme, usually an unsettling, intense 
questioning of the meaning of existence that in part is brought 
about through intense sensory experience for a viewer. 

One of Viola s best-known—and simplest—video projections 
is The Crossing (fig. 30.27). In two simultaneous, approximately 
ten-minute projections, shown side by side, or on either side of a 
single screen, a plainly dressed man approaches from the distance, 
passing through an empty, darkened space and stopping when his 
body, now nearly 12 feet tall, fills the screen. In one projection, 
water begins to drip on him, eventually becoming a deluge that 
washes him away. In the other, a small fire erupts at his feet, 
increasingly swelling into a bonfire that ultimately consumes him. 
The projections end with water hauntingly dripping in one, and a 
fire mysteriously smoldering in the other. Both videos are accom¬ 
panied by a deafening soundtrack of pouring water and crackling 
fire, which intensifies the force of the imagery and heightens its 
visceral impact. Viola s elemental symbols of fire and water seem 
to have destroyed the figure. Or perhaps the two forces have 
brought about a transformative process, as the body dissolves into 
a spiritual state, crossing into a higher reality and becoming one 
with the unseen universal forces. We do not know. The video 
relentlessly instills a sense of the physical and sensory, and then 
suddenly leaves us in an existential void. Viola s work is a quest 
for the spiritual, reflecting the influence of Zen Buddhism, 
Islamic Sufism, and Christian mysticism. Viola summed up the 
thrust of much of his work when he said, “And those two realiza¬ 
tions: that you are connected deeply to the entire cosmos and at 
the same time you are mortal and you are fragile and inconse¬ 
quential; the search for meaning that human beings have been 
engaged with since the beginning of time is part of the reconcilia¬ 
tion of those two things.” 

LARGE-SCALE PHOTOGRAPHY: ANDREAS GURSKY As 

we have already seen when discussing Joseph Kosuth in the last 
chapter (see page 1062), photography underwent a dramatic 
change beginning in the late 1960s as the medium was appropri¬ 
ated by visual artists who, because they were not trained as 
photographers, broke all of photography’s traditions. These new 
photographers worked on a large scale, often did not take their 
own photographs, generally did not print their own work, and 
occasionally integrated photography into other mediums. 
Beginning in the 1980s, large-scale photography entered a new 
stage. For one thing, by the end of the 1980s, it became more 
prevalent, to the point that it may very well have superseded 
painting for the art world s attention. Second, it got bigger, with 
more and more artists working on a larger and larger scale. Cindy 
Sherman and Barbara Kruger, for example, made 6- and 8-foot 
pictures, while the Canadian Jeff Wall worked on a billboard 
scale, backlighting his images, which were transparencies in light¬ 
boxes. And third, it was increasingly being made by artists for 
whom it was their primary medium. Diisseldorf especially pro¬ 
duced a large number of major photographers, mainly due to the

innovative black-and-white photography of Bernd (1931-2007) 
and Hflla (b. 1934) Becher, and because Bernd, like Joseph Beuys, 
taught at the Art Academy. Becher s students included such 
renowned photographers as Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, 
Candida Hoffer, and Eiger Esser. 

They also included Andreas Gursky (b. 1955). We can get a 
sense of his scale from his 2000 Chromogenic color print 
Shanghai (fig 30.28), which is over 9 Vi feet high. Looking at this 
work, we get the impression that Gursky has an exceptional 
eye that has allowed him to discover remarkable compositions in 
the real world. Here, as in so many of his works, he seems to have 
discovered a wonderful geometry, which gives his image 
the look of Minimalist Art (see page 1056), yet another example 
of a Postmodern appropriation of an earlier style. But in fact he 
has digitally manipulated his images—sharpening lines, empha¬ 
sizing certain colors while suppressing others, heightening value 
contrasts or minimizing them, and, on occasion, removing

THE ART HISTORIAN’ 



The Changing Art Market 


T he world of contemporary art is as complex and varied as the art 
itself. Museums, commercial galleries, private dealers, auction 
houses, art fairs, international exhibitions, collectors from all strata of 
society, critics, curators, art historians, books, and a vast mass media 
that includes the Internet are some of the pieces that form the kalei¬ 
doscopic art market of the twenty-first century. 

How different this conglomerate of influences is from the late 
medieval and Early Renaissance world that was largely defined by 
artists’ guilds, the apprentice system, and a patronage system domi¬ 
nated by aristocrats and the Church. The rise of academies in the six¬ 
teenth and seventeenth centuries, especially the French Royal 
Academy in 1 648, marked a shift of power to the academy system and 
its accompanying exhibitions (called Salons in Paris) which showcased 
the work of members and students. Historians published the first 
books on artists during this period. The eighteenth century witnessed 
the rise of prominent art auctions in Paris and London, the opening of 
the first public art museums in those cities, and the beginning of what 
many consider to be the first art criticism (see pages 811 -1 2). In the 
nineteenth century, the French Salon changed from a members’ exhi¬ 
bition into an open show that was juried and that presented hundreds 
of artists and thousands of works. Artists from all over Europe and the 
Americas aspired to exhibit at the Paris Salon, which, although domi¬ 
nated by the French, in effect became the first international showcase 
and an important venue for attracting patrons and commercial 
success. By the end of the nineteenth century, art dealers, who had vir¬ 
tually always been around, became a major force in the art world, 
especially in Paris. 

Today, one of the strongest influences on an artist’s career is repre¬ 
sentation by a prestigious dealer with a reputation for selecting 
“important” artists. Also significant is exhibiting and being collected 
by major museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, 
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Tate Gallery in 
London, the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, and the National Museum of 
Modern Art in Paris. These are just a few of the many museums known 
for presenting prestigious exhibitions and collecting contemporary art. 

Artists also aspire to be included in the big international exhibi¬ 
tions, the twentieth- and twenty-first-century equivalent of the nine¬ 
teenth-century French Salons, although the artists are generally invited 
by curators and do not submit work to a jury. One of the oldest inter¬ 
national exhibitions is the Venice Biennale, established in 1 903 and 
located in a park in Venice. Today, the show occurs once every two 
years and takes place in permanent pavilions owned by the various 
countries which present their own artists. Such international shows 
were often conceived to promote the host cities and to encourage their 
economic development. For example, Andrew Carnegie founded the 
Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh in 1 895, and the following year 
he established what is now known as the Carnegie International in 


order to draw international attention to Pittsburgh. Both the Venice 
Biennale and the Carnegie International, however, only gained their 
current prestige after World War II, when they were joined by other 
major international shows, such as the Documenta in Kassel, Germany, 
which is held every four years, and the Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil. In 
the last few decades, many other international biennials have joined 
the art scene, including those in Istanbul, Havana, Cairo, and 
Johannesburg. A major venue for American artists has been New 
York’s Whitney Museum of American Art, which was founded in 1 930 
and has always held an annual or biennial exhibition. 

Despite the excitement generated by fairs and galleries, however, 
contemporary art has largely lived in the shadow of Old Masters and 
Impressionism, and, as the twentieth century progressed, early 
European Modernism. It was not until the 1 970s that contemporary art 
became fashionable. Triggering the stampede to buy work by living 
artists was the sensationally successful auction of the Pop Art collec¬ 
tion of Robert and Ethel Scull at Sotheby’s in New York in 1 973. Such 
major auction houses as Sotheby’s and Christie’s, both dating to eigh¬ 
teenth-century London, had long sold contemporary art, but in small 
quantities and with little fanfare. But after the Scull auction, countless 
collectors rushed into the contemporary arena, and in the last 25 
years, auctions of contemporary art have shared the limelight with 
sales of Impressionism and European Modernism. This collecting fever 
spurred the appearance of numerous international art fairs, including 
Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland; Art Basel Miami in Miami Beach; the 
Frieze Art Fair in London; the Armory Show in New York; and the Foire 
Internationale d’Art Contemporain or FI AC (International Fair of 
Contemporary Art) in Paris. Every year, these high-end art fairs are 
flooded with tens of thousands of collectors and visitors scouting for 
new work and new artists.

objects. In some respects, he colors and draws like a painter. 
And his extremely realistic-looking images, which have to be 
fact since after all they are photographs, are a deconstruction of 
photography since they serve as evidence of how all images are 


artificial and reflect what Derrida would describe as one person s 
hierarchy. 

If it were not for the title, Shanghai , we would have no idea 
where Gursky s photograph was shot, for there is nothing to give

this building a sense of place. And that is the point. From a decon¬ 
struction standpoint, the title is in a sense an integral part of the 
visual work, underscoring how the title affects meaning. As social 
commentary, the work points up how global all cultures have 
become. Gursky travels the world to acquire his images, photo¬ 
graphing such motifs as hotel lobbies, stock exchanges, office 
towers, department stores, and crowds at rock concerts: The 
latter, instead of appearing Minimalist, have the allover look of a 
Jackson Pollock painting, another stylistic appropriation. In 
every instance, if it were not for the title, we would be clueless not 
only about the locale but even the nation or hemisphere featured 
in Gursky s highly objective and unemotional images, which sug¬ 
gest how homogeneous the world has become. 

GLOBAL ART 

The closing decade of the twentieth century marked the rise of a 
world art. With the arrival of the Internet and satellite communi¬ 
cations, artists in even the most remote areas no longer operate in 
isolation. More artists than ever have access to what is being 
produced in New York, London, Paris, Diisseldorf, Beijing, and 
Tokyo. Jet travel circulates artists from Korea to Cairo, from 
Johannesburg to Sao Paulo, and from Basel to Dubai, for exhibi¬ 
tions and art fairs. (See The Art Historian's Lens , page 1104.) The 
entire world is artistically bound together, transforming it into one 
large art gallery and making it nearly impossible to talk about art 
in one hemisphere without talking about developments occurring 
everywhere else. Now, artists worldwide use the same art language, 
deal with similar issues, and avidly follow each other s work. 

Many critics predicted that the rise of a global art world would 
result in a global art, art that is basically homogeneous. But this is 
hardly the case. Since Postmodernism emphasizes issues and not 
style, artists often make work that is very personal and that 
reflects their personal experience. As we have seen, gender, race, 


ethnicity, sexual orientation, politics, and economics have been 
dominant themes in Western culture since the 1980s, and the same 
holds true worldwide, with contemporary art from Lebanon, 
Vietnam, India, Iran, and Colombia, for example, embracing 
issues specific to these countries. Or, as expressed by the 
Ghanaian artist El Anatsui, “Art is something that is environ¬ 
ment-based. It takes its roots from a certain soil. ” 

El Anatsui, Adinkra Signs, 
and Postmodern Ambiguity 

El Anatsui (b. 1944) was born in Ghana, and studied art at the 
University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, his education 
focusing on contemporary art, largely made in a formalist, 
Modernist tradition. In 1975, he began teaching at the University 
of Nigeria in Nsukka, where he lives today. Initially working in 
clay and wood and reflecting traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian 
art and themes, he now works with the flattened metal caps and 
bottleneck foil of liquor bottles, weaving this metal together with 
copper wire to create what look like enormous, luxurious tapes¬ 
tries or fabrics. These brightly colored aluminum mosaics, such as 
Dzesi II (fig. 30.29), evoke Nigerian and Ghanaian textiles and 
designs, the hard metal being visually transformed into something 
soft. For Anatsui, these caps are a reminder of the liquor that 
European traders brought to Africa as barter and therefore could 
be seen as a reference to trade, commodity, and even the beginning 
of globalization. The artist has also said that “metals and liquor in 
many cultures, especially African, have this association with the 
spiritual, with healing. Just think about the many ways a hand must 
open metal caps to pour out schnapps for prayers and libations. ” 
In Dzesi IT the protrusion of concentric circles placed within 
a square suggests something ritualistic. According to the artist, 
this form came about “with thoughts about the zero sign, 0— 
which can mean a lot or nothing. And I think is a kind of harking 
to Adinkra symbols I had worked with earlier.” Adinkra, which 


CHAPTER 30 THE POSTMODERN ERA: ART SINCE 1 980 1 1 05 










translates as saying farewell, are West African symbols, printed on 
fabric originally worn at funerals, although they have wider uses 
now. The symbols encapsulate aphorisms that help mourners 
meditate on life, and the concentric circles, according to Antasui, 
are the “king of these signs, the most conspicuous and attention- 
grabbing, which I think has focus-inducing properties. ” The cen¬ 
tral zero is thus a form upon which to mediate. And it is also a 
Postmodern void to which viewers can assign meaning. Not only 
does the meaning of the work have a Postmodern ambiguity, but 
so does the form of the sculpture itself. For travel, the artist folds 
these enormous reliefs until they are small enough to fit into a 
box; when unfurled, they do not automatically resume their orig¬ 
inal shape, allowing curators and collectors in the artist s absence, 
and with his blessing, to restructure the work, implementing what 
Anastui calls a “nomadic aesthetic. ” 

Cai Guo-Qiang: Projects for Extraterrestrials 

It seems only fitting to end this book with Cai Guo-Qiang (b. 
1957), a Chinese artist living in New York since 1995, with a sec¬ 
ond house in Beijing, which he needed as the director of Visual 
and Special Effects for the 2008 Olympics. With the adoption of 
capitalism, China has become a powerhouse in art, not only satu¬ 
rating the art world with artists but becoming a major art center 
and market for art itself. Cai is among the most visible artists 
working today, and he brings to the new global art a Chinese 
background and perspective. Like Gonzalez-Torres, Cai is prima¬ 
rily a Conceptual artist working in a broad range of mediums. His 
oeuvre, however, is dominated by installation art and the use of 
explosions, namely fireworks, which he used so effectively in the 


opening ceremonies at the 2008 Olympics and which have 
become his signature style. By using gunpowder, a Chinese inven¬ 
tion, Cai is able to underscore his cultural identity, which he does 
as well by working with Chinese calligraphy, dragons, Chinese 
medicine, and feng shui, an ancient art and science that reveals 
how to balance the energy of any given space to assure health and 
good fortune. He started working with explosives while living in 
Japan between 1986 and 1995, reveling in the spontaneity and 
chance of the medium and finding it an emotional release from the 
stifling artistic and social environment of precapitalist 1980s 
China. As the artist explains: “Explosions make you feel something 
intense at the very core of your being because, while you can 
arrange explosives as you please, you cannot control the explosion 
itself. And this fills you with a great deal of freedom. ” Cai “draws” 
with explosives, on a small scale by drawing with gunpowder on 
large sheets of paper that he then ignites, and on a large scale with 
fireworks, which sometimes resemble Chinese calligraphy. 

In 2003, Cai was commissioned by New York City and the 
Central Park Conservancy to create an explosion piece in Central 
Park. Titled Light Cycle: Explosion Project for Central Park (fig. 
30.30), the work lasted four minutes and was divided into three 
parts: “Signal towers” (pillars of light), “The Light Cycle” (a 
series of haloes), and “White Night” (small-shell explosions of 
brilliant white light). The degree to which Cai controls the explo¬ 
sions is remarkable. He draws and paints with the medium. 
Through his work, Cai seeks to capture a spiritual essence. He has 
said that his work is for extraterrestrials, and he has subtitled 
many of his explosions “Project for Extraterrestrials. ” Just as the 
art world has become global, so Cai, perhaps with a little wink, is 
looking beyond earth, seeking to create art for the universe.

stars, 4 minutes. Realized at Central Park, New York, 7:45 p.m. September 15, 2003.

and made public in 1839, was modified and accelerat¬ 
ed as daguerreotypes gained popularity. 

D E E SI S . From the Greek word for “entreaty. ” The 
representation of Christ enthroned between the Vir¬ 
gin Mary and St. John the Baptist, frequent in Byzan¬ 
tine mosaics and depictions of the Last Judgment. It

DIKKA. An elevated, flat-topped platform in a 
mosque used by the muezzin or cantor. 

DIPTERAL. Term used to describe a Greek or 
Roman building—often a temple or a stoa—with a

tablet used for writing. (2) A pair of ivory carvings or 
panel paintings, usually hinged together. 

DOLMEN. A structure formed by two or more 
large, upright stones capped by a horizontal slab. 
Thought to be a prehistoric tomb. 

DOME. A true dome is a vaulted roof of circular, 
polygonal, or elliptical plan, formed with hemispher¬ 
ical or ovoidal curvature. May be supported by a cir¬ 
cular wall or drum and by pendentives or related 
constructions. Domical coverings of many other sorts 
have been devised. 

D O M U S . Latin word for “house. ” A detached, one- 
family Roman house with rooms frequently grouped 
around two open courts. The first court, called the 
atrium , was used for entertaining and conducting 
business. The second court, usually with a garden and 
surrounded by a peristyle or colonnade, was for the 
private use of the family. 

DORIC COLUMN. A column characterized by a 
simple cushionlike abacus and the absence of a base. 
One of three styles of column consistently used by 
Greek and Roman architects. 

DROLERIES. French word for “jests.” Used to 
describe the lively animals and small figures in the 
margins of late medieval manuscripts and in wood 
carvings on furniture. 

D R O M O S . A pathway, found, for instance, in 
Bronze Age, Aegean and Etruscan tomb structures. 

DRUM. (1) A section of the shaft of a column. (2) A 
circular-shaped wall supporting a dome. 

DRYPOINT. A type of intaglio printmaking in 
which a sharp metal needle is use to carve lines and a 
design into a (usually) copper plate. The act of draw¬ 
ing pushes up a burr of metal filings, and so, when the 
plate is inked, ink will be retained by the burr to cre¬ 
ate a soft and deep tone that will be unique to each 
print. The burr can only last for a few printings. Both 
the print and the process are called drypoint. 

EARLY ENGLISH STYLE. A term used to 
describe Gothic architecture in England during 
the early- and mid-13th century. The style demon¬ 
strates the influence of architectural features 
developed during the Early Gothic period in 
France, which are combined with Anglo-Norman 
Romanesque features. 

EARTHWORKS. Usually very large scale, outdoor 
artwork that is produced by altering the natural

ENGRAVING. (1) A means of embellishing metal 
surfaces or gemstones by incising a design on the sur¬ 
face. (2) A print made by cutting a design into a metal 
plate (usually copper) with a pointed steel tool 
known as a burin. The burr raised on either side of 
the incised line is removed. Ink is then rubbed into 
the V-shaped grooves and wiped off the surface. The 
plate, covered with a damp sheet of paper, is run 
through a heavy press. The image on the paper is the 
reverse of that on the plate. When a fine steel needle is 
used instead of a burin and the burr is retained, a dry- 
point engraving results, characterized by a softer line. 
These techniques are called, respectively, engraving 
and drypoint. 

ENNEASTYLE. A term used to describe the facade 
of a Greek or Roman temple, meaning that it has nine 
columns. 

ENTABLATURE. (l)Ina classical order, the entire

ENTASIS. A swelling of the shaft of a column. 

ENVIRONMENT. In art, environment refers to the 
Earth itself as a stage for Environmental art, works 
that can be enormously large yet very minimal and 
abstract. These works can be permanent or transitory. 
The term Earth art is also used to describe these art¬ 
works. 

EVENTS. A term first used by John Cage in the 
early 1950s to refer to his multimedia events at Black 
Mount College in North Carolina that included 
dance, painting, music, and sculpture. The term was

thereafter by the conceptual and performance group 
Fluxus, which included Brecht.

atmospheric or aerial perspective, this is accom¬

and value and in the contrast of light and dark as 
objects are depicted as farther and farther away in the 
picture. In color artwork, as objects recede into the 
distance, all colors tend toward a light bluish-gray 
tone. In scientific or linear perspective, developed in 
Italy in the 15th century, a mathematical system is 
used based on orthogonals receding to vanishing 
points on the horizon. Transversals intersect the 
orthogonals at right angles at distances derived math¬ 
ematically. Since this presupposes an absolutely sta¬

Books for Further Reading 


This list is intended to be as practical as possible. It is 
therefore limited to books of general interest that were 
printed over the past 20 years or have been generally 
available recently However, certain indispensable vol¬ 
umes that have yet to be superseded are retained. This 
restriction means omitting numerous classics long out of 
print, as well as much specialized material of interest to 
the serious student. The reader is thus referred to the 
many specialized bibliographies noted below.
